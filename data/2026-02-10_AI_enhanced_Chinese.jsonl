We argue this brittleness is often data-induced: when images carry \"silent\" evidence and queries leave key semantics implicit, a single embedding pass must both reason and compress, encouraging spurious feature matching. We propose a data-centric framework that decouples these roles by externalizing reasoning before retrieval. Using a strong Vision--Language Model, we make implicit semantics explicit by densely captioning visual evidence in corpus entries, resolving ambiguous multimodal references in queries, and rewriting verbose instructions into concise retrieval constraints. Inference-time enhancement alone is insufficient; the retriever must be trained on these semantically dense representations to avoid distribution shift and fully exploit the added signal. Across M-BEIR, our reasoning-augmented training method yields consistent gains over strong baselines, with ablations showing that corpus enhancement chiefly benefits knowledge-intensive queries while query enhancement is critical for compositional modification requests.

Nevertheless, they still suffer from inherent limitations in resource efficiency, context management, and multimodal perception. Based on these observations, Lemon Agent is introduced, a multi-agent orchestrator-worker system built on a newly proposed AgentCortex framework, which formalizes the classic Planner-Executor-Memory paradigm through an adaptive task execution mechanism. Our system integrates a hierarchical self-adaptive scheduling mechanism that operates at both the overall orchestrator layer and workers layer. This mechanism can dynamically adjust computational intensity based on task complexity. It enables orchestrator to allocate one or more workers for parallel subtask execution, while workers can further improve operational efficiency by invoking tools concurrently. By virtue of this two-tier architecture, the system achieves synergistic balance between global task coordination and local task execution, thereby optimizing resource utilization and task processing efficiency in complex scenarios. To reduce context redundancy and increase information density during parallel steps, we adopt a three-tier progressive context management strategy. To make fuller use of historical information, we propose a self-evolving memory system, which can extract multi-dimensional valid information from all historical experiences to assist in completing similar tasks. Furthermore, we provide an enhanced MCP toolset.

In flexible manufacturing, industrial embodied intelligence faces three core challenges: accurate process modeling and monitoring under limited perception, dynamic balancing between flexible adaptation and high-precision control, and the integration of general-purpose skills with specialized industrial operations. Accordingly, this survey reviews existing work from three viewpoints: Industrial Eye, Industrial Hand, and Industrial Brain. At the perception level (Industrial Eye), multimodal data fusion and real-time modeling in complex dynamic settings are examined. At the control level (Industrial Hand), flexible, adaptive, and precise manipulation for complex manufacturing processes is analyzed. At the decision level (Industrial Brain), intelligent optimization methods for process planning and line scheduling are summarized. By considering multi-level collaboration and interdisciplinary integration, this work reveals the key technological pathways of embodied intelligence for closed-loop optimization of perception-decision-execution in manufacturing systems. A three-stage evolution model for the development of embodied intelligence in flexible manufacturing scenarios, comprising cognition enhancement, skill transition, and system evolution, is proposed, and future development trends are examined, to offer both a theoretical framework and practical guidance for the interdisciplinary advancement of industrial embodied intelligence in the context of flexible manufacturing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u9762\u5411\u67d4\u6027\u5236\u9020\u7684\u5de5\u4e1a\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u4ece\u611f\u77e5\uff08\u5de5\u4e1a\u4e4b\u773c\uff09\u3001\u63a7\u5236\uff08\u5de5\u4e1a\u4e4b\u624b\uff09\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\uff08\u5de5\u4e1a\u4e4b\u8111\uff09\u4e09\u5c42\u9762\u68b3\u7406\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8ba4\u77e5\u589e\u5f3a\u2014\u6280\u80fd\u8fc1\u79fb\u2014\u7cfb\u7edf\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u53d1\u5c55\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u67d4\u6027\u5236\u9020\u4e2d\u5de5\u4e1a\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u9762\u4e34\u611f\u77e5\u53d7\u9650\u4e0b\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u5efa\u6a21\u76d1\u63a7\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u9002\u5e94\u4e0e\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u3001\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u4e13\u7528\u5de5\u827a\u878d\u5408\u4e09\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u2018\u5de5\u4e1a\u4e4b\u773c\u2019\uff08\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u5b9e\u65f6\u5efa\u6a21\uff09\u3001\u2018\u5de5\u4e1a\u4e4b\u624b\u2019\uff08\u67d4\u6027\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u64cd\u63a7\uff09\u3001\u2018\u5de5\u4e1a\u4e4b\u8111\u2019\uff08\u5de5\u827a\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u4ea7\u7ebf\u8c03\u5ea6\u667a\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\uff09\u4e09\u4e2a\u89c6\u89d2\u7cfb\u7edf\u7efc\u8ff0\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6f14\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5236\u9020\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u611f\u77e5-\u51b3\u7b56-\u6267\u884c\u95ed\u73af\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u8ba4\u77e5\u589e\u5f3a\u2192\u6280\u80fd\u8fc1\u79fb\u2192\u7cfb\u7edf\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u53d1\u5c55\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u67d4\u6027\u5236\u9020\u4e2d\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u9700\u5f3a\u8c03\u591a\u5c42\u7ea7\u534f\u540c\u4e0e\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u8be5\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e3a\u7406\u8bba\u6df1\u5316\u4e0e\u4ea7\u4e1a\u843d\u5730\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u65b9\u5411\u6307\u5f15\u3002"}}

We investigate a fundamental question, does visual rendering truly decouple a model from tokenization constraints? Focusing on four Indonesian low-resource local languages that have their own non-Latin scripts (i.e., Javanese, Balinese, Sundanese, and Lampungnese), we evaluate the impact of script-tokenizer alignment within the DualGPT architecture. Our results show that, despite visual rendering, reintegrating a text tokenizer into the architecture reintroduces the same issue that pixel-based language modeling aims to resolve, which is the tokenizer misalignment problem. Despite having lower OOV and fertility rates, we show that the Llama 2 tokenizer performs significantly worse than a custom tokenizer, with improvements of up to 30.15 chrF++.

Dey"], "title": "Scalable spatial point process models for forensic footwear analysis", "comment": null, "summary": "Shoe print evidence recovered from crime scenes plays a key role in forensic investigations. By examining shoe prints, investigators can determine details of the footwear worn by suspects. However, establishing that a suspect's shoes match the make and model of a crime scene print may not be sufficient. Typically, thousands of shoes of the same size, make, and model are manufactured, any of which could be responsible for the print. Accordingly, a popular approach used by investigators is to examine the print for signs of ``accidentals,'' i.e., cuts, scrapes, and other features that accumulate on shoe soles after purchase due to wear. While some patterns of accidentals are common on certain types of shoes, others are highly distinctive, potentially distinguishing the suspect's shoe from all others. Quantifying the rarity of a pattern is thus essential to accurately measuring the strength of forensic evidence. In this study, we address this task by developing a hierarchical Bayesian model. Our improvement over existing methods primarily stems from two advancements.

In this paper, we present LLM-FSM, a benchmark that evaluates how well large language models (LLMs) can recover finite-state machine (FSM) behavior from natural-language specifications and translate it into correct register transfer-level (RTL) implementations. Unlike prior specification-to-RTL benchmarks that rely on manually constructed examples, LLM-FSM is built through a fully automated pipeline. LLM-FSM first constructs FSM with configurable state counts and constrained transition structures. It then prompts LLMs to express each FSM in a structured YAML format with an application context, and to further convert that YAML into a natural-language (NL) specification. From the same YAML, our pipeline synthesizes the reference RTL and testbench in a correct-by-construction manner. All 1,000 problems are verified using LLM-based and SAT-solver-based checks, with human review on a subset. Our experiments show that even the strongest LLMs exhibit sharply declining accuracy as FSM complexity increases. We further demonstrate that training-time scaling via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) generalizes effectively to out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks, while increasing test-time compute improves reasoning reliability. Finally, LLM-FSM remains extensible by allowing its FSM complexity to scale with future model capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM-FSM is a novel, automatically generated benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to translate natural-language FSM specifications into correct RTL code; it reveals performance degradation with increasing FSM complexity and shows that SFT and increased test-time compute improve results.", "motivation": "To rigorously evaluate LLMs' finite-state reasoning\u2014critical for hardware design\u2014using a scalable, automated, and verifiable benchmark beyond manually crafted examples.", "method": "LLM-FSM uses an automated pipeline to generate 1,000 FSM problems: synthesizing configurable FSMs, prompting LLMs to produce YAML and NL specifications, and generating correct-by-construction RTL/testbench from YAML; evaluation includes LLM-based, SAT-solver-based, and human verification.", "result": "Strong LLMs show sharply declining accuracy with increasing FSM complexity; supervised fine-tuning (SFT) improves generalization to out-of-distribution tasks; increased test-time compute enhances reasoning reliability.", "conclusion": "LLM-FSM provides a robust, extensible benchmark revealing fundamental limitations in LLMs' finite-state reasoning, while offering actionable insights for improving RTL generation via training and inference strategies."}}

These properties create two practical tensions. First, dense FFNs spend the same compute on every token regardless of context, and they allocate capacity uniformly even when language exhibits highly clustered context structure. Second, continual learning, in the sense of updating the model while serving a data stream, often produces interference because a small update touches broadly shared weights.\n  We propose Attractor Patch Networks (APN), a plug-compatible replacement for the Transformer FFN. APN is a bank of patch experts. A similarity router selects a small top-k set of patches for each token by matching the token representation to learned prototypes. Each selected patch emits a low-rank residual update conditioned on a compact code. The architecture yields conditional, context-specialized nonlinear transformations while preserving the standard Transformer interface.\n  This paper focuses on APN as an architectural primitive. We formalize APN, analyze its expressivity as a piecewise low-rank residual function class, and derive simple interference and stability arguments that make APN naturally compatible with continual learning. In experiments on character-level language modeling, APN achieves competitive perplexity (4.57 vs 4.32 PPL) while enabling dramatically better continual adaptation: when adapting to a shifted domain, APN achieves 2.6 times better retention (11.1 vs 29.4 PPL on the original domain) and 2.8 times better adaptation (6.4 vs 17.8 PPL on the new domain) compared to global fine-tuning of a dense FFN baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAttractor Patch Networks (APN)\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684Transformer\u524d\u9988\u7f51\u7edc\uff08FFN\uff09\u66ff\u4ee3\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u8def\u7531\u548c\u4f4e\u79e9\u6b8b\u5dee\u66f4\u65b0\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3\u6743\u91cd\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9886\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\u65f6\u7684\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0e\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3Transformer\u4e2d\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5f0f\u524d\u9988\u7f51\u7edc\uff08FFN\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u5bc6\u96c6\u3001\u5168\u5c40\u5171\u4eab\u7ed3\u6784\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u4e0d\u5747\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u914d\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u805a\u7c7b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5168\u5c40\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u6613\u5f15\u53d1\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAttractor Patch Networks\uff08APN\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u2018patch\u4e13\u5bb6\u5e93\u2019\u66ff\u4ee3\u6807\u51c6FFN\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u8def\u7531\u5668\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2atoken\u9009\u62e9top-k\u4e2a\u539f\u578bpatch\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9009\u4e2dpatch\u57fa\u4e8e\u7d27\u51d1\u7f16\u7801\u8f93\u51fa\u4f4e\u79e9\u6b8b\u5dee\u66f4\u65b0\uff1b\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5176\u4e3a\u5206\u6bb5\u4f4e\u79e9\u6b8b\u5dee\u51fd\u6570\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u53ca\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0b\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u6291\u5236\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b57\u7b26\u7ea7\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cAPN\u8fbe\u5230\u63a5\u8fd1\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\uff084.57 vs 4.32\uff09\uff1b\u5728\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u5168\u5c40\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u539f\u59cb\u57df\u4fdd\u7559\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u53472.6\u500d\uff08PPL 11.1 vs 29.4\uff09\uff0c\u65b0\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u53472.8\u500d\uff08PPL 6.4 vs 17.8\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "APN\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u7b80\u6d01\u3001\u63a5\u53e3\u517c\u5bb9\u3001\u5177\u5907\u5f3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7279\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5929\u7136\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u53cb\u597d\u6027\u7684FFN\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

While there has been work in automatic approximate convex decompositions of meshes using convex hulls, they are not practical for applications with tight performance budgets such as games due to slower collision detection and inability to manually modify the output while maintaining convexity as compared to manually placed primitives. Rather than convex decomposition with convex hulls, we devise an approach for bottom-up decomposition of an input mesh into convex primitives specifically for rigid body simulation inspired by quadric mesh simplification. This approach fits primitives to complex, real-world meshes that provide plausible simulation performance and are guaranteed to enclose the input surface. We test convex primitive decomposition on over 60 models from Sketchfab, showing the algorithm's effectiveness. On this dataset, convex primitive decomposition has lower one-way mean and median Hausdorff and Chamfer distance from the collider to the input compared to V-HACD and CoACD, with less than one-third of the complexity as measured by total bytes for each collider.

We hypothesize that this may be attributed to the inherent noise, bias, and incompleteness of raw user interaction data in prior continual pre-training (CPT) efforts. This paper introduces a novel, layered framework for generating high-quality synthetic data that circumvents such issues by creating a curated, pedagogical curriculum for the LLM. We provide powerful, direct evidence for the utility of our curriculum by showing that standard sequential models trained on our principled synthetic data significantly outperform ($+130\\%$ on recall@100 for SasRec) models trained on real data in downstream ranking tasks, demonstrating its superiority for learning generalizable user preference patterns. Building on this, we empirically demonstrate, for the first time, robust power-law scaling for an LLM that is continually pre-trained on our high-quality, recommendation-specific data. Our experiments reveal consistent and predictable perplexity reduction across multiple synthetic data modalities.

Existing methods lack principled mechanisms to detect or prevent such failures. To address this gap, we first propose a hierarchical metric that quantifies behavioral uncertainty at three levels: intra-agent (individual reasoning uncertainty), inter-agent (interactive uncertainty), and system-level (output uncertainty). Empirical analysis across several benchmarks reveals that our proposed uncertainty quantification reliably indicates system failures, which demonstrates the validity of using them as diagnostic metrics to indicate the system failure. Subsequently, we propose a mitigation strategy by formulating an uncertainty-driven policy optimization to penalize self-contradiction, peer conflict, and low-confidence outputs in a dynamic debating environment.

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at reasoning and planning, their potential for coordinated control has not been fully explored. Inspired by human teamwork, we present CLiMRS (Cooperative Large-Language-Model-Driven Heterogeneous Multi-Robot System), an adaptive group negotiation framework among LLMs for multi-robot collaboration. This framework pairs each robot with an LLM agent and dynamically forms subgroups through a general proposal planner. Within each subgroup, a subgroup manager leads perception-driven multi-LLM discussions to get commands for actions. Feedback is provided by both robot execution outcomes and environment changes. This grouping-planning-execution-feedback loop enables efficient planning and robust execution. To evaluate these capabilities, we introduce CLiMBench, a heterogeneous multi-robot benchmark of challenging assembly tasks. Our experiments show that CLiMRS surpasses the best baseline, achieving over 40% higher efficiency on complex tasks without sacrificing success on simpler ones. Overall, our results demonstrate that leveraging human-inspired group formation and negotiation principles significantly enhances the efficiency of heterogeneous multi-robot collaboration.

James Cotton", "Thomas Leonard"], "title": "BiomechAgent: AI-Assisted Biomechanical Analysis Through Code-Generating Agents", "comment": null, "summary": "Markerless motion capture is making quantitative movement analysis increasingly accessible, yet analyzing the resulting data remains a barrier for clinicians without programming expertise. We present BiomechAgent, a code-generating AI agent that enables biomechanical analysis through natural language and allows users to querying databases, generating visualizations, and even interpret data without requiring users to write code. To evaluate BiomechAgent's capabilities, we developed a systematic benchmark spanning data retrieval, visualization, activity classification, temporal segmentation, and clinical reasoning. BiomechAgent achieved robust accuracy on data retrieval and visualization tasks and demonstrated emerging clinical reasoning capabilities. We used our dataset to systematically evaluate several of our design decisions. Biomechanically-informed, domain-specific instructions significantly improved performance over generic prompts, and integrating validated specialized tools for gait event detection substantially boosted accuracy on challenging spatiotemporal analysis where the base agent struggled. We also tested BiomechAgent using a local open-weight model instead of a frontier cloud based LLM and found that perform was substantially diminished in most domains other than database retrieval.

Yet conventional supervised learning typically provides only class-level labels, allowing models to achieve high accuracy through shortcut correlations rather than the intended evidence. Human priors can help constrain such behavior, but aligning models to these priors remains challenging because learned representations often diverge from human perception. To address this challenge, we propose an attribution-based human prior alignment method. We encode human priors as input regions that the model is expected to rely on (e.g., bounding boxes), and leverage a highly faithful subset-selection-based attribution approach to expose the model's decision evidence during training. When the attribution region deviates substantially from the prior regions, we penalize reliance on off-prior evidence, encouraging the model to shift its attribution toward the intended regions. This is achieved through a training objective that imposes attribution constraints induced by the human prior. We validate our method on both image classification and click decision tasks in MLLM-based GUI agent models. Across conventional classification and autoregressive generation settings, human prior alignment consistently improves task accuracy while also enhancing the model's decision reasonability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f52\u56e0\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u5148\u9a8c\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u5148\u9a8c\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u533a\u57df\uff08\u5982\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5b50\u96c6\u9009\u62e9\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u60e9\u7f5a\u504f\u79bb\u5148\u9a8c\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7c7b\u522b\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u6377\u5f84\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u800c\u975e\u771f\u6b63\u610f\u56fe\u8bc1\u636e\uff1b\u800c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5148\u9a8c\u867d\u53ef\u7ea6\u675f\u8be5\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u5f81\u5e38\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u5148\u9a8c\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u6307\u5b9a\u8f93\u5165\u533a\u57df\uff08\u5982bounding boxes\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5b50\u96c6\u9009\u62e9\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u66b4\u9732\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f52\u56e0\u7ea6\u675f\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u60e9\u7f5a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u975e\u5148\u9a8c\u533a\u57df\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u548cMLLM-based GUI agent\u7684\u70b9\u51fb\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\uff1b\u5728\u5e38\u89c4\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u5747\u4e00\u81f4\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f52\u56e0\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u5148\u9a8c\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u5173\u6ce8\u9884\u671f\u8bc1\u636e\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u3002"}}

While these metrics are invaluable for valuation and retrospective analysis, they do not define a generative model of how baseball games unfold pitch by pitch, leaving most existing approaches limited to single-step prediction or post-hoc analysis. In this work, we present Neural Sabermetrics with World Model, a Large Language Model (LLM) based play-by-play world model for baseball. We cast baseball games as long auto-regressive sequences of events and continuously pretrain a single LLM on more than ten years of Major League Baseball (MLB) tracking data, comprising over seven million pitch sequences and approximately three billion tokens. The resulting model is capable of predicting multiple aspects of game evolution within a unified framework. We evaluate our model on both in-distribution regular-season data and out-of-distribution postseason games and compare against strong neural baselines from prior work. Despite using a single backbone model, our approach outperforms the performance of existing baselines, (1) correctly predicting approximately 64% of next pitches within a plate appearance and (2) 78% of batter swing decisions, suggesting that LLMs can serve as effective world models for sports.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u68d2\u7403\u9010\u7403\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u2014\u2014Neural Sabermetrics with World Model\uff0c\u5c06\u6bd4\u8d5b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5728\u5341\u5e74MLB\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e0b\u4e00\u6295\u7403\u548c\u51fb\u7403\u5458\u6325\u68d2\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u68d2\u7403\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\uff08sabermetrics\uff09\u64c5\u957f\u603b\u7ed3\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9010\u7403\u6a21\u62df\u6bd4\u8d5b\u52a8\u6001\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\u6216\u4e8b\u540e\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u523b\u753b\u5b8c\u6574\u6bd4\u8d5b\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u68d2\u7403\u6bd4\u8d5b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u957f\u7a0b\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e00LLM\u5728\u8d85\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MLB\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6570\u636e\uff08700\u4e07\u6b21\u6295\u7403\u300130\u4ebftoken\uff09\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u9010\u7403\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e38\u89c4\u8d5b\uff08in-distribution\uff09\u548c\u5b63\u540e\u8d5b\uff08out-of-distribution\uff09\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1a\u4e0b\u4e00\u6295\u7403\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe64%\uff0c\u51fb\u7403\u5458\u6325\u68d2\u51b3\u7b56\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe78%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4f53\u80b2\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u68d2\u7403\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u4f53\u80b2\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u3001\u591a\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Using a Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) parameterization of the Koopman operator, our method learns the temporal evolution of deformable dynamics and predicts future states through efficient matrix evaluations instead of sequential time integration. This yields log-linear scaling in the number of time steps and allows large portions of the trajectory to be skipped while retaining accuracy. The resulting temporal efficiency is especially advantageous for optimization tasks such as control and initial-state estimation, where the objective often depends largely on the final configuration.\n  To broaden the scope of Koopman-based reduced-order models in graphics, we introduce a discretization-agnostic extension that learns shared dynamic behavior across multiple shapes and mesh resolutions. Prior DMD-based approaches have been restricted to a single shape and discretization, which limits their usefulness for tasks involving geometry variation. Our formulation generalizes across both shape and discretization, which enables fast shape optimization that was previously impractical for DMD models. This expanded capability highlights the potential of Koopman operator learning as a practical tool for efficient deformable simulation and design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4e\u79e9Koopman\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u53d8\u5f62\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u62df\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u89e3\uff08DMD\uff09\u53c2\u6570\u5316Koopman\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u8de8\u5f62\u72b6/\u7f51\u683c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfDMD\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u5f62\u72b6\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u5316\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u5f62\u72b6\u4f18\u5316\uff09\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u65f6\u5e8f\u6a21\u62df\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u4e0d\u5229\u4e8e\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u521d\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b49\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ec8\u6001\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4f4e\u79e9Koopman\u7b97\u5b50\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4ee5DMD\u4e3a\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u53d8\u5f62\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5171\u4eab\u591a\u4e2a\u5f62\u72b6\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u7f51\u683c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u6570\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff08log-linear scaling\uff09\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8df3\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u4e2d\u95f4\u72b6\u6001\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0DMD\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8de8\u5f62\u72b6\u4e0e\u8de8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5f62\u72b6\u4f18\u5316\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5Koopman\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u53d8\u5f62\u4eff\u771f\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8fd8\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u964d\u9636\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u5f62\u5b66\u4e2d\u5904\u7406\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We introduce Agentic Linguistic Gossip Network (ALIGN), an automated framework where agents strategically share open-ended gossip using hierarchical tones to evaluate trustworthiness and coordinate social norms. We demonstrate that ALIGN consistently improves indirect reciprocity and resists malicious entrants by identifying and ostracizing defectors without changing intrinsic incentives. Notably, we find that stronger reasoning capabilities in LLMs lead to more incentive-aligned cooperation, whereas chat models often over-cooperate even when strategically suboptimal. These results suggest that leveraging LLM reasoning through decentralized gossip is a promising path for maintaining social welfare in agentic ecosystems.

We introduce KANLoc, a monocular localization framework that tightly couples VO with a lightweight but robust absolute pose regressor. At its core is a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) that learns the complex mapping from image features to map coordinates, producing sparse but highly reliable global pose anchors. These anchors are fused into a bundle adjustment framework, effectively canceling drift while retaining local motion precision. KANLoc delivers three key advances: (i) a KAN-based pose regressor that achieves high accuracy with remarkable parameter efficiency, (ii) a hybrid VO-absolute localization scheme that yields globally consistent real-time trajectories (>=15 FPS), and (iii) a tailored data augmentation strategy that improves robustness to sensor occlusion.

Departing from data-intensive finetuning, we investigate the paradigm of Inference-time Language Acquisition (ILA), where an LLM masters an unfamiliar language through dynamic interaction with limited external resources. In this paper, we propose ILA-agent, a general ILA framework that equips LLMs with a set of behavioral primitives. By modeling essential human-like behaviors as a suite of tools, ILA-agent enables LLMs to incrementally explore, apply, and verify language knowledge through structured interactions with the official documentation and execution environment. To provide a rigorous evaluation in a low-resource setting, we construct Cangjie-bench, a multi-task benchmark based on the novel statically-typed language Cangjie. We instantiate ILA-agent for Cangjie and evaluate its performance across code generation, translation, and program repair tasks. Results using diverse LLMs demonstrate that ILA-agent significantly outperforms retrieval-augmented baselines. Further analysis of agent trajectories characterizes the emergent behavior patterns while highlighting persisting performance gaps.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aILA-agent\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u8bed\u8a00\u4e60\u5f97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u80fd\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u6587\u6863\u548c\u6267\u884c\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u638c\u63e1\u964c\u751f\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982Cangjie\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u65e0\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u3001\u4ec5\u9760\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u8d44\u6e90\u4ea4\u4e92\u5373\u53ef\u4e60\u5f97\u65b0\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faILA-agent\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b66\u4e60\u884c\u4e3a\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\uff08\u5982\u67e5\u9605\u6587\u6863\u3001\u6267\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u4f7fLLM\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4ea4\u4e92\u9010\u6b65\u63a2\u7d22\u3001\u5e94\u7528\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b0\u8bed\u8a00\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b\u6784\u5efaCangjie-bench\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u57fa\u51c6\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b0\u9759\u6001\u7c7b\u578b\u8bed\u8a00Cangjie\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728Cangjie\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u3001\u7ffb\u8bd1\u548c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fee\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cILA-agent\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u5bf9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6d8c\u73b0\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e5f\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "conclusion": "ILA-agent\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u8bed\u8a00\u4e60\u5f97\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u5174\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u3001\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4ecd\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002"}}

Meanwhile, despite the rapid advancement of Search Agents, their practical deployment is constrained by a fundamental limitation, termed as 1) Latency Challenge: the serial execution of multi-round reasoning, tool calling, and tool response waiting under the ReAct agent paradigm induces severe end-to-end latency. Intuitively, dLLMs can leverage their distinctive strengths to optimize the operational efficiency of agents under the ReAct agent paradigm. Practically, existing dLLM backbones face the 2) Agent Ability Challenge. That is, existing dLLMs exhibit remarkably weak reasoning and tool-calling capabilities, preventing these advantages from being effectively realized in practice. In this paper, we propose DLLM-Searcher, an optimization framework for dLLM-based Search Agents. To solve the Agent Ability Challenge, we design a two-stage post-training pipeline encompassing Agentic Supervised Fine-Tuning (Agentic SFT) and Agentic Variance-Reduced Preference Optimization Agentic VRPO, which enhances the backbone dLLM's information seeking and reasoning capabilities. To mitigate the Latency Challenge, we leverage the flexible generation mechanism of dLLMs and propose a novel agent paradigm termed Parallel-Reasoning and Acting P-ReAct. P-ReAct guides the model to prioritize decoding tool_call instructions, thereby allowing the model to keep thinking while waiting for the tool's return. Experimental results demonstrate that DLLM-Searcher achieves performance comparable to mainstream LLM-based search agents and P-ReAct delivers approximately 15% inference acceleration.

Packing algorithms seek to arrange a set of charts within a fixed-size atlas with as little downscaling as possible. Many packing applications such as content creation tools, dynamic atlas generation for video games, and texture space shading require on-the-fly interactive atlas packing. Unfortunately, while many methods have been developed for generating tight high-quality packings, they are designed for offline settings and have running times two or more orders of magnitude greater than what is required for interactive performance. While real-time GPU packing methods exist, they significantly downscale packed charts compared to offline methods. We introduce a GPU packing method that targets interactive speeds, provides packing quality approaching that of offline methods, and supports flexible user control over the tradeoff between performance and quality. We observe that current real-time packing methods leave large gaps between charts and often produce asymmetric, or poorly balanced, packings. These artifacts dramatically degrade packing quality. Our Tight And Balanced method eliminates these artifacts while retaining Interactive performance. TABI generates tight packings by compacting empty space between irregularly shaped charts both horizontally and vertically, using two approximations of chart shape that support efficient parallel processing. We balance packing outputs by automatically adjusting atlas row widths and orientations to accommodate varying chart heights. We show that our method significantly reduces chart downscaling compared to existing interactive methods while remaining orders of magnitude faster than offline alternatives.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aTABI\u7684GPU\u5b9e\u65f6\u56fe\u96c6\u6253\u5305\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6253\u5305\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5feb\u901f\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u56fe\u8868\u7f29\u653e\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7d27\u51d1\u7a7a\u9699\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u8c03\u6574\u884c\u5bbd/\u671d\u5411\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6253\u5305\u7d27\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u5e73\u8861\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u79bb\u7ebf\u6253\u5305\u65b9\u6cd5\u8d28\u91cf\u9ad8\u4f46\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\u9700\u6c42\uff1b\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u5b9e\u65f6GPU\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u5feb\uff0c\u4f46\u6253\u5305\u8d28\u91cf\u5dee\uff08\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u7a7a\u9699\u3001\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff09\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u517c\u987e\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "TABI\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u56fe\u8868\u5f62\u72b6\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8868\u793a\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5e76\u884c\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u5782\u76f4\u65b9\u5411\u538b\u7f29\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u56fe\u8868\u95f4\u7684\u7a7a\u9699\u5b9e\u73b0\u7d27\u5bc6\u6253\u5305\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u81ea\u52a8\u8c03\u8282\u56fe\u96c6\u884c\u5bbd\u548c\u65b9\u5411\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7684\u56fe\u8868\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e73\u8861\u5e03\u5c40\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u5b9e\u65f6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cTABI\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u56fe\u8868\u7f29\u653e\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff1b\u76f8\u6bd4\u79bb\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e14\u6253\u5305\u66f4\u7d27\u5bc6\u3001\u66f4\u5747\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "TABI\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u6743\u8861\u7684\u56fe\u96c6\u6253\u5305\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u4e0e\u6253\u5305\u8d28\u91cf\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u77db\u76fe\u3002"}}

However, individuals are inclined to defect in order to benefit from the group's cooperation without contributing the associated costs, thus leading to unfair situations. In game theory, social dilemmas entail this dichotomy between individual interest and collective outcome. The most dominant approach to multi-agent cooperation is the utilitarian welfare which can produce efficient highly inequitable outcomes. This paper proposes a novel framework to foster fairer cooperation by replacing the standard utilitarian objective with Proportional Fairness. We introduce a fair altruistic utility for each agent, defined on the individual log-payoff space and derive the analytical conditions required to ensure cooperation in classic social dilemmas. We then extend this framework to sequential settings by defining a Fair Markov Game and deriving novel fair Actor-Critic algorithms to learn fair policies. Finally, we evaluate our method in various social dilemma environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6bd4\u4f8b\u516c\u5e73\uff08Proportional Fairness\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u529f\u5229\u4e3b\u4e49\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u793e\u4f1a\u56f0\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6570\u6536\u76ca\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u5229\u4ed6\u6548\u7528\u3001\u6784\u5efa\u516c\u5e73\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u516c\u5e73Actor-Critic\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u793e\u4f1a\u56f0\u5883\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5408\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u529f\u5229\u4e3b\u4e49\u798f\u5229\uff09\u867d\u9ad8\u6548\u4f46\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\uff1b\u800c\u4e2a\u4f53\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u80cc\u53db\u4ee5\u642d\u4fbf\u8f66\uff0c\u52a0\u5267\u793e\u4f1a\u56f0\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u516c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u517c\u987e\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6807\u51c6\u529f\u5229\u4e3b\u4e49\u76ee\u6807\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a\u6bd4\u4f8b\u516c\u5e73\u76ee\u6807\uff1b\u5b9a\u4e49\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e2a\u4f53\u5bf9\u6570\u6536\u76ca\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u5229\u4ed6\u6548\u7528\uff1b\u63a8\u5bfc\u7ecf\u5178\u793e\u4f1a\u56f0\u5883\u4e2d\u7ef4\u6301\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u516c\u5e73\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u535a\u5f08\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u578b\u516c\u5e73Actor-Critic\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u793e\u4f1a dilemma \u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u4e14\u4ecd\u5177\u5408\u4f5c\u6027\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6bd4\u4f8b\u516c\u5e73\u76ee\u6807\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u7ef4\u6301\u7fa4\u4f53\u5408\u4f5c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6bd4\u4f8b\u516c\u5e73\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u793e\u4f1a\u56f0\u5883\u4e2d\u517c\u987e\u96c6\u4f53\u5408\u4f5c\u4e0e\u4e2a\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\uff0c\u4e3a\u516c\u5e73\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}}

While other survey papers focus on the healthcare supply chain, operations, and medical emergency response aspects, this paper provides a comprehensive review of medical drones from the perspectives of flight dynamics and guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) systems. We first discuss the medical aerial delivery mission requirements and suitable uncrewed aerial system (UAS) configurations. We then address payload container design and optimization, and its effect on supplies and overall flight dynamics. We also explore the fundamental principles of GNC in the context of medical drone operations, highlighting key challenges arising from vibration, air temperature, pressure, and humidity, which affect the quality of medical supplies. The paper examines various GNC algorithms that can mitigate these challenges, as well as the algorithms' limitations.

When the underlying sources are sensitive or copyright-protected, such reproduction raises issues of consent and compensation for creators and compliance risks for developers. We propose Anchored Decoding, a plug-and-play inference-time method for suppressing verbatim copying: it enables decoding from any risky LM trained on mixed-license data by keeping generation in bounded proximity to a permissively trained safe LM. Anchored Decoding adaptively allocates a user-chosen information budget over the generation trajectory and enforces per-step constraints that yield a sequence-level guarantee, enabling a tunable risk-utility trade-off. To make Anchored Decoding practically useful, we introduce a new permissively trained safe model (TinyComma 1.8B), as well as Anchored$_{\\mathrm{Byte}}$ Decoding, a byte-level variant of our method that enables cross-vocabulary fusion via the ByteSampler framework (Hayase et al., 2025). We evaluate our methods across six model pairs on long-form evaluations of copyright risk and utility. Anchored and Anchored$_{\\mathrm{Byte}}$ Decoding define a new Pareto frontier, preserving near-original fluency and factuality while eliminating up to 75% of the measurable copying gap (averaged over six copying metrics) between the risky baseline and a safe reference, at a modest inference overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aAnchored Decoding\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6291\u5236\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9010\u5b57\u590d\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u951a\u5b9a\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6a21\u578b\u9644\u8fd1\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4fe1\u606f\u9884\u7b97\u4e0e\u9010\u6b65\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u98ce\u9669-\u6548\u7528\u7684\u53ef\u8c03\u6743\u8861\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u6a21\u578bTinyComma 1.8B\u53ca\u5b57\u8282\u7ea7\u53d8\u4f53Anchored$_{\\mathrm{Byte}}$ Decoding\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6284\u88ad\u7387\uff08\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe75%\uff09\uff0c\u4ec5\u5e26\u6765\u8f7b\u5fae\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6613\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e76\u590d\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6216\u53d7\u7248\u6743\u4fdd\u62a4\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\u6743\u76ca\u3001\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u4e0e\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u8d23\u4efb\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAnchored Decoding\uff1a\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5c06\u98ce\u9669\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u951a\u5b9a\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e2a\u5bbd\u677e\u8bb8\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982TinyComma 1.8B\uff09\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u914d\u7528\u6237\u8bbe\u5b9a\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u5e76\u65bd\u52a0\u9010\u6b65\u7ea6\u675f\u4ee5\u4fdd\u969c\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u51fa\u5b57\u8282\u7ea7\u53d8\u4f53Anchored$_{\\mathrm{Byte}}$ Decoding\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408ByteSampler\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u8bcd\u8868\u878d\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u548c\u957f\u6587\u672c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u63a5\u8fd1\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u4e0e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u964d\u4f4e75%\u7684\u53ef\u6d4b\u6284\u88ad\u5dee\u8ddd\uff08\u516d\u9879\u6284\u88ad\u6307\u6807\uff09\uff0c\u4ec5\u5f15\u5165\u9002\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "Anchored Decoding\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u8c03\u3001\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u969c\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u9632\u6284\u88ad\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u98ce\u9669\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u65b0Pareto\u524d\u6cbf\uff0c\u4e3a\u6df7\u5408\u6388\u6743\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We present RetSAM, a general retinal segmentation and quantification framework for fundus imaging. It delivers robust multi-target segmentation and standardized biomarker extraction, supporting downstream ophthalmologic studies and oculomics correlation analyses. Trained on over 200,000 fundus images, RetSAM supports three task categories and segments five anatomical structures, four retinal phenotypic patterns, and more than 20 distinct lesion types. It converts these segmentation results into over 30 standardized biomarkers that capture structural morphology, vascular geometry, and degenerative changes. Trained with a multi-stage strategy using both private and public fundus data, RetSAM achieves superior segmentation performance on 17 public datasets. It improves on prior best methods by 3.9 percentage points in DSC on average, with up to 15 percentage points on challenging multi-task benchmarks, and generalizes well across diverse populations, imaging devices, and clinical settings. The resulting biomarkers enable systematic correlation analyses across major ophthalmic diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, and pathologic myopia.

Generative AI has shown promise in increasing data volume and enhancing model training, particularly in computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) domains. However, generating physiological time-series data, a common type in medical AI applications, presents unique challenges due to its inherent complexity and variability. This paper introduces TransConv-DDPM, an enhanced generative AI method for biomechanical and physiological time-series data generation. The model employs a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) with U-Net, multi-scale convolution modules, and a transformer layer to capture both global and local temporal dependencies. We evaluated TransConv-DDPM on three diverse datasets, generating both long and short-sequence time-series data. Quantitative comparisons against state-of-the-art methods, TimeGAN and Diffusion-TS, using four performance metrics, demonstrated promising results, particularly on the SmartFallMM and EEG datasets, where it effectively captured the more gradual temporal change patterns between data points. Additionally, a utility test on the SmartFallMM dataset revealed that adding synthetic fall data generated by TransConv-DDPM improved predictive model performance, showing a 13.64% improvement in F1-score and a 14.93% increase in overall accuracy compared to the baseline model trained solely on fall data from the SmartFallMM dataset.

Standard MPM practices suffer from a performance bottleneck where expensive implicit solves are proportional to particle-per-cell (PPC) counts due to the the choices of particle-based quadrature and wide-stencil kernels. In contrast, MPM Lite treats particles primarily as carriers of kinematic state and material history. By conceptualizing the background Cartesian grid as a voxel hexahedral mesh, we resample particle states onto fixed-location quadrature points using efficient, compact linear kernels. This architectural shift allows force assembly and the entire time-integration process to proceed without accessing particles, making the solver complexity no longer relate to particles. At the core of our method is a novel stress transfer and stretch reconstruction strategy. To avoid non-physical averaging of deformation gradients, we resample the extensive Kirchhoff stress and derive a rotation-free deformation reference solution, which naturally supports an optimization-based incremental potential formulation. Consequently, MPM Lite can be implemented as modular resampling units coupled with an FEM-style integration module, enabling the direct use of off-the-shelf nonlinear solvers, preconditioners, and unambiguous boundary conditions. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that MPM Lite preserves the robustness and versatility of traditional MPM across diverse materials while delivering significant speedups in implicit settings and improving explicit settings at the same time.

Current governance approaches suffer from inherent latency and static policies, struggling to counter coordinated adversarial amplification that evolves in real-time. We present EvoCorps, an evolutionary multi-agent framework for proactive depolarization. EvoCorps frames discourse governance as a dynamic social game and coordinates roles for monitoring, planning, grounded generation, and multi-identity diffusion. A retrieval-augmented collective cognition core provides factual grounding and action--outcome memory, while closed-loop evolutionary learning adapts strategies as the environment and attackers change. We implement EvoCorps on the MOSAIC social-AI simulation platform for controlled evaluation in a multi-source news stream with adversarial injection and amplification. Across emotional polarization, viewpoint extremity, and argumentative rationality, EvoCorps improves discourse outcomes over an adversarial baseline, pointing to a practical path from detection and post-hoc mitigation to in-process, closed-loop intervention.

Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research", "summary": "As hardware and software systems have grown in complexity, formal methods have been indispensable tools for rigorously specifying acceptable behaviors, synthesizing programs to meet these specifications, and validating the correctness of existing programs. In the field of robotics, a similar trend of rising complexity has emerged, driven in large part by the adoption of deep learning. While this shift has enabled the development of highly performant robot policies, their implementation as deep neural networks has posed challenges to traditional formal analysis, leading to models that are inflexible, fragile, and difficult to interpret. In response, the robotics community has introduced new formal and semi-formal methods to support the precise specification of complex objectives, guide the learning process to achieve them, and enable the verification of learned policies against them. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of how formal methods have been used in recent robot learning research. We organize our discussion around two pillars: policy learning and policy verification. For both, we highlight representative techniques, compare their scalability and expressiveness, and summarize how they contribute to meaningfully improving realistic robot safety and correctness. We conclude with a discussion of remaining obstacles for achieving that goal and promising directions for advancing formal methods in robot learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u56f4\u7ed5\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e24\u5927\u652f\u67f1\u5c55\u5f00\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u53ca\u672a\u6765\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u590d\u6742\u6027\u589e\u52a0\u53ca\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0d\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3001\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u65b0\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6216\u534a\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u590d\u6742\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u68b3\u7406\u8fd1\u5e74\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u6309\u2018\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u2019\u548c\u2018\u7b56\u7565\u9a8c\u8bc1\u2019\u4e24\u5927\u4e3b\u9898\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5404\u7c7b\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "\u5f52\u7eb3\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5df2\u652f\u6491\u591a\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u5982\u7ea6\u675f\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u903b\u8f91\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u76d1\u63a7\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff1b\u4f46\u4ecd\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u9002\u914d\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6b63\u6210\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u878d\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u52a8\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u534f\u540c\u6f14\u8fdb\u3002"}}

We propose the Free Energy Mixer (FEM): a free-energy (log-sum-exp) read that applies a value-driven, per-channel log-linear tilt to a fast prior (e.g., from queries/keys in standard attention) over indices. Unlike methods that attempt to improve and enrich the $(q,k)$ scoring distribution, FEM treats it as a prior and yields a value-aware posterior read at unchanged complexity, smoothly moving from averaging to per-channel selection as the learnable inverse temperature increases, while still preserving parallelism and the original asymptotic complexity ($O(T^2)$ for softmax; $O(T)$ for linearizable variants). We instantiate a two-level gated FEM that is plug-and-play with standard and linear attention, linear RNNs and SSMs. It consistently outperforms strong baselines on NLP, vision, and time-series at matched parameter budgets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aFree Energy Mixer (FEM)\u7684\u65b0\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8bfb\u53d6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\uff08log-sum-exp\uff09\u64cd\u4f5c\u5b9e\u73b0\u503c\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u901a\u9053\u7ea7\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u5e76\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u539f\u6709\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u867d\u65e0\u635f\u5b58\u50a8\u952e/\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6bcf\u5934\u51f8\u5e73\u5747\u8bfb\u53d6\u65b9\u5f0f\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u901a\u9053\u7ea7\u9009\u62e9\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5efa\u6a21\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFEM\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u67e5\u8be2/\u952e\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u5148\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9006\u6e29\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u503c\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9010\u901a\u9053log-linear\u503e\u659c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\u8bfb\u53d6\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e24\u7ea7\u95e8\u63a7FEM\uff0c\u517c\u5bb9\u6807\u51c6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u3001\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u3001\u7ebf\u6027RNN\u53caSSM\u3002", "result": "\u5728NLP\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "FEM\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u503c\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8bfb\u53d6\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

While multimodal foundation models excel at passive perception, their capacity for active, self-directed exploration remains understudied. We propose Theory of Space, defined as an agent's ability to actively acquire information through self-directed, active exploration and to construct, revise, and exploit a spatial belief from sequential, partial observations. We evaluate this through a benchmark where the goal is curiosity-driven exploration to build an accurate cognitive map. A key innovation is spatial belief probing, which prompts models to reveal their internal spatial representations at each step. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals several critical bottlenecks. First, we identify an Active-Passive Gap, where performance drops significantly when agents must autonomously gather information. Second, we find high inefficiency, as models explore unsystematically compared to program-based proxies. Through belief probing, we diagnose that while perception is an initial bottleneck, global beliefs suffer from instability that causes spatial knowledge to degrade over time. Finally, using a false belief paradigm, we uncover Belief Inertia, where agents fail to update obsolete priors with new evidence. This issue is present in text-based agents but is particularly severe in vision-based models. Our findings suggest that current foundation models struggle to maintain coherent, revisable spatial beliefs during active exploration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u201c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u8bba\u201d\uff0c\u5373\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a2\u7d22\u6784\u5efa\u3001\u4fee\u6b63\u548c\u5229\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u5ff5\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u597d\u5947\u5fc3\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u5730\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u51c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a2\u7d22\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e3b\u52a8-\u88ab\u52a8\u5dee\u8ddd\u3001\u4f4e\u6548\u6027\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ca\u4fe1\u5ff5\u60ef\u6027\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u64c5\u957f\u88ab\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u4e3b\u4e3b\u52a8\u83b7\u53d6\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u5ff5\u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u66f4\u65b0\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTheory of Space\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u597d\u5947\u5fc3\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u5ff5\u63a2\u6d4b\uff08spatial belief probing\uff09\u6280\u672f\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u6bcf\u6b65\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u5ff5\u8303\u5f0f\u8bca\u65ad\u4fe1\u5ff5\u66f4\u65b0\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u56db\u5927\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u4e3b\u52a8-\u88ab\u52a8\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u3001\u63a2\u7d22\u4f4e\u6548\u6027\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u5ff5\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u9000\u5316\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u60ef\u6027\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a2\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7ef4\u6301\u8fde\u8d2f\u3001\u53ef\u4fee\u6b63\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u5ff5\uff0c\u9700\u5728\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5236\u4e0a\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

Although recent multimodal large language models have shown strong performance on this task, two key challenges remain - spurious associations between emotions and irrelevant audiovisual cues, and hallucinations of audiovisual cues driven by text priors in the language model backbone. To quantify and understand these issues, we introduce EmoReAlM, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs for cue-emotion associations, hallucinations and modality agreement. We then propose AVEm-DPO, a preference optimization technique that aligns model responses with both audiovisual inputs and emotion-centric queries. Specifically, we construct preferences over responses exhibiting spurious associations or hallucinations, and audiovisual input pairs guided by textual prompts. We also include a regularization term that penalizes reliance on text priors, thereby mitigating modality-specific cue hallucinations. Experimental results on DFEW, RAVDESS and EMER demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of the reference baseline models with 6-19% of relative performance gains in zero-shot settings.

In graphics, numerical integrators like implicit Euler and BDF2 are preferred due to their stability at large time steps, but they tend to dissipate energy uncontrollably. In contrast, symplectic methods like implicit midpoint can conserve energy but are not unconditionally stable and fail on moderately stiff problems. To address these limitations, we propose a general class of numerical integrators for Hamiltonian problems which are symplectic on linear problems, yet have superior stability on nonlinear problems. With this, we derive a novel energy-controllable time integrator, A-search, a simple modification of implicit Euler that can follow user-specified energy targets, enabling flexible control over energy dissipation or conservation while maintaining stability and physical fidelity. Our method integrates seamlessly with barrier-type energies and allows for inversion-free and penetration-free guarantees, making it well-suited for handling large deformations and complex collisions. Extensive evaluations over a wide range of material parameters and scenes demonstrate that A-search has biases to keep energy in low frequency motion rather than dissipation, and A-search outperforms traditional methods such as BDF2 at similar total running times by maintaining energy and leading to more visually desirable simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u80fd\u91cf\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u79ef\u5206\u5668A-search\uff0c\u5b83\u662f\u9690\u5f0f\u6b27\u62c9\u6cd5\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6309\u7528\u6237\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u91cf\u8017\u6563\u6216\u5b88\u6052\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9690\u5f0f\u79ef\u5206\u5668\uff08\u5982\u9690\u5f0f\u6b27\u62c9\u3001BDF2\uff09\u867d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f46\u8fc7\u5ea6\u8017\u6563\u80fd\u91cf\uff1b\u8f9b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u9690\u5f0f\u4e2d\u70b9\u6cd5\uff09\u53ef\u4fdd\u80fd\u91cf\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u521a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u7c7b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6570\u503c\u79ef\u5206\u5668\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u8f9b\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u5177\u5907\u66f4\u4f18\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5bfc\u51faA-search\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u53c2\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u80fd\u91cf\u76ee\u6807\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u65e0\u53cd\u8f6c\u3001\u65e0\u7a7f\u900f\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "A-search\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6750\u6599\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9\u4f4e\u9891\u8fd0\u52a8\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u4fdd\u7559\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4BDF2\u7b49\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u8fd1\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0b\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u7ef4\u6301\u80fd\u91cf\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u671f\u671b\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "A-search\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u80fd\u91cf\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u53d8\u5f62\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u78b0\u649e\u7684\u5f39\u6027\u4f53\u52a8\u6001\u4eff\u771f\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we propose a unified \\textbf{M}ulti-\\textbf{D}istribution \\textbf{L}earning (MDL) framework, inspired by the \"prompting\" paradigm in large language models (LLMs). MDL treats scenario and task information as specialized tokens rather than auxiliary inputs or gating signals. Specifically, we introduce a unified information tokenization module that transforms features, scenarios, and tasks into a unified tokenized format. To facilitate deep interaction, we design three synergistic mechanisms: (1) feature token self-attention for rich feature interactions, (2) domain-feature attention for scenario/task-adaptive feature activation, and (3) domain-fused aggregation for joint distribution prediction. By stacking these interactions, MDL enables scenario and task information to \"prompt\" and activate the model's vast parameter space in a bottom-up, layer-wise manner. Extensive experiments on real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that MDL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MSL and MTL baselines.

While value alignment is typically evaluated for isolated models, how value perturbations propagate through agent interactions remains poorly understood. We present ValueFlow, a perturbation-based evaluation framework for measuring and analyzing value drift in multi-agent systems. ValueFlow introduces a 56-value evaluation dataset derived from the Schwartz Value Survey and quantifies agents' value orientations during interaction using an LLM-as-a-judge protocol. Building on this measurement layer, ValueFlow decomposes value drift into agent-level response behavior and system-level structural effects, operationalized by two metrics: beta-susceptibility, which measures an agent's sensitivity to perturbed peer signals, and system susceptibility (SS), which captures how node-level perturbations affect final system outputs. Experiments across multiple model backbones, prompt personas, value dimensions, and network structures show that susceptibility varies widely across values and is strongly shaped by structural topology.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ValueFlow\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6270\u52a8\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u4ef7\u503c\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fabeta-susceptibility\u548csystem susceptibility\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u6765\u5206\u522b\u523b\u753b\u4e2a\u4f53\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u5bf9\u9f50\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u4e2a\u5b64\u7acb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4ef7\u503c\u6270\u52a8\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f20\u64ad\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8eSchwartz\u4ef7\u503c\u8c03\u67e5\u768456\u7ef4\u4ef7\u503c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528LLM-as-a-judge\u534f\u8bae\u91cf\u5316\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u53d6\u5411\uff1b\u5b9a\u4e49beta-susceptibility\u548csystem susceptibility\u4e24\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u8861\u91cf\u4e2a\u4f53\u5bf9\u540c\u4f34\u6270\u52a8\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u53ca\u8282\u70b9\u6270\u52a8\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e0d\u540c\u4ef7\u503c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4e14\u7ed3\u6784\u62d3\u6251\u5bf9\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u70c8\u5851\u9020\u4f5c\u7528\uff1b\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u63d0\u793a\u89d2\u8272\u3001\u4ef7\u503c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ValueFlow\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u91cf\u5316\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u6f02\u79fb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u53ef\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u56e0\u7d20\u5728\u4ef7\u503c\u4f20\u64ad\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

In unseen, unmapped, or GPS-denied settings, traditional metric map-based methods fall short, prompting a shift toward learning-based approaches with minimal exploration. In this work, we develop a hierarchical framework that decomposes the navigation decision-making process into multiple levels. Our method learns to select subgoals through a simple, transferable waypoint selection network. A key component of the approach is a latent-space memory module organized solely by visual similarity, as a proxy for distance. This alternative to graph-based topological representations proves sufficient for navigation tasks, providing a compact, light-weight, simple-to-train navigator that can find its way to the goal in novel locations. We show competitive results with a suite of SOTA methods in Habitat AI environments without using any odometry in training or inference.

Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate a similar flexibility in adopting different personas and behaviors. Existing approaches, however, typically adapt such behavior through external knowledge such as prompting, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), or fine-tuning. We ask: do LLMs really need external context or parameters to adapt to different behaviors, or do they already have such knowledge embedded in their parameters? In this work, we show that LLMs already contain persona-specialized subnetworks in their parameter space. Using small calibration datasets, we identify distinct activation signatures associated with different personas. Guided by these statistics, we develop a masking strategy that isolates lightweight persona subnetworks. Building on the findings, we further discuss: how can we discover opposing subnetwork from the model that lead to binary-opposing personas, such as introvert-extrovert? To further enhance separation in binary opposition scenarios, we introduce a contrastive pruning strategy that identifies parameters responsible for the statistical divergence between opposing personas. Our method is entirely training-free and relies solely on the language model's existing parameter space. Across diverse evaluation settings, the resulting subnetworks exhibit significantly stronger persona alignment than baselines that require external knowledge while being more efficient. Our findings suggest that diverse human-like behaviors are not merely induced in LLMs, but are already embedded in their parameter space, pointing toward a new perspective on controllable and interpretable personalization in large language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u53c2\u6570\u4e2d\u5df2\u5185\u5d4c\u591a\u79cd\u4eba\u683c\u4e13\u5c5e\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u5206\u79bb\u5e76\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5bf9\u5e94\u4eba\u683c\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4eba\u683c\u5bf9\u9f50\u6548\u679c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76LLM\u662f\u5426\u771f\u7684\u9700\u8981\u5916\u90e8\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\u6765\u9002\u914d\u4e0d\u540c\u4eba\u683c\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u5176\u53c2\u6570\u4e2d\u5df2\u5929\u7136\u5d4c\u5165\u4e86\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4eba\u683c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u6821\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u540c\u4eba\u683c\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63a9\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4eba\u683c\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\uff1b\u9488\u5bf9\u4e8c\u5143\u5bf9\u7acb\u4eba\u683c\uff08\u5982\u5185\u5411-\u5916\u5411\uff09\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5bf9\u6bd4\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7b5b\u9009\u5bfc\u81f4\u7edf\u8ba1\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u5168\u8fc7\u7a0b\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ec5\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u539f\u6709\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u83b7\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u591a\u573a\u666f\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4e2d\u4eba\u683c\u5bf9\u9f50\u80fd\u529b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\uff1b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86LLM\u53c2\u6570\u4e2d\u5df2\u5b58\u5728\u7c7b\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u683c\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u5e76\u975e\u5b8c\u5168\u7531\u5916\u90e8\u8bf1\u5bfc\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u9884\u5148\u7f16\u7801\u4e8e\u53c2\u6570\u4e4b\u4e2d\uff1b\u8be5\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

When facing context-dense product imagery and multimodal defects, current reference-based methods (e.g., SSIM, FID) lack explainability, while model-as-judge approaches lack domain-grounded, fine-grained reward signals. To bridge this gap, we introduce Vectra, to the best of our knowledge, the first reference-free, MLLM-driven visual quality assessment framework for e-commerce IIMT. Vectra comprises three components: (1) Vectra Score, a multidimensional quality metric system that decomposes visual quality into 14 interpretable dimensions, with spatially-aware Defect Area Ratio (DAR) quantification to reduce annotation ambiguity; (2) Vectra Dataset, constructed from 1.1M real-world product images via diversity-aware sampling, comprising a 2K benchmark for system evaluation, 30K reasoning-based annotations for instruction tuning, and 3.5K expert-labeled preferences for alignment and evaluation; and (3) Vectra Model, a 4B-parameter MLLM that generates both quantitative scores and diagnostic reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that Vectra achieves state-of-the-art correlation with human rankings, and our model outperforms leading MLLMs, including GPT-5 and Gemini-3, in scoring performance.

We present a trajectory expansion framework Anchor that bootstraps scalable desktop supervision from a small set of verified seed demonstrations. Starting from each seed, we identify branch points that correspond to meaningful state changes and propose new, state-grounded task variants conditioned on the current GUI context. An executing agent then follows the proposed instructions to generate new trajectories, while a verifier enforces task completion via state-aware checks and trajectory-level consistency. To improve supervision quality, we further apply task-conditioned step-level filtering to remove ungrounded actions and denoise post-branch segments to maintain coherent intent.

Unlike language-based reasoning systems, TACIT operates entirely in pixel space using rectified flow, enabling direct visualization of the reasoning process at each inference step.

Key results on 1 million synthetic maze pairs include:\n  - 192x reduction in training loss over 100 epochs\n  - 22.7x improvement in L2 distance to ground truth\n  - Only 10 Euler steps required (vs. 100-1000 for typical diffusion models)\n  Quantitative analysis reveals a striking phase transition phenomenon: the solution remains invisible for 68% of the transformation (zero recall), then emerges abruptly at t=0.70 within just 2% of the process. Most remarkably, 100% of samples exhibit simultaneous emergence across all spatial regions, ruling out sequential path construction and providing evidence for holistic rather than algorithmic reasoning.

While super-resolution is widely used in production, it uniformly sacrifices spatial detail and cannot exploit variations in noise, reconstruction difficulty, and perceptual importance across the image. Adaptive sampling offers a compelling alternative, but existing end-to-end approaches rely on approximations that break down in sparse regimes.\n  We introduce an end-to-end adaptive sampling and denoising pipeline explicitly designed for the sub-1-spp regime. Our method uses a stochastic formulation of sample placement that enables gradient estimation despite discrete sampling decisions, allowing stable training of a neural sampler at low sampling budgets. To better align optimization with human perception, we propose a tonemapping-aware training pipeline that integrates differentiable filmic operators and a state-of-the-art perceptual loss, preventing oversampling of regions with low visual impact.\n  In addition, we introduce a gather-based pyramidal denoising filter and a learnable generalization of albedo demodulation tailored to sparse sampling.

To strengthen cross-text associations, recent research integrates graphs and hypergraphs into RAG to capture pairwise and multi-entity relations as structured links. However, their misaligned memory organization necessitates costly, disjointed retrieval. To address these limitations, we propose IGMiRAG, a framework inspired by human intuition-guided reasoning. It constructs a hierarchical heterogeneous hypergraph to align multi-granular knowledge, incorporating deductive pathways to simulate realistic memory structures. During querying, IGMiRAG distills intuitive strategies via a question parser to control mining depth and memory window, and activates instantaneous memories as anchors using dual-focus retrieval. Mirroring human intuition, the framework guides retrieval resource allocation dynamically.

Existing methods often ensure convergence to (approximate) Nash equilibria by introducing a form of regularization. Yet, regularization requires additional hyperparameters, which must be carefully tuned--a challenging task when the payoff structure is known, and considerably harder when the structure is unknown or subject to change. Motivated by this problem, we repurpose a classical model in evolutionary game theory, i.e., the Brown-von Neumann-Nash (BNN) dynamics, by leveraging the intrinsic convergence of this dynamics in zero-sum games without regularization, and provide last-iterate convergence guarantees in noisy normal-form games (NFGs). Importantly, to make this approach more applicable, we develop a novel framework with theoretical guarantees that integrates the BNN dynamics in extensive-form games (EFGs) through counterfactual weighting. Furthermore, we implement an algorithm that instantiates our framework with neural function approximation, enabling scalable learning in both NFGs and EFGs. Empirical results show that our method quickly adapts to nonstationarities, outperforming the state-of-the-art regularization-based approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eBrown-von Neumann-Nash\uff08BNN\uff09\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u65e0\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u96f6\u548c\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u6b63\u89c4\u578b\u4e0e\u6269\u5c55\u578b\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u540e\u8fed\u4ee3\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u52a0\u6743\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u51fd\u6570\u903c\u8fd1\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u96f6\u548c\u535a\u5f08\u6c42\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9700\u7cbe\u7ec6\u8c03\u53c2\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u652f\u4ed8\u7ed3\u6784\u672a\u77e5\u6216\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u66f4\u96be\uff1b\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65e0\u9700\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3001\u5177\u5185\u5728\u6536\u655b\u6027\u4e14\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u590d\u7528\u5e76\u6539\u8fdbBNN\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u5e26\u566a\u58f0\u6b63\u89c4\u578b\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u5177\u6700\u540e\u8fed\u4ee3\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u52a0\u6743\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u5176\u62d3\u5c55\u81f3\u6269\u5c55\u578b\u535a\u5f08\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u51fd\u6570\u903c\u8fd1\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6b63\u89c4\u578b\u4e0e\u6269\u5c55\u578b\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u6700\u540e\u8fed\u4ee3\u6536\u655b\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "BNN\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3001\u5177\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u96f6\u548c\u535a\u5f08\u6c42\u89e3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u6b63\u89c4\u578b\u4e0e\u6269\u5c55\u578b\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u7684\u6210\u529f\u62d3\u5c55\u4e3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7406\u8bba\u5de5\u5177\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Sliding Mode Control (SMC) has emerged as a robust approach for managing uncertainties and disturbances in manipulator dynamics, providing superior control performance compared to traditional methods. This study implements a model-based SMC (MBSMC) utilizing a hyperbolic tangent function to regulate the motion of a manipulator mounted on a mobile platform operating inside a self-driving chemical laboratory. Given the manipulator's role in transporting fragile glass vessels filled with hazardous chemicals, the controller is specifically designed to minimize abrupt transitions and achieve gentle, accurate trajectory tracking. The proposed controller is benchmarked against a non-model-based SMC (NMBSMC) and a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller using a comprehensive set of joint and Cartesian metrics. Compared to PID and NMBSMC, MBSMC achieved significantly smoother motion and up to 90% lower control effort, validating its robustness and precision for autonomous laboratory operations. Experimental trials confirmed successful execution of tasks such as vessel grasping and window operation, which failed under PID control due to its limited ability to handle nonlinear dynamics and external disturbances, resulting in substantial trajectory tracking errors. The results validate the controller's effectiveness in achieving smooth, precise, and safe manipulator motions, supporting the advancement of intelligent mobile manipulators in autonomous laboratory environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6ed1\u6a21\u63a7\u5236\uff08MBSMC\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u9a71\u52a8\u5316\u5b66\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u4e2d\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u3001\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u8017\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfPID\u548c\u975e\u6a21\u578b\u6ed1\u6a21\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u81ea\u9a71\u52a8\u5316\u5b66\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u4e2d\uff0c\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u9700\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u7cbe\u51c6\u5730\u64cd\u4f5c\u6613\u788e\u73bb\u7483\u5668\u76bf\u548c\u5371\u9669\u5316\u5b66\u54c1\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff08\u5982PID\uff09\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8f68\u8ff9\u8bef\u5dee\u5927\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e0d\u5e73\u7a33\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6ed1\u6a21\u63a7\u5236\uff08MBSMC\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u66f2\u6b63\u5207\u51fd\u6570\u524a\u5f31\u6296\u632f\uff1b\u4ee5\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u4e3a\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u9762\u5411\u5173\u8282\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u7b1b\u5361\u5c14\u7a7a\u95f4\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fc7\u6e21\u4e0e\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4PID\u548c\u975e\u6a21\u578b\u6ed1\u6a21\u63a7\u5236\uff08NMBSMC\uff09\uff0cMBSMC\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u8fbe90%\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6210\u529f\u5b8c\u6210\u6293\u53d6\u5668\u76bf\u3001\u5f00\u5173\u7a97\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u800cPID\u56e0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "conclusion": "MBSMC\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u4e3b\u5316\u5b66\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u4e2d\u667a\u80fd\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

However, existing educational chatbot systems often lack contextual adaptability, real-time responsiveness, and pedagogical agility. which can limit learner engagement and diminish instructional effectiveness. Thus, there is a growing need for open, integrative platforms that combine AI and immersive technologies to support personalized, meaningful learning experiences. This paper presents Open TutorAI, an open-source educational platform based on LLMs and generative technologies that provides dynamic, personalized tutoring. The system integrates natural language processing with customizable 3D avatars to enable multimodal learner interaction. Through a structured onboarding process, it captures each learner's goals and preferences in order to configure a learner-specific AI assistant. This assistant is accessible via both text-based and avatar-driven interfaces. The platform includes tools for organizing content, providing embedded feedback, and offering dedicated interfaces for learners, educators, and parents. This work focuses on learner-facing components, delivering a tool for adaptive support that responds to individual learner profiles without requiring technical expertise. Its assistant-generation pipeline and avatar integration enhance engagement and emotional presence, creating a more humanized, immersive learning environment.

However, existing reflective approaches are inherently retrospective: agents act, observe failure, and only then attempt to recover. In this work, we introduce PreFlect, a prospective reflection mechanism that shifts the paradigm from post hoc correction to pre-execution foresight by criticizing and refining agent plans before execution. To support grounded prospective reflection, we distill planning errors from historical agent trajectories, capturing recurring success and failure patterns observed across past executions. Furthermore, we complement prospective reflection with a dynamic re-planning mechanism that provides execution-time plan update in case the original plan encounters unexpected deviation. Evaluations on different benchmarks demonstrate that PreFlect significantly improves overall agent utility on complex real-world tasks, outperforming strong reflection-based baselines and several more complex agent architectures.

Project page: https://lhyfst.github.io/balancehead/", "summary": "Conditioning is crucial for stable training of full-head 3D GANs. Without any conditioning signal, the model suffers from severe mode collapse, making it impractical to training. However, a series of previous full-head 3D GANs conventionally choose the view angle as the conditioning input, which leads to a bias in the learned 3D full-head space along the conditional view direction. This is evident in the significant differences in generation quality and diversity between the conditional view and non-conditional views of the generated 3D heads, resulting in global incoherence across different head regions. In this work, we propose to use view-invariant semantic feature as the conditioning input, thereby decoupling the generative capability of 3D heads from the viewing direction. To construct a view-invariant semantic condition for each training image, we create a novel synthesized head image dataset. We leverage FLUX.1 Kontext to extend existing high-quality frontal face datasets to a wide range of view angles. The image clip feature extracted from the frontal view is then used as a shared semantic condition across all views in the extended images, ensuring semantic alignment while eliminating directional bias. This also allows supervision from different views of the same subject to be consolidated under a shared semantic condition, which accelerates training and enhances the global coherence of the generated 3D heads. Moreover, as GANs often experience slower improvements in diversity once the generator learns a few modes that successfully fool the discriminator, our semantic conditioning encourages the generator to follow the true semantic distribution, thereby promoting continuous learning and diverse generation. Extensive experiments on full-head synthesis and single-view GAN inversion demonstrate that our method achieves significantly higher fidelity, diversity, and generalizability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0d\u53d8\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u8f93\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u5168\u59343D GAN\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u89d2\u89d2\u6761\u4ef6\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5168\u59343D GAN\u4f7f\u7528\u89c6\u89d2\u89d2\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f43D\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b66\u4e60\u5b58\u5728\u65b9\u5411\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u5168\u5c40\u4e0d\u8fde\u8d2f\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6613\u53d1\u751f\u4e25\u91cd\u6a21\u5f0f\u574d\u584c\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u524d\u89c6\u56feCLIP\u7279\u5f81\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u5408\u6210\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u5934\u90e8\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5229\u7528FLUX.1 Kontext\u6269\u5c55\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u524d\u8138\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u540c\u4e00\u4e3b\u4f53\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\u5171\u4eab\u540c\u4e00\u8bed\u4e49\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b\u8be5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89e3\u8026\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u76d1\u7763\u6574\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5168\u5934\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u5355\u89c6\u56feGAN\u53cd\u6f14\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0d\u53d8\u8bed\u4e49\u6761\u4ef6\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u89c6\u89d2\u6761\u4ef6\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e863D\u5934\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5168\u59343D\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u66f4\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u5efa\u6a21\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Existing approaches often incur substantial computational overhead, making them difficult to deploy in large-scale industrial systems under strict latency constraints. Recent sparse activation scaling methods, such as Sparse Mixture-of-Experts, reduce computation by activating only a subset of parameters, but still suffer from high memory access costs and limited personalization capacity due to the large size and small number of experts. To address these challenges, we propose MSN, a memory-based sparse activation scaling framework for recommendation models. MSN dynamically retrieves personalized representations from a large parameterized memory and integrates them into downstream feature interaction modules via a memory gating mechanism, enabling fine-grained personalization with low computational overhead. To enable further expansion of the memory capacity while keeping both computational and memory access costs under control, MSN adopts a Product-Key Memory (PKM) mechanism, which factorizes the memory retrieval complexity from linear time to sub-linear complexity. In addition, normalization and over-parameterization techniques are introduced to maintain balanced memory utilization and prevent memory retrieval collapse. We further design customized Sparse-Gather operator and adopt the AirTopK operator to improve training and inference efficiency in industrial settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MSN consistently improves recommendation performance while maintaining high efficiency. Moreover, MSN has been successfully deployed in the Douyin Search Ranking System, achieving significant gains over deployed state-of-the-art models in both offline evaluation metrics and large-scale online A/B test.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMSN\uff08Memory-based Sparse activation scaling framework\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6269\u5c55\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u63a7\u5236\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8868\u5f81\u3001\u5f15\u5165Product-Key Memory\u964d\u4f4e\u68c0\u7d22\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u3001\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u53ca\u5b9a\u5236\u7b97\u5b50\u4f18\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0cMSN\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5df2\u6210\u529f\u90e8\u7f72\u4e8e\u6296\u97f3\u641c\u7d22\u6392\u5e8f\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8981\u6c42\uff1b\u7a00\u758f\u6fc0\u6d3b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982MoE\uff09\u867d\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4f46\u5185\u5b58\u8bbf\u95ee\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u4e13\u5bb6\u6570\u91cf\u5c11\u4e14\u89c4\u6a21\u5927\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMSN\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u5bb9\u91cf\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u8bb0\u5fc6\u52a8\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8868\u5f81\uff1b2\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bb0\u5fc6\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u878d\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1b3\uff09\u91c7\u7528Product-Key Memory\uff08PKM\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e9a\u7ebf\u6027\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u68c0\u7d22\uff1b4\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u4e0e\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u9632\u6b62\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5229\u7528\u5931\u8861\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\u5d29\u6e83\uff1b5\uff09\u5b9a\u5236Sparse-Gather\u4e0eAirTopK\u7b97\u5b50\u63d0\u5347\u5de5\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3/\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0aMSn\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u5df2\u5728\u6296\u97f3\u641c\u7d22\u6392\u5e8f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u7ebf\uff0c\u79bb\u7ebf\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7ebf\u4e0aA/B\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524dSOTA\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "MSN\u901a\u8fc7\u8bb0\u5fc6\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6fc0\u6d3b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u969c\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Prior work has explored correlating local policies via shared randomness, sometimes in the form of a correlation device, as a mechanism to assist in decentralized decision-making. In contrast, this work introduces the first framework for training MARL agents to exploit shared quantum entanglement as a coordination resource, which permits a larger class of communication-free correlated policies than shared randomness alone. This is motivated by well-known results in quantum physics which posit that, for certain single-round cooperative games with no communication, shared quantum entanglement enables strategies that outperform those that only use shared randomness. In such cases, we say that there is quantum advantage. Our framework is based on a novel differentiable policy parameterization that enables optimization over quantum measurements, together with a novel policy architecture that decomposes joint policies into a quantum coordinator and decentralized local actors. To illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we first show that we can learn, purely from experience, strategies that attain quantum advantage in single-round games that are treated as black box oracles. We then demonstrate how our machinery can learn policies with quantum advantage in an illustrative multi-agent sequential decision-making problem formulated as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u5229\u7528\u5171\u4eab\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u4f5c\u4e3a\u534f\u8c03\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MARL\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5fae\u7b56\u7565\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4e0e\u65b0\u578b\u7b56\u7565\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4f7f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u5728\u65e0\u901a\u4fe1\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u8d8a\u7ecf\u5178\u5171\u4eab\u968f\u673a\u6027\u7684\u534f\u540c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5355\u8f6e\u535a\u5f08\u548cDec-POMDP\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u91cf\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u2018\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u53ef\u5728\u65e0\u901a\u4fe1\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u8d8a\u5171\u4eab\u968f\u673a\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u2019\u8fd9\u4e00\u7ed3\u8bba\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4e3aMARL\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u81ea\u7531\u534f\u8c03\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u5fae\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5c06\u8054\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u2018\u91cf\u5b50\u534f\u8c03\u5668+\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u672c\u5730\u6267\u884c\u8005\u2019\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u7b56\u7565\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9ed1\u7bb1\u5355\u8f6e\u5408\u4f5c\u535a\u5f08\u548cDec-POMDP\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u7eaf\u4ece\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u5177\u6709\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5171\u4eab\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3aMARL\u4e2d\u4e00\u79cd\u5f3a\u5927\u4e14\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u65e0\u901a\u4fe1\u534f\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u5f00\u8f9f\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

First, we introduce a Top-K Rendering pipeline, a high-throughput and semantic-distortion-free method for efficiently rendering high-dimensional feature maps. To address the resulting semantic-geometric discrepancy and mitigate the memory consumption, we further design a multi-criteria map management strategy that prunes redundant or inconsistent Gaussians while preserving scene integrity. Finally, a hybrid field optimization framework jointly refines the geometric and semantic fields under real-time constraints by decoupling their optimization frequencies according to field characteristics. The proposed system achieves superior geometric fidelity compared to geometric-only baselines and comparable semantic fidelity to offline approaches while operating at 15 FPS.

In practice, preferences can be noisy, incomplete, or even misleading, which can degrade answer quality when applied naively. Motivated by the observation that stable personality traits shape everyday preferences, we study personality as a principled ''latent'' signal behind preference statements. Through extensive experiments, we find that conditioning on personality-aligned preferences substantially improves personalized question answering: selecting preferences consistent with a user's inferred personality increases answer-choice accuracy from 29.25% to 76%, compared to using randomly selected preferences. Based on these findings, we introduce PACIFIC (Preference Alignment Choices Inference for Five-factor Identity Characterization), a personality-labeled preference dataset containing 1200 preference statements spanning diverse domains (e.g., travel, movies, education), annotated with Big-Five (OCEAN) trait directions.

The Image Matching Challenge 2025 (IMC2025) highlights these difficulties by requiring both scene discovery and camera pose estimation under real-world conditions, including outliers and mixed content. This paper investigates the application of Gaussian-constrained representations inspired by LeJEPA (Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture) to address these challenges. We present three progressively refined pipelines, culminating in a LeJEPA-inspired approach that enforces isotropic Gaussian constraints on learned image embeddings. Rather than introducing new theoretical guarantees, our work empirically evaluates how these constraints influence clustering consistency and pose estimation robustness in practice. Experimental results on IMC2025 demonstrate that Gaussian-constrained embeddings can improve scene separation and pose plausibility compared to heuristic-driven baselines, particularly in visually ambiguous settings. These findings suggest that theoretically motivated representation constraints offer a promising direction for bridging self-supervised learning principles and practical structure-from-motion pipelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eLeJEPA\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u7ea6\u675f\u8868\u793a\u5728\u65e0\u76d1\u77633D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u6539\u8fdb\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728IMC2025\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u63d0\u5347\u573a\u666f\u5206\u79bb\u4e0e\u4f4d\u59ff\u4f30\u8ba1\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4ece\u591a\u573a\u666f\u3001\u65e0\u7ed3\u6784\u56fe\u50cf\u96c6\u5408\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u76d1\u77633D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5e94\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u6765\u6e90\u6df7\u6742\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u6b67\u4e49\u5927\u3001\u542b\u5927\u91cf\u5916\u70b9\u7b49\u73b0\u5b9e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0fpipeline\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u91c7\u7528LeJEPA\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0a\u65bd\u52a0\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u9ad8\u65af\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4e0d\u8ffd\u6c42\u65b0\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u800c\u4fa7\u91cd\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u8be5\u7ea6\u675f\u5bf9\u805a\u7c7b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u4f4d\u59ff\u4f30\u8ba1\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728IMC2025\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9ad8\u65af\u7ea6\u675f\u5d4c\u5165\u76f8\u6bd4\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u573a\u666f\u5206\u79bb\u548c\u4f4d\u59ff\u5408\u7406\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u6709\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u6b67\u4e49\u5927\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7406\u8bba\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u7ea6\u675f\u4e3a\u8fde\u63a5\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u539f\u7406\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645SfM\u6d41\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

We argue that this formulation is inefficient and lacks the structural inductive bias necessary for distinguishing between local feature preservation and global context integration. To address this, we introduce the Hybrid Dual-Path Linear (HDPL) operator, which decomposes the affine transformation into two topologically distinct pathways: a sparse block-diagonal component for high-rank local processing, and a low-rank Variational Autoencoder (VAE) bottleneck for global context regularization. By \"surgically\" replacing specific projections (Query, Key, Value, Gate, Up) with HDPL operators while retaining standard dense layers for aggregation (Output, Down), we achieve a superior balance of efficiency and representational power. Experiments on the FineWeb-Edu dataset demonstrate that the HDPL architecture outperforms a standard Llama-style baseline, reducing validation loss while simultaneously reducing parameter count by 6.8%. Beyond immediate performance gains, we discuss how the explicit materialization of a probabilistic latent space within the Transformer backbone serves as a vital architectural affordance, offering new pathways for inference-time or hypernetwork induced control, continual adaptation, interpretability, and cross-model or cross-modal synchronization.

Developing such agents requires diverse, large-scale datasets. Prior frameworks generate synthetic data for long-term human-robot interactions but fail to model the bidirectional influence between human behavior and household environments. Our proposed generative framework creates household datasets at scale through loosely coupled generation of long-term human-robot interactions and environments. Human personas influence environment generation, while environment schematics and semantics shape human-robot interactions.\n  The generated 3D data includes rich static context such as object and environment semantics, and temporal context capturing human and agent behaviors over extended periods. Our flexible tool allows users to define dataset characteristics via natural language prompts, enabling configuration of environment and human activity data through natural language specifications. The tool creates variations of user-defined configurations, enabling scalable data generation.\n  We validate our framework through statistical evaluation using multi-modal embeddings and key metrics: cosine similarity, mutual information gain, intervention analysis, and iterative improvement validation. Statistical comparisons show good alignment with real-world datasets (HOMER) with cosine similarity (0.60), while synthetic datasets (Wang et al.) show moderate alignment (0.27). Intervention analysis across age, organization, and sleep pattern changes shows statistically significant effects (p < 0.001) with large effect sizes (Cohen's d = 0.51-1.12), confirming bidirectional coupling translates persona traits into measurable environmental and behavioral differences.

However, natural language exhibits hierarchical structure from broad topics to specific entities that Euclidean embeddings fail to preserve, causing semantically distant documents to appear spuriously similar and increasing hallucination risk. To address these limitations, we introduce hyperbolic dense retrieval, developing two model variants in the Lorentz model of hyperbolic space: HyTE-FH, a fully hyperbolic transformer, and HyTE-H, a hybrid architecture projecting pre-trained Euclidean embeddings into hyperbolic space. To prevent representational collapse during sequence aggregation, we introduce the Outward Einstein Midpoint, a geometry-aware pooling operator that provably preserves hierarchical structure. On MTEB, HyTE-FH outperforms equivalent Euclidean baselines, while on RAGBench, HyTE-H achieves up to 29% gains over Euclidean baselines in context relevance and answer relevance using substantially smaller models than current state-of-the-art retrievers.

This paper surveys the state-of-the-art in the nexus of SLAM and Wireless Communications, attributing the bidirectional impact of each with a focus on visual SLAM (V-SLAM) integration. We provide an overview of key concepts related to wireless signal propagation, geometric channel modeling, and radio frequency (RF)-based localization and sensing. In addition to this, we show image processing techniques that can detect landmarks, proactively predicting optimal paths for wireless channels. Several dimensions are considered, including the prerequisites, techniques, background, and future directions and challenges of the intersection between SLAM and wireless communications. We analyze mathematical approaches such as probabilistic models, and spatial methods for signal processing, as well as key technological aspects. We expose techniques and items towards enabling a highly effective retrieval of the autonomous robot state. Among other interesting findings, we observe that monocular V-SLAM would benefit from RF relevant information, as the latter can serve as a proxy for the scale ambiguity resolution. Conversely, we find that wireless communications in the context of 5G and beyond can potentially benefit from visual odometry that is central in SLAM. Moreover, we examine other sources besides the camera for SLAM and describe the twofold relation with wireless communications. Finally, integrated solutions performing joint communications and SLAM are still in their infancy: theoretical and practical advancements are required to add higher-level localization and semantic perception capabilities to RF and multi-antenna technologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86SLAM\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u89c6\u89c9SLAM\uff09\u4e0e\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u6280\u672f\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e8c\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u534f\u540c\uff1aRF\u4fe1\u606f\u53ef\u8f85\u52a9\u89e3\u51b3\u5355\u76eeV-SLAM\u7684\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6a21\u7cca\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u89c6\u89c9\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u53ef\u63d0\u53475G\u53ca\u4ee5\u540e\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u5f53\u524d\u8054\u5408\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0eSLAM\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6848\u4ecd\u5904\u4e8e\u521d\u671f\uff0c\u9700\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u878d\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5546\u7528\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0e\u4f20\u611f\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u667a\u80fd\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u50ac\u751f\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0eSLAM\u6df1\u5ea6\u878d\u5408\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c1a\u672a\u7cfb\u7edf\u68b3\u7406\u4e8c\u8005\u53cc\u5411\u8d4b\u80fd\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u6280\u672f\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7efc\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u68b3\u7406\u65e0\u7ebf\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u64ad\u5efa\u6a21\u3001RF\u5b9a\u4f4d/\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u8def\u5f84\u9884\u6d4b\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u7b49\u6570\u5b66\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u8054\u5408\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5355\u76eeV-SLAM\u53ef\u501f\u52a9RF\u4fe1\u606f\u89e3\u51b3\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6a21\u7cca\uff1b5G+\u901a\u4fe1\u53ef\u5229\u7528SLAM\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u63d0\u5347\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u591a\u6e90SLAM\uff08\u975e\u4ec5\u76f8\u673a\uff09\u4e0e\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u5b58\u5728\u53cc\u91cd\u5173\u8054\uff1b\u4f46\u8054\u5408\u901a\u4fe1-SLAM\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ecd\u5904\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "conclusion": "SLAM\u4e0e\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4e92\u8865\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6848\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u9636\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u7cbe\u51c6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7406\u8bba\u7a81\u7834\u4e0e\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b9e\u8df5\u534f\u540c\u63a8\u8fdb\u3002"}}

In this paper, we address the challenges of long-context question answering in context of long-form answers given the idiosyncrasies of legal documents. We propose a question answering system that can (a) deconstruct domain-specific vocabulary for better retrieval from source documents, (b) parse complex document layouts while isolating sections and footnotes and linking them appropriately, (c) generate comprehensive answers using precise domain-specific vocabulary. We also introduce a coverage metric that classifies the performance into recall-based coverage categories allowing human users to evaluate the recall with ease. We curate a QA dataset by leveraging the expertise of professionals from fields such as law and corporate tax.

However, despite the superior performance of transformer-based models over convolutional architectures, their limited interpretability remains a major obstacle to clinical trust and deployment. Existing explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, including gradient-based saliency methods and perturbation-based approaches, are often computationally expensive, require numerous forward passes, and frequently produce noisy or anatomically irrelevant explanations. To address these limitations, we propose XAI-CLIP, an ROI-guided perturbation framework that leverages multimodal vision-language model embeddings to localize clinically meaningful anatomical regions and guide the explanation process. By integrating language-informed region localization with medical image segmentation and applying targeted, region-aware perturbations, the proposed method generates clearer, boundary-aware saliency maps while substantially reducing computational overhead. Experiments conducted on the FLARE22 and CHAOS datasets demonstrate that XAI-CLIP achieves up to a 60\\% reduction in runtime, a 44.6\\% improvement in dice score, and a 96.7\\% increase in Intersection-over-Union for occlusion-based explanations compared to conventional perturbation methods. Qualitative results further confirm cleaner and more anatomically consistent attribution maps with fewer artifacts, highlighting that the incorporation of multimodal vision-language representations into perturbation-based XAI frameworks significantly enhances both interpretability and efficiency, thereby enabling transparent and clinically deployable medical image segmentation systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faXAI-CLIP\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eROI\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5d4c\u5165\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u89e3\u5256\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709XAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3001\u89e3\u91ca\u566a\u58f0\u591a\u3001\u89e3\u5256\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e34\u5e8a\u4fe1\u4efb\u4e0e\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faXAI-CLIP\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7ed3\u5408CLIP\u7b49\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u8a00\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u89e3\u5256\u533a\u57df\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65bd\u533a\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5b9a\u5411\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u8fb9\u754c\u6e05\u6670\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u663e\u8457\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u5728FLARE22\u548cCHAOS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6270\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1160%\uff0cDice\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u534744.6%\uff0cIoU\u63d0\u534796.7%\uff1b\u5b9a\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u5f52\u56e0\u56fe\u66f4\u5e72\u51c0\u3001\u89e3\u5256\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u5f81\u5f15\u5165\u6270\u52a8\u578bXAI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

While existing hallucination detection methods achieve strong performance in question-answering tasks, they remain less effective on tasks requiring reasoning. In this work, we revisit hallucination detection through the lens of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, a well-studied problem in areas like computer vision. Treating next-token prediction in language models as a classification task allows us to apply OOD techniques, provided appropriate modifications are made to account for the structural differences in large language models. We show that OOD-based approaches yield training-free, single-sample-based detectors, achieving strong accuracy in hallucination detection for reasoning tasks. Overall, our work suggests that reframing hallucination detection as OOD detection provides a promising and scalable pathway toward language model safety.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u5916\uff08OOD\uff09\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u5355\u6837\u672c\u5373\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9700\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u8f83\u5dee\uff1b\u800cOOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\uff09\u5df2\u8f83\u6210\u719f\uff0c\u503c\u5f97\u501f\u9274\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bcd\u9884\u6d4b\u89c6\u4e3a\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u9002\u914d\u5e76\u5e94\u7528OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51fa\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0OOD-based\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u548c\u5355\u6837\u672c\u68c0\u6d4b\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u91cd\u65b0\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3aOOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u524d\u666f\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u5347\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Although classic optimal baseline theory can achieve global variance reduction, it neglects token heterogeneity and requires prohibitive gradient-based computation. In this work, we derive the Optimal Token Baseline (OTB) from first principles, proving that gradient updates should be weighted inversely to their cumulative gradient norm.

Generative models for materials could help, but are currently limited by the lack of high-quality training data. While recent video generative models effortlessly produce realistic material appearances, this knowledge remains entangled with geometry and lighting. We present VideoNeuMat, a two-stage pipeline that extracts reusable neural material assets from video diffusion models. First, we finetune a large video model (Wan 2.1 14B) to generate material sample videos under controlled camera and lighting trajectories, effectively creating a \"virtual gonioreflectometer\" that preserves the model's material realism while learning a structured measurement pattern. Second, we reconstruct compact neural materials from these videos through a Large Reconstruction Model (LRM) finetuned from a smaller Wan 1.3B video backbone. From 17 generated video frames, our LRM performs single-pass inference to predict neural material parameters that generalize to novel viewing and lighting conditions.

However, existing work has three key limitations: (1) most efforts focus on retrieval and ranking, while the reranking phase, critical for refining final recommendations, is largely overlooked; (2) LLMs are typically used in zero-shot or supervised fine-tuning settings, leaving their reasoning abilities, especially those enhanced through reinforcement learning (RL) and high-quality reasoning data, underexploited; (3) items are commonly represented by non-semantic IDs, creating major scalability challenges in industrial systems with billions of identifiers. To address these gaps, we propose the Generative Reasoning Reranker (GR2), an end-to-end framework with a three-stage training pipeline tailored for reranking. First, a pretrained LLM is mid-trained on semantic IDs encoded from non-semantic IDs via a tokenizer achieving $\\ge$99% uniqueness. Next, a stronger larger-scale LLM generates high-quality reasoning traces through carefully designed prompting and rejection sampling, which are used for supervised fine-tuning to impart foundational reasoning skills. Finally, we apply Decoupled Clip and Dynamic sAmpling Policy Optimization (DAPO), enabling scalable RL supervision with verifiable rewards designed specifically for reranking. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate GR2's effectiveness: it surpasses the state-of-the-art OneRec-Think by 2.4% in Recall@5 and 1.3% in NDCG@5.

We propose NAAMSE, an evolutionary framework that reframes agent security evaluation as a feedback-driven optimization problem. Our system employs a single autonomous agent that orchestrates a lifecycle of genetic prompt mutation, hierarchical corpus exploration, and asymmetric behavioral scoring. By using model responses as a fitness signal, the framework iteratively compounds effective attack strategies while simultaneously ensuring \"benign-use correctness\", preventing the degenerate security of blanket refusal. Our experiments on Gemini 2.5 Flash demonstrate that evolutionary mutation systematically amplifies vulnerabilities missed by one-shot methods, with controlled ablations revealing that the synergy between exploration and targeted mutation uncovers high-severity failure modes.

These environments often involve delicate laboratory equipment, unpredictable environmental interactions, and occasional human intervention, making compliant and force aware control essential for ensuring safety, adaptability, and reliability. This paper introduces a motion-planning framework centered on admittance control to enable adaptive and compliant robotic manipulation. Unlike conventional schemes, the proposed approach integrates an admittance controller directly into trajectory execution, allowing the manipulator to dynamically respond to external forces during interaction. This capability enables human operators to override or redirect the robot's motion in real time. A vision algorithm based on structured planar pose estimation is employed to detect and localize textured planar objects through feature extraction, homography estimation, and depth fusion, thereby providing an initial target configuration for motion planning. The vision based initialization establishes the reference trajectory, while the embedded admittance controller ensures that trajectory execution remains safe, adaptive, and responsive to external forces or human intervention. The proposed strategy is validated using textured image detection as a proof of concept. Future work will extend the framework to SDL environments involving transparent laboratory objects where compliant motion planning can further enhance autonomy, safety, and human-robot collaboration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bfc\u7eb3\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u9a71\u52a8\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u67d4\u987a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u76ee\u6807\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u521d\u59cb\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65f6\u529b\u54cd\u5e94\u63d0\u5347\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u9a71\u52a8\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\uff08SDLs\uff09\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7cbe\u5bc6\u8bbe\u5907\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u53ca\u5076\u5c14\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5177\u5907\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u4e0e\u529b\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u4fdd\u969c\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u5bfc\u7eb3\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u76f4\u63a5\u5d4c\u5165\u8f68\u8ff9\u6267\u884c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5e73\u9762\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u3001\u5355\u5e94\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u878d\u5408\u5b9e\u73b0\u7eb9\u7406\u5e73\u9762\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u521d\u59cb\u76ee\u6807\u6784\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5bf9\u5916\u90e8\u529b\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u54cd\u5e94\u4e0e\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u7eb9\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e3a\u6982\u5ff5\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u67d4\u987a\u6027\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5c06\u62d3\u5c55\u81f3\u900f\u660e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5668\u76bf\u7b49\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684SDL\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

However, most speech LLMs are trained on single-channel, single-talker data, which makes it challenging to directly apply them to multi-talker and multi-channel speech understanding task. In this work, we present a comprehensive investigation on how to enable directional multi-talker speech understanding capabilities for LLMs, specifically in smart glasses usecase. We propose two novel approaches to integrate directivity into LLMs: (1) a cascaded system that leverages a source separation front-end module, and (2) an end-to-end system that utilizes serialized output training. All of the approaches utilize a multi-microphone array embedded in smart glasses to optimize directivity interpretation and processing in a streaming manner.

Existing bird strike prevention strategies primarily rely on avian radar systems that detect and track birds in real time. A major limitation of these systems is their inability to identify bird species, an essential factor, as different species exhibit distinct flight behaviors, and altitudinal preference. To address this challenge, we propose an image-based bird classification framework using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), designed to work with camera systems for autonomous visual detection. The CNN is designed to identify bird species and provide critical input to species-specific predictive models for accurate flight path prediction. In addition to species identification, we implemented dedicated CNN classifiers to estimate flock formation type and flock size. These characteristics provide valuable supplementary information for aviation safety. Specifically, flock type and size offer insights into collective flight behavior, and trajectory dispersion . Flock size directly relates to the potential impact severity, as the overall damage risk increases with the combined kinetic energy of multiple birds.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eCNN\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8bc6\u522b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9e1f\u7c7b\u7269\u79cd\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u9e1f\u7fa4\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0e\u89c4\u6a21\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u9e1f\u51fb\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u822a\u7a7a\u5b89\u5168\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u96f7\u8fbe\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u9e1f\u7c7b\u7269\u79cd\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u540c\u7269\u79cd\u7684\u98de\u884c\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u504f\u597d\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u9e1f\u51fb\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08CNN\uff09\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9e1f\u7c7b\u7269\u79cd\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u9e1f\u7fa4\u7c7b\u578b\u5224\u65ad\u53ca\u9e1f\u7fa4\u89c4\u6a21\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u4e3b\u89c6\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9e1f\u7c7b\u7269\u79cd\u3001\u9e1f\u7fa4\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0e\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u4e3a\u7269\u79cd\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u98de\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u9884\u6d4b\u53ca\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u952e\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc6\u522b\u6846\u67b6\u5f25\u8865\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u96f7\u8fbe\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u9e1f\u7c7b\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9e1f\u51fb\u9884\u8b66\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u6027\u4e0e\u822a\u7a7a\u5b89\u5168\u6c34\u5e73\u3002"}}

Existing safety frameworks largely treat alignment as a static optimization problem (e.g., tuning models to desired behavior) while overlooking the dynamic, adversarial incentives that shape how data are collected, how models are evaluated, and how they are ultimately deployed. We propose a new perspective on AI safety grounded in Stackelberg Security Games (SSGs): a class of game-theoretic models designed for adversarial resource allocation under uncertainty. By viewing AI oversight as a strategic interaction between defenders (auditors, evaluators, and deployers) and attackers (malicious actors, misaligned contributors, or worst-case failure modes), SSGs provide a unifying framework for reasoning about incentive design, limited oversight capacity, and adversarial uncertainty across the AI lifecycle. We illustrate how this framework can inform (1) training-time auditing against data/feedback poisoning, (2) pre-deployment evaluation under constrained reviewer resources, and (3) robust multi-model deployment in adversarial environments.

Despite significant advances in deep learning based registration methods, accurately aligning images with large deformations while preserving anatomical plausibility remains a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel Attention-Driven Framework for Non-Rigid Medical Image Registration (AD-RegNet) that employs attention mechanisms to guide the registration process. Our approach combines a 3D UNet backbone with bidirectional cross-attention, which establishes correspondences between moving and fixed images at multiple scales. We introduce a regional adaptive attention mechanism that focuses on anatomically relevant structures, along with a multi-resolution deformation field synthesis approach for accurate alignment. The method is evaluated on two distinct datasets: DIRLab for thoracic 4D CT scans and IXI for brain MRI scans, demonstrating its versatility across different anatomical structures and imaging modalities.

Project page: https://maxmilite.github.io/rec-from-ultrafast-blur/", "summary": "We consider the problem of 3D shape recovery from ultra-fast motion-blurred images. While 3D reconstruction from static images has been extensively studied, recovering geometry from extreme motion-blurred images remains challenging. Such scenarios frequently occur in both natural and industrial settings, such as fast-moving objects in sports (e.g., balls) or rotating machinery, where rapid motion distorts object appearance and makes traditional 3D reconstruction techniques like Multi-View Stereo (MVS) ineffective.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel inverse rendering approach for shape recovery from ultra-fast motion-blurred images. While conventional rendering techniques typically synthesize blur by averaging across multiple frames, we identify a major computational bottleneck in the repeated computation of barycentric weights. To address this, we propose a fast barycentric coordinate solver, which significantly reduces computational overhead and achieves a speedup of up to 4.57x, enabling efficient and photorealistic simulation of high-speed motion. Crucially, our method is fully differentiable, allowing gradients to propagate from rendered images to the underlying 3D shape, thereby facilitating shape recovery through inverse rendering.\n  We validate our approach on two representative motion types: rapid translation and rotation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method enables efficient and realistic modeling of ultra-fast moving objects in the forward simulation. Moreover, it successfully recovers 3D shapes from 2D imagery of objects undergoing extreme translational and rotational motion, advancing the boundaries of vision-based 3D reconstruction.

While large language models (LLMs) show promise for such tasks, they are often overwhelmed by the entangled nature of high-dimensional perturbation results. Moreover, recent works have primarily focused on genetic perturbations in single-cell experiments, leaving bulk-cell chemical perturbations, which is central to drug discovery, largely unexplored. Motivated by this, we present LINCSQA, a novel benchmark for predicting target gene regulation under complex chemical perturbations in bulk-cell environments. We further propose PBio-Agent, a multi-agent framework that integrates difficulty-aware task sequencing with iterative knowledge refinement.

However, traditional Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment (HARA) methods struggle to scale in this domain. While HARA relies on enumerating risks for finite and pre-defined function lists, Embodied AI operates on open-ended natural language instructions, creating a challenge of combinatorial interaction risks. Whereas Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising solution to this scalability challenge, they often lack physical grounding, yielding semantically superficial and incoherent hazard descriptions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new framework ARGOS (AttRibute-Guided cOmbinatorial reaSoning), which bridges the gap between open-ended user instructions and concrete physical attributes. By dynamically decomposing entities from instructions into these fine-grained properties, ARGOS grounds LLM reasoning in causal risk factors to generate physically plausible hazard scenarios. It then instantiates abstract safety standards, such as ISO 13482, into context-specific Functional Safety Requirements (FSRs) by integrating these scenarios with robot capabilities. Extensive experiments validate that ARGOS produces high-quality FSRs and outperforms baselines in identifying long-tail risks.

However, existing hallucination standards and evaluation metrics focus primarily on factual correctness, treating all errors as equally severe. This obscures clinically relevant failure modes, particularly when models generate unsupported but actionable medical language. We propose a risk-sensitive evaluation framework that quantifies hallucinations through the presence of risk-bearing language, including treatment directives, contraindications, urgency cues, and mentions of high-risk medications. Rather than assessing clinical correctness, our approach evaluates the potential impact of hallucinated content if acted upon. We further combine risk scoring with a relevance measure to identify high-risk, low-grounding failures. We apply this framework to three instruction-tuned language models using controlled patient-facing prompts designed as safety stress tests. Our results show that models with similar surface-level behavior exhibit substantially different risk profiles and that standard evaluation metrics fail to capture these distinctions. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating risk sensitivity into hallucination evaluation and suggest that evaluation validity is critically dependent on task and prompt design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u98ce\u9669\u654f\u611f\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u533b\u7597\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u5b9e\u9645\u5371\u5bb3\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u6027\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982\u6cbb\u7597\u6307\u4ee4\u3001\u7981\u5fcc\u75c7\u3001\u7d27\u6025\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u836f\u7269\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u60a3\u8005\u9762\u5411\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5371\u5bb3\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5e7b\u89c9\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5173\u6ce8\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u9519\u8bef\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5371\u5bb3\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u90a3\u4e9b\u867d\u65e0\u4f9d\u636e\u4f46\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u7684\u5371\u9669\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u98ce\u9669\u627f\u8f7d\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982\u6cbb\u7597\u6307\u4ee4\u3001\u7981\u5fcc\u75c7\u3001\u7d27\u8feb\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u836f\u7269\uff09\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4e14\u4f4e\u4f9d\u636e\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5931\u8d25\uff1b\u5728\u4e09\u7c7b\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u60a3\u8005\u9762\u5411\u5b89\u5168\u538b\u529b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63d0\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u8868\u9762\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u8fd1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u4f20\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u65e0\u6cd5\u63ed\u793a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5173\u952e\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e7b\u89c9\u8bc4\u4f30\u5fc5\u987b\u5f15\u5165\u98ce\u9669\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5177\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0e\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

While these errors mirror human cognitive constraints, such as the \"Binding Problem\", the internal mechanisms driving them in artificial systems remain poorly understood. Here, we propose a mechanistic insight by analyzing the representational geometry of open-weight VLMs (Qwen, InternVL, Gemma), comparing methodologies to distill \"concept vectors\" - latent directions encoding visual concepts. We validate our concept vectors via steering interventions that reliably manipulate model behavior in both simplified and naturalistic vision tasks (e.g., forcing the model to perceive a red flower as blue). We observe that the geometric overlap between these vectors strongly correlates with specific error patterns, offering a grounded quantitative framework to understand how internal representations shape model behavior and drive visual failures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5728\u591a\u7269\u4f53\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u5e7b\u89c9\u6216\u8bc6\u522b\u5931\u8d25\u7b49\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u5185\u5728\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5f00\u653e\u6743\u91cdVLMs\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u2018\u6982\u5ff5\u5411\u91cf\u2019\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u53ef\u64cd\u63a7\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6982\u5ff5\u5411\u91cf\u95f4\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u91cd\u53e0\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9a\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u5f0f\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "VLMs\u5728\u591a\u7269\u4f53\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u9650\u5236\uff08\u5982\u2018\u7ed1\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u2019\uff09\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790Qwen\u3001InternVL\u3001Gemma\u7b49\u5f00\u653e\u6743\u91cdVLMs\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u2018\u6982\u5ff5\u5411\u91cf\u2019\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5e72\u9884\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08steering interventions\uff09\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u8c03\u63a7\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u6982\u5ff5\u5411\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u91cd\u53e0\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5b9a\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u5982\u5e7b\u89c9\u3001\u8bef\u8bc6\u522b\uff09\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3VLM\u89c6\u89c9\u5931\u8d25\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9a\u91cf\u8868\u5f81\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "VLMs\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5931\u8d25\u6839\u6e90\u53ef\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u6982\u5ff5\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6982\u5ff5\u5411\u91cf\u95f4\u7684\u975e\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u6216\u91cd\u53e0\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Existing approaches that rely on direct human task completion time annotations are costly, noisy, and difficult to scale across benchmarks. In this work, we propose BRIDGE, a unified psychometric framework that learns the latent difficulty scale from model responses and anchors it to human task completion time. Using a two-parameter logistic Item Response Theory model, we jointly estimate latent task difficulty and model capability from model performance data across multiple benchmarks. We demonstrate that latent task difficulty varies linearly with the logarithm of human completion time, allowing human task completion time to be inferred for new benchmarks from model performance alone.

While substantial progress has been made in single-table synthetic generation where data are modeled at the row or item level, most real-world data exists in relational databases where a user's information spans items across multiple interconnected tables. Recent advances in synthetic relational data generation have emerged to address this complexity, yet release of these data introduce unique privacy challenges as information can be leaked not only from individual items but also through the relationships that comprise a complete user entity.\n  To address this, we propose a novel Membership Inference Attack (MIA) setting to audit the empirical user-level privacy of synthetic relational data and show that single-table MIAs that audit at an item level underestimate user-level privacy leakage. We then propose Multi-Table Membership Inference Attack (MT-MIA), a novel adversarial attack under a No-Box threat model that targets learned representations of user entities via Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks. By incorporating all connected items for a user, MT-MIA better targets user-level vulnerabilities induced by inter-tabular relationships than existing attacks. We evaluate MT-MIA on a range of real-world multi-table datasets and demonstrate that this vulnerability exists in state-of-the-art relational synthetic data generators, employing MT-MIA to additionally study where this leakage occurs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u8868\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u653b\u51fb\uff08MT-MIA\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5408\u6210\u5173\u7cfb\u578b\u6570\u636e\u5728\u7528\u6237\u7ea7\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u8868\u653b\u51fb\u4f4e\u4f30\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u5148\u8fdb\u5173\u7cfb\u578b\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7528\u6237\u7ea7\u9690\u79c1\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u5355\u8868\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u653b\u51fb\uff09\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u884c/\u9879\u7ea7\u6cc4\u9732\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u523b\u753b\u5173\u7cfb\u578b\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e2d\u8de8\u8868\u5173\u8054\u6240\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7528\u6237\u7ea7\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u8868\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u653b\u51fb\uff08MT-MIA\uff09\uff0c\u5728No-Box\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5efa\u6a21\u7528\u6237\u5b9e\u4f53\u53ca\u5176\u8de8\u8868\u5173\u8054\u9879\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u7ea7\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u5ba1\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u591a\u8868\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86MT-MIA\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u4e3b\u6d41\u5173\u7cfb\u578b\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5668\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u7528\u6237\u7ea7\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\uff0c\u4e14\u6cc4\u9732\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u8de8\u8868\u5173\u7cfb\u5efa\u6a21\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7528\u6237\u7ea7\u9690\u79c1\u9700\u4e13\u95e8\u5efa\u6a21\u8de8\u8868\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5355\u8868\u9690\u79c1\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u5145\u5206\uff1bMT-MIA\u4e3a\u5173\u7cfb\u578b\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u660e\u4e86\u63d0\u5347\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u5173\u952e\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

First, we formulate 3D shape personalization as extracting reusable, category-agnostic geometric and appearance attributes from reference shapes, and composing these attributes with text to generate novel shapes. Second, we design a progressive optimization strategy to learn shape concepts at both the geometry and appearance levels, decoupling the shape concept learning process. Third, we extend our approach to region-wise concept learning, enabling flexible concept extraction, with context-aware and context-free losses.

Recently, driven by the strong generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs), LLM-based generative recommendation has become increasingly popular. However, we observe that existing methods inevitably introduce systematic bias when estimating item-level preference distributions. Specifically, autoregressive generation suffers from incomplete coverage due to beam search pruning, while parallel generation distorts probabilities by assuming token independence. We attribute this issue to a fundamental modeling mismatch: these methods approximate item-level distributions via token-level generation, which inherently induces approximation errors. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that token-level generation cannot faithfully substitute item-level generation, leading to biased item distributions. To address this, we propose \\textbf{Sim}ply \\textbf{G}enerative \\textbf{R}ecommendation (\\textbf{SimGR}), a framework that directly models item-level preference distributions in a shared latent space and ranks items by similarity, thereby aligning the modeling objective with recommendation and mitigating distributional distortion. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and LLM backbones show that SimGR consistently outperforms existing generative recommenders.

We introduce a two-stage gradient-based framework that provides interpretable diagnostics for three critical failure analysis tasks: (1) detecting the true initial failure source (Patient-0); (2) validating why non-attacked agents may be flagged first due to domino effects; and (3) tracing how failures propagate through learned coordination pathways. Stage 1 performs interpretable per-agent failure detection via Taylor-remainder analysis of policy-gradient costs, declaring an initial Patient-0 candidate at the first threshold crossing. Stage 2 provides validation through geometric analysis of critic derivatives-first-order sensitivity and directional second-order curvature aggregated over causal windows to construct interpretable contagion graphs. This approach explains \"downstream-first\" detection anomalies by revealing pathways that amplify upstream deviations. Evaluated across 500 episodes in Simple Spread (3 and 5 agents) and 100 episodes in StarCraft II using MADDPG and HATRPO, our method achieves 88.2-99.4% Patient-0 detection accuracy while providing interpretable geometric evidence for detection decisions.

Users often employ follow-up questions to refine their intent, expecting LLMs to adapt dynamically. However, recent research reveals that LLMs suffer a substantial performance drop in multi-turn settings compared to single-turn interactions with fully specified instructions, a phenomenon termed ``Lost in Conversation'' (LiC). While this prior work attributes LiC to model unreliability, we argue that the root cause lies in an intent alignment gap rather than intrinsic capability deficits. In this paper, we first demonstrate that LiC is not a failure of model capability but rather a breakdown in interaction between users and LLMs. We theoretically show that scaling model size or improving training alone cannot resolve this gap, as it arises from structural ambiguity in conversational context rather than representational limitations. To address this, we propose to decouple intent understanding from task execution through a Mediator-Assistant architecture. By utilizing an experience-driven Mediator to explicate user inputs into explicit, well-structured instructions based on historical interaction patterns, our approach effectively bridges the gap between vague user intent and model interpretation. Experimental results demonstrate that this method significantly mitigates performance degradation in multi-turn conversations across diverse LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff08'Lost in Conversation'\uff09\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u5728\u4e8e\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u7406\u89e3\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b\u4e3a\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd'\u4e2d\u4ecb-\u52a9\u624b'\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4e2d\u4ecb\u6a21\u5757\u5c06\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u7528\u6237\u8f93\u5165\u663e\u5f0f\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u4f46\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u7406\u89e3\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9\u9f50\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u5728\u80fd\u529b\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMediator-Assistant\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u7531\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9a71\u52a8\u7684Mediator\u6a21\u5757\u57fa\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u7528\u6237\u6a21\u7cca\u8f93\u5165\u663e\u5f0f\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u89e3\u8026\u610f\u56fe\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u6e90\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u8bed\u5883\u6b67\u4e49\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u610f\u56fe\u5bf9\u9f50 gap\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u5f81\u80fd\u529b\u9650\u5236\uff1b\u6240\u63d0\u4e2d\u4ecb\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u8be5 gap\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8f6e\u4ea4\u4e92\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Prior approaches to bridge this gap are largely limited by oversimplified isotropic assumptions, hindering their application in large-scale scenarios. In this paper, we address these limitations by precisely characterizing the geometric shape of the modality gap and leveraging it for efficient model scaling. First, we propose the Fixed-frame Modality Gap Theory, which decomposes the modality gap within a frozen reference frame into stable biases and anisotropic residuals. Guided by this precise modeling, we introduce ReAlign, a training-free modality alignment strategy. Utilizing statistics from massive unpaired data, ReAlign aligns text representation into the image representation distribution via a three-step process comprising Anchor, Trace, and Centroid Alignment, thereby explicitly rectifying geometric misalignment. Building on ReAlign, we propose ReVision, a scalable training paradigm for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). ReVision integrates ReAlign into the pretraining stage, enabling the model to learn the distribution of visual representations from unpaired text before visual instruction tuning, without the need for large-scale, high-quality image-text pairs. Our framework demonstrates that statistically aligned unpaired data can effectively substitute for expensive image-text pairs, offering a robust path for the efficient scaling of MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFixed-frame Modality Gap Theory\uff0c\u7cbe\u51c6\u523b\u753b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\u95f4\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5dee\u5f02\uff08\u5373\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u9699\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565ReAlign\u53ca\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684MLLM\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0fReVision\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6d77\u91cf\u65e0\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7f29\u653e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8fc7\u4e8e\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u9699\uff08Modality Gap\uff09\u51e0\u4f55\u5f02\u5e38\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFixed-frame Modality Gap Theory\uff0c\u5c06\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u9699\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u504f\u7f6e\u4e0e\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u6b8b\u5dee\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u7684ReAlign\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u542bAnchor\u3001Trace\u3001Centroid\u4e09\u6b65\u5bf9\u9f50\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u65e0\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u9f50\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u8868\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6784\u5efaReVision\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06ReAlign\u878d\u5165MLLM\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "ReVision\u53ef\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u6587\u5bf9\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f7fMLLM\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u524d\u5373\u5b66\u4e60\u56fe\u50cf\u8868\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u7edf\u8ba1\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u65e0\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u6602\u8d35\u56fe\u6587\u5bf9\uff0c\u63d0\u5347MLLM\u6269\u5c55\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7cbe\u51c6\u5efa\u6a21\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u9699\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u65e0\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4e00\u6761\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u7a33\u5065\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

First, high-fidelity, executable training environments are scarce: environments synthesized from real-world repositories are not diverse and scalable, while trajectories synthesized by LLMs suffer from hallucinations. Second, standard instruction tuning uses expert trajectories that rarely exhibit simple mistakes common to smaller models. This creates a distributional mismatch, leaving student models ill-equipped to recover from their own runtime failures. To bridge these gaps, we introduce TermiGen, an end-to-end pipeline for synthesizing verifiable environments and resilient expert trajectories. Termi-Gen first generates functionally valid tasks and Docker containers via an iterative multi-agent refinement loop. Subsequently, we employ a Generator-Critic protocol that actively injects errors during trajectory collection, synthesizing data rich in error-correction cycles. Fine-tuned on this TermiGen-generated dataset, our TermiGen-Qwen2.5-Coder-32B achieves a 31.3% pass rate on TerminalBench. This establishes a new open-weights state-of-the-art, outperforming existing baselines and notably surpassing capable proprietary models such as o4-mini.

A key component is the Saddle-Minimum Average Distance (SMAD) for quantifying landscape smoothness. We demonstrate Landscaper's effectiveness across various architectures and tasks, including those involving pre-trained language models, showing that SMAD captures training transitions, such as landscape simplification, that conventional metrics miss.

In this paper, we present an efficient learning-free 4D Gaussian segmentation framework that lifts video segmentation masks to 4D spaces, whose core is a two-stage iterative boundary refinement, TIBR4D. The first stage is an Iterative Gaussian Instance Tracing (IGIT) at the temporal segment level. It progressively refines Gaussian-to-instance probabilities through iterative tracing, and extracts corresponding Gaussian point clouds that better handle occlusions and preserve completeness of object structures compared to existing one-shot threshold-based methods. The second stage is a frame-wise Gaussian Rendering Range Control (RCC) via suppressing highly uncertain Gaussians near object boundaries while retaining their core contributions for more accurate boundaries. Furthermore, a temporal segmentation merging strategy is proposed for IGIT to balance identity consistency and dynamic awareness. Longer segments enforce stronger multi-frame constraints for stable identities, while shorter segments allow identity changes to be captured promptly. Experiments on HyperNeRF and Neu3D demonstrate that our method produces accurate object Gaussian point clouds with clearer boundaries and higher efficiency compared to SOTA methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9ad8\u65484D\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6TIBR4D\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8fed\u4ee3\u8fb9\u754c\u4f18\u5316\uff08IGIT\u548cRCC\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u52a8\u60014D\u9ad8\u65af\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7269\u4f53\u7ea7\u5206\u5272\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a8\u60014D\u9ad8\u65af\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u7ea7\u5206\u5272\u9762\u4e34\u8fd0\u52a8\u590d\u6742\u3001\u906e\u6321\u4e25\u91cd\u53ca\u8fb9\u754c\u6a21\u7cca\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8fed\u4ee3\u8fb9\u754c\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u7247\u6bb5\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u9ad8\u65af\u5b9e\u4f8b\u8ffd\u8e2a\uff08IGIT\uff09\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u4e3a\u9010\u5e27\u9ad8\u65af\u6e32\u67d3\u8303\u56f4\u63a7\u5236\uff08RCC\uff09\uff1b\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u5272\u5408\u5e76\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728HyperNeRF\u548cNeu3D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u9ad8\u65af\u70b9\u4e91\u8fb9\u754c\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u3001\u7cbe\u5ea6\u66f4\u9ad8\u3001\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "TIBR4D\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u81ea\u7531\u76844D\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u3001\u906e\u6321\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u6a21\u7cca\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

In this work, we focus on the post-ranking stage and present LAFB (Learning to Alleviate Familiarity Bias), a lightweight and model-agnostic framework designed to mitigate familiarity bias in recommendation outputs. LAFB models user-content familiarity using discrete and continuous interaction features, and estimates personalized debiasing factors to adjust user rating prediction scores, thereby reducing the dominance of familiar content in the final ranking.

The airspace model captures dense air traffic departure and arrival flows, helicopter corridors, and prohibited zones and is demonstrated with a Washington, D.C., area case study. Historical Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data are processed to estimate air traffic density. A low-latency computational geometry algorithm generates proximity-based heatmaps around high-risk corridors and restricted regions. Airspace risk is quantified as the cumulative exposure time of a landing trajectory within congested regions, while ground risk is assessed from overflown population density to jointly guide trajectory selection. A landing site selection module further mitigates disruption to nominal air traffic operations. Benchmarking against minimum-risk Dubins solutions demonstrates that the proposed planner achieves lower joint risk and reduced airspace disruption while maintaining real-time performance. Under airspace-risk-only conditions, the planner generates trajectories within an average of 2.9 seconds on a laptop computer. Future work will incorporate dynamic air traffic updates to enable spatiotemporal contingency landing planning that minimizes the need for real-time traffic rerouting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u98de\u673a\u5e94\u6025\u7740\u9646\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u7a7a\u57df\u98ce\u9669\uff08\u4ea4\u901a\u5bc6\u5ea6\u66b4\u9732\u65f6\u95f4\uff09\u548c\u5730\u9762\u98ce\u9669\uff08\u4eba\u53e3\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u534e\u76db\u987f\u7279\u533a\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u3001\u4f4e\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u7740\u9646\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u8017\u65f62.9\u79d2\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eDubins\u6700\u5c0f\u98ce\u9669\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e94\u5bf9\u98de\u673a\u7a81\u53d1\u72b6\u51b5\u9700\u5feb\u901f\u9009\u62e9\u5b89\u5168\u7740\u9646\u70b9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5bf9\u65e2\u6709\u7a7a\u57df\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u548c\u5730\u9762\u4eba\u53e3\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u3001\u591a\u6e90\u98ce\u9669\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u8fd0\u884c\u5e72\u6270\u6291\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u878d\u5408\u7a7a\u57df\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u8d77\u964d\u6d41\u3001\u76f4\u5347\u673a\u8d70\u5eca\u3001\u7981\u98de\u533a\uff09\u4e0e\u5386\u53f2ADS-B\u6d41\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7a7a\u57df\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8ba1\u7b97\u51e0\u4f55\u7b97\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u533a\u57df\u90bb\u8fd1\u70ed\u529b\u56fe\uff1b\u5b9a\u4e49\u7a7a\u57df\u98ce\u9669\uff08\u8f68\u8ff9\u5728\u62e5\u5835\u533a\u7d2f\u8ba1\u66b4\u9732\u65f6\u95f4\uff09\u4e0e\u5730\u9762\u98ce\u9669\uff08\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0b\u65b9\u4eba\u53e3\u5bc6\u5ea6\u79ef\u5206\uff09\u8054\u5408\u4ee3\u4ef7\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u7740\u9646\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u5757\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u5e38\u89c4\u822a\u73ed\u5e72\u6270\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u534e\u76db\u987f\u7279\u533a\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5c0f\u98ce\u9669Dubins\u89e3\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8054\u5408\u98ce\u9669\u4e0e\u7a7a\u57df\u5e72\u6270\uff1b\u4ec5\u8003\u8651\u7a7a\u57df\u98ce\u9669\u65f6\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u89c4\u5212\u65f6\u95f42.9\u79d2\uff08\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u7535\u8111\uff09\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u65f6\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u641c\u7d22\u5f0f\u5e94\u6025\u7740\u9646\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u4e0e\u8fd0\u884c\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u57ce\u5e02\u590d\u6742\u7a7a\u57df\u4e0b\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a/\u901a\u822a\u5e94\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\uff1b\u540e\u7eed\u5c06\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u7a7a\u60c5\u66f4\u65b0\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u65f6\u7a7a\u8054\u5408\u89c4\u5212\u3002"}}

Quan"], "title": "ViHERMES: A Graph-Grounded Multihop Question Answering Benchmark and System for Vietnamese Healthcare Regulations", "comment": "Accepted at ACIIDS 2026", "summary": "Question Answering (QA) over regulatory documents is inherently challenging due to the need for multihop reasoning across legally interdependent texts, a requirement that is particularly pronounced in the healthcare domain where regulations are hierarchically structured and frequently revised through amendments and cross-references. Despite recent progress in retrieval-augmented and graph-based QA methods, systematic evaluation in this setting remains limited, especially for low-resource languages such as Vietnamese, due to the lack of benchmark datasets that explicitly support multihop reasoning over healthcare regulations. In this work, we introduce the Vietnamese Healthcare Regulations-Multihop Reasoning Dataset (ViHERMES), a benchmark designed for multihop QA over Vietnamese healthcare regulatory documents. ViHERMES consists of high-quality question-answer pairs that require reasoning across multiple regulations and capture diverse dependency patterns, including amendment tracing, cross-document comparison, and procedural synthesis. To construct the dataset, we propose a controlled multihop QA generation pipeline based on semantic clustering and graph-inspired data mining, followed by large language model-based generation with structured evidence and reasoning annotations. We further present a graph-aware retrieval framework that models formal legal relations at the level of legal units and supports principled context expansion for legally valid and coherent answers. Experimental results demonstrate that ViHERMES provides a challenging benchmark for evaluating multihop regulatory QA systems and that the proposed graph-aware approach consistently outperforms strong retrieval-based baselines.

Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) aims to improve robustness using only unlabeled test samples, yet most prompt-based TTA methods rely on entropy minimization -- an approach that can amplify spurious correlations and induce overconfident errors when classes share visual features. We propose Fair Context Learning (FCL), an episodic TTA framework that avoids entropy minimization by explicitly addressing shared-evidence bias. Motivated by our additive evidence decomposition assumption, FCL decouples adaptation into (i) augmentation-based exploration to identify plausible class candidates, and (ii) fairness-driven calibration that adapts text contexts to equalize sensitivity to common visual evidence. This fairness constraint mitigates partial feature obsession and enables effective calibration of text embeddings without relying on entropy reduction. Through extensive evaluation, we empirically validate our theoretical motivation and show that FCL achieves competitive adaptation performance relative to state-of-the-art TTA methods across diverse domain-shift and fine-grained benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aFair Context Learning\uff08FCL\uff09\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff08TTA\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982CLIP\uff09\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u907f\u514d\u71b5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u3001\u89e3\u8026\u589e\u5f3a\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6821\u51c6\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u5171\u4eab\u8bc1\u636e\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684TTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u71b5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\uff0c\u6613\u653e\u5927\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3001\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5f53\u7c7b\u522b\u5171\u4eab\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u65f6\uff1b\u800cVLMs\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "FCL\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9636\u6bb5\u6027TTA\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\uff08i\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u6f5c\u5728\u7c7b\u522b\u5019\u9009\uff1b\uff08ii\uff09\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5171\u6709\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\u5177\u6709\u5747\u7b49\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7f13\u89e3\u90e8\u5206\u7279\u5f81\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cFCL\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18TTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u52a8\u673a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "FCL\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u5171\u4eab\u8bc1\u636e\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4e3aVLMs\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u6613\u51fa\u9519\u7684\u71b5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u3002"}}

To address this limitation, we propose STEER2ADAPT, a lightweight framework that adapts LLMs by composing steering vectors rather than learning new ones from scratch. In many domains (e.g., reasoning or safety), tasks share a small set of underlying concept dimensions. STEER2ADAPT captures these dimensions as a reusable, low-dimensional semantic prior subspace, and adapts to new tasks by dynamically discovering a linear combination of basis vectors from only a handful of examples. Experiments across 9 tasks and 3 models in both reasoning and safety domains demonstrate the effectiveness of STEER2ADAPT, achieving an average improvement of 8.2%.

Victoria Velasco"], "title": "Featured Reproducing Kernel Banach Spaces for Learning and Neural Networks", "comment": null, "summary": "Reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces provide a foundational framework for kernel-based learning, where regularization and interpolation problems admit finite-dimensional solutions through classical representer theorems. Many modern learning models, however -- including fixed-architecture neural networks equipped with non-quadratic norms -- naturally give rise to non-Hilbertian geometries that fall outside this setting. In Banach spaces, continuity of point-evaluation functionals alone is insufficient to guarantee feature representations or kernel-based learning formulations. In this work, we develop a functional-analytic framework for learning in Banach spaces based on the notion of featured reproducing kernel Banach spaces. We identify the precise structural conditions under which feature maps, kernel constructions, and representer-type results can be recovered beyond the Hilbertian regime. Within this framework, supervised learning is formulated as a minimal-norm interpolation or regularization problem, and existence results together with conditional representer theorems are established. We further extend the theory to vector-valued featured reproducing kernel Banach spaces and show that fixed-architecture neural networks naturally induce special instances of such spaces. This provides a unified function-space perspective on kernel methods and neural networks and clarifies when kernel-based learning principles extend beyond reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411Banach\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u2014\u2014\u7279\u5f81\u518d\u751f\u6838Banach\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08FRKBS\uff09\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u975eHilbert\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08\u5982\u5e26\u975e\u4e8c\u6b21\u8303\u6570\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u7ed3\u6784\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\u4e2d\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u5931\u6548\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u6761\u4ef6\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u518d\u751f\u6838\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08RKHS\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8bb8\u591a\u73b0\u4ee3\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982\u5e26\u975e\u4e8c\u6b21\u8303\u6570\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u7ed3\u6784\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u4f9d\u8d56Hilbert\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u800c\u4e00\u822cBanach\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u70b9\u8bc4\u4f30\u6cdb\u51fd\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u6216\u6838\u5b66\u4e60\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u62d3\u5c55\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u2018\u7279\u5f81\u518d\u751f\u6838Banach\u7a7a\u95f4\u2019\uff08FRKBS\uff09\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u523b\u753b\u5176\u7ed3\u6784\u6761\u4ef6\uff08\u5982\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u3001\u6838\u6784\u9020\u4e0e\u8868\u793a\u5b9a\u7406\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u7684\u5145\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff09\uff1b\u5c06\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6700\u5c0f\u8303\u6570\u63d2\u503c/\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u5411\u91cf\u503c\u60c5\u5f62\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u56fa\u5b9a\u7ed3\u6784\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u81ea\u7136\u8bf1\u5bfc\u6b64\u7c7b\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86Banach\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u6761\u4ef6\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\u5b9a\u7406\uff1b\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0e\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728FRKBS\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u5185\u5728\u8054\u7cfb\uff1b\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u6838\u5b66\u4e60\u539f\u7406\u5411\u975eHilbert\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u5e7f\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "conclusion": "FRKBS\u4e3a\u975eHilbertian\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u6807\u5fd7\u7740\u4eceRKHS\u5230\u66f4\u5e7f\u4e49\u518d\u751f\u6838\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8303\u5f0f\u62d3\u5c55\u3002"}}

It has wide applications like view synthesis, relighting, and scene editing. In recent years, inverse rendering methods have been inspired by view synthesis approaches like neural radiance fields and Gaussian splatting, which are capable of efficiently decomposing a scene into its geometry and radiance. They then further estimate the material and lighting that lead to the observed scene radiance. However, the latter step is highly ambiguous and prior works suffer from inaccurate color and baked shadows in their albedo estimation albeit their regularization. To this end, we propose RotLight, a simple capturing setup, to address the ambiguity. Compared to a usual capture, RotLight only requires the object to be rotated several times during the process. We show that as few as two rotations is effective in reducing artifacts. To further improve 2DGS-based inverse rendering, we additionally introduce a proxy mesh that not only allows accurate incident light tracing, but also enables a residual constraint and improves global illumination handling. We demonstrate with both synthetic and real world datasets that our method achieves superior albedo estimation while keeping efficient computation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faRotLight\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u65cb\u8f6c\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u91c7\u96c6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u548c\u5f15\u5165\u4ee3\u7406\u7f51\u683c\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u9006\u5411\u6e32\u67d3\u4e2d\u53cd\u7167\u7387\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u9634\u5f71\u70d8\u7119\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u53472DGS-based\u9006\u5411\u6e32\u67d3\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9006\u5411\u6e32\u67d3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4ece\u89c2\u6d4b\u8f90\u5c04\u4e2d\u4f30\u8ba1\u6750\u8d28\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u53cd\u7167\u7387\uff09\u548c\u5149\u7167\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6b67\u4e49\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u53cd\u7167\u7387\u989c\u8272\u4e0d\u51c6\u3001\u9634\u5f71\u88ab\u9519\u8bef\u2018\u70d8\u7119\u2019\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u4f7f\u7528\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4e5f\u96be\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRotLight\u91c7\u96c6\u65b9\u6848\u2014\u2014\u4ec5\u9700\u5728\u91c7\u96c6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5c06\u7269\u4f53\u65cb\u8f6c\u6570\u6b21\uff08\u6700\u5c11\u4e24\u6b21\uff09\uff1b\u5e76\u4e3a2DGS-based\u9006\u5411\u6e32\u67d3\u5f15\u5165\u4ee3\u7406\u7f51\u683c\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7cbe\u786e\u5165\u5c04\u5149\u8ffd\u8e2a\u3001\u65bd\u52a0\u6b8b\u5dee\u7ea6\u675f\u53ca\u6539\u5584\u5168\u5c40\u5149\u7167\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u53cd\u7167\u7387\u4f30\u8ba1\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u4e86\u989c\u8272\u5931\u771f\u4e0e\u70d8\u7119\u9634\u5f71\u7b49\u5e38\u89c1\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002", "conclusion": "RotLight\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9006\u5411\u6e32\u67d3\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6781\u7b80\u786c\u4ef6\u6539\u52a8\uff08\u65cb\u8f6c\uff09\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u8f85\u52a9\u5efa\u6a21\uff08\u4ee3\u7406\u7f51\u683c\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u8d28\u6027\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u6750\u8d28\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u6b67\u4e49\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper presents a generic function offloading framework that can be used to offload an arbitrary set of computational tasks with a focus on autonomous driving. To provide flexibility, the function offloading framework is designed to incorporate different offloading decision making algorithms and quality of service~(QoS) requirements that can be adjusted to different scenarios or the objectives of the CAVs. With a focus on the applicability, we propose an efficient location-based approach, where the decision whether tasks are processed locally or remotely depends on the location of the CAV. We apply the proposed framework on the use case of service-oriented trajectory planning, where we offload the trajectory planning task of CAVs to a Multi-Access Edge Computing~(MEC) server.

The stable locomotion of these models is limited to tilted surfaces, requiring gravitational energy. Various techniques, such as actuation through the ankle and hip joints, have been proposed to extend the applicability of these models to level ground and rough terrain with improved locomotion efficiency. However, most of these techniques rely on impulsive energy injection schemes and torsional springs, which are quite challenging to implement in a physical platform. Here, a new model is proposed, named triggering controlled ankle actuated compass gait (TC-AACG), which allows non-instantaneous compliant ankle pushoff. The proposed technique can be implemented in physical platforms via series elastic actuators (SEAs). Our systematic examination shows that the proposed approach extends the locomotion capabilities of a biped model compared to impulsive ankle pushoff approach. We provide extensive simulation analysis investigating the locomotion speed, mechanical cost of transport, and basin of attraction of the proposed model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u8e1d\u5173\u8282\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u88ab\u52a8\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u8d70\u6a21\u578b\uff08TC-AACG\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u77ac\u65f6\u3001\u67d4\u987a\u7684\u8e1d\u90e8\u63a8\u79bb\u5b9e\u73b0\u6c34\u5e73\u5730\u9762\u7a33\u5b9a\u884c\u8d70\uff0c\u53ef\u501f\u52a9\u4e32\u8054\u5f39\u6027\u6267\u884c\u5668\uff08SEA\uff09\u5728\u7269\u7406\u5e73\u53f0\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u8109\u51b2\u5f0f\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u88ab\u52a8\u52a8\u6001\u6b65\u884c\u5668\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u80fd\u5728\u659c\u5761\u4e0a\u7a33\u5b9a\u884c\u8d70\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u91cd\u529b\u4f9b\u80fd\uff1b\u4e3a\u62d3\u5c55\u81f3\u6c34\u5e73\u53ca\u590d\u6742\u5730\u5f62\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u6613\u7269\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u89e6\u53d1\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u8e1d\u5173\u8282\u9a71\u52a8\u578b\u7f57\u76d8\u6b65\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff08TC-AACG\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u975e\u77ac\u65f6\u67d4\u987a\u8e1d\u63a8\u79bb\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u4e32\u8054\u5f39\u6027\u6267\u884c\u5668\uff08SEA\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u4eff\u771f\u5206\u6790\u5176\u6b65\u6001\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "TC-AACG\u76f8\u6bd4\u8109\u51b2\u5f0f\u8e1d\u9a71\u52a8\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u884c\u8d70\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u6b65\u901f\u3001\u673a\u68b0\u8fd0\u8f93\u80fd\u8017\uff08CoT\uff09\u548c\u5438\u5f15\u57df\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "TC-AACG\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u6613\u7269\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u80fd\u6548\u7684\u8e1d\u9a71\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3a\u88ab\u52a8\u52a8\u6001\u6b65\u884c\u5668\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

We present TernaryLM, a 132M parameter transformer architecture that employs native 1-bit ternary quantization {-1, 0, +1} during training, achieving significant memory reduction without sacrificing language modeling capability. Unlike post-training quantization approaches that quantize pre-trained full-precision models, TernaryLM learns quantization-aware representations from scratch using straight-through estimators and adaptive per-layer scaling factors. Our experiments demonstrate: (1) validation perplexity of 58.42 on TinyStories; (2) downstream transfer with 82.47 percent F1 on MRPC paraphrase detection; (3) 2.4x memory reduction (498MB vs 1197MB) with comparable inference latency; and (4) stable training dynamics across diverse corpora. We provide layer-wise quantization analysis showing that middle transformer layers exhibit highest compatibility with extreme quantization, informing future non-uniform precision strategies.

In this work, we develop and evaluate a system that adaptively scaffolds cognitive engagement by dynamically selecting worked examples in two different ICAP modes: (active) Guided examples and (constructive) Buggy examples. We compare Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) as adaptive methods against a non-adaptive baseline method for selecting example type in a logic ITS. Our experiment with 113 students demonstrates that both adaptive policies significantly improved student performance on test problems. BKT yielded the largest improvement in posttest scores for low prior knowledge students, helping them catch up with their high prior knowledge peers, whereas DRL yielded significantly higher posttest scores among high prior knowledge students. This paper contributes new insights into the complex interactions of cognitive engagement and adaptivity and their results on learning outcomes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eICAP\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8ba4\u77e5\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u8c03\u8282\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u667a\u80fd\u8f85\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f0f\uff08\u4e3b\u52a8\uff09\u548c\u542b\u9519\u8bef\uff08\u5efa\u6784\uff09\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u77e5\u8bc6\u8ffd\u8e2a\uff08BKT\uff09\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DRL\uff09\u4e24\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e8c\u8005\u5747\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u751f\u6210\u7ee9\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u6c34\u5e73\u5b66\u751f\u6548\u679c\u5404\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6d3b\u52a8\u4ee5\u6fc0\u53d1\u6700\u4f18\u8ba4\u77e5\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u662f\u667a\u80fd\u8f85\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u8282\u8ba4\u77e5\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u4e24\u79cdICAP\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u4f8b\u9898\uff08\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f0f\u793a\u4f8b\u548c\u542b\u9519\u8bef\u793a\u4f8b\uff09\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u77e5\u8bc6\u8ffd\u8e2a\uff08BKT\uff09\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DRL\uff09\u4e0e\u975e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u903b\u8f91ITS\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u5747\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u751f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6210\u7ee9\uff1bBKT\u5bf9\u4f4e\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5b66\u751f\u540e\u6d4b\u6210\u7ee9\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u5927\uff0c\u52a9\u5176\u8ffd\u8d76\u9ad8\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5b66\u751f\uff1bDRL\u5219\u4f7f\u9ad8\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5b66\u751f\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u540e\u6d4b\u5206\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8ba4\u77e5\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u8c03\u8282\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u5b58\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5176\u6548\u679c\u56e0\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u6c34\u5e73\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3aITS\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

In many applications, the parameters being tuned come with a carefully engineered default configuration, and practitioners only want to deviate from this default when necessary. Standard BO, however, does not aim to minimize deviation from the default and, in practice, often pushes weakly relevant parameters to the boundary of the search space. This makes it difficult to distinguish between important and spurious changes and increases the burden of vetting recommendations when the optimization objective omits relevant operational considerations. We introduce BONSAI, a default-aware BO policy that prunes low-impact deviations from a default configuration while explicitly controlling the loss in acquisition value. BONSAI is compatible with a variety of acquisition functions, including expected improvement and upper confidence bound (GP-UCB). We theoretically bound the regret incurred by BONSAI, showing that, under certain conditions, it enjoys the same no-regret property as vanilla GP-UCB. Across many real-world applications, we empirically find that BONSAI substantially reduces the number of non-default parameters in recommended configurations while maintaining competitive optimization performance, with little effect on wall time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86BONSAI\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9ed8\u8ba4\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\uff08BO\uff09\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5bf9\u9ed8\u8ba4\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u504f\u79bb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u526a\u679d\u4f4e\u5f71\u54cd\u504f\u79bb\u5e76\u63a7\u5236\u91c7\u96c6\u503c\u635f\u5931\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u8003\u8651\u5bf9\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u9ed8\u8ba4\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u504f\u79bb\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u5f31\u76f8\u5173\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u65e0\u610f\u4e49\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u7684\u5ba1\u6838\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u5e76\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u91cd\u8981\u4e0e\u5197\u4f59\u53d8\u66f4\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBONSAI\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u9ed8\u8ba4\u611f\u77e5\u7684BO\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u526a\u679d\u4f4e\u5f71\u54cd\u53c2\u6570\u504f\u79bb\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u91c7\u96c6\u51fd\u6570\u503c\u635f\u5931\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u975e\u9ed8\u8ba4\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\uff1b\u517c\u5bb9EI\u3001GP-UCB\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u91c7\u96c6\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u7406\u8bba\u9057\u61be\u754c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0cBONSAI\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u63a8\u8350\u914d\u7f6e\u4e2d\u975e\u9ed8\u8ba4\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6BO\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "BONSAI\u5728\u517c\u987e\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u679c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u8350\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u517c\u987e\u9ed8\u8ba4\u504f\u597d\u4e0e\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

As a result, they provide limited support for retrieval scenarios that require fine-grained semantic reasoning, structured visual understanding, and domain-specific knowledge. In this work, we introduce CIRThan, a sketch+text Composed Image Retrieval dataset for Thangka imagery, a culturally grounded and knowledge-specific visual domain characterized by complex structures, dense symbolic elements, and domain-dependent semantic conventions. CIRThan contains 2,287 high-quality Thangka images, each paired with a human-drawn sketch and hierarchical textual descriptions at three semantic levels, enabling composed queries that jointly express structural intent and multi-level semantic specification. We provide standardized data splits, comprehensive dataset analysis, and benchmark evaluations of representative supervised and zero-shot CIR methods. Experimental results reveal that existing CIR approaches, largely developed for general-domain imagery, struggle to effectively align sketch-based abstractions and hierarchical textual semantics with fine-grained Thangka images, particularly without in-domain supervision. We believe CIRThan offers a valuable benchmark for advancing sketch+text CIR, hierarchical semantic modeling, and multimodal retrieval in cultural heritage and other knowledge-specific visual domains.

Barfoot", "Perla Maiolino"], "title": "Continuum Robot Localization using Distributed Time-of-Flight Sensors", "comment": null, "summary": "Localization and mapping of an environment are crucial tasks for any robot operating in unstructured environments. Time-of-flight (ToF) sensors (e.g.,~lidar) have proven useful in mobile robotics, where high-resolution sensors can be used for simultaneous localization and mapping. In soft and continuum robotics, however, these high-resolution sensors are too large for practical use. This, combined with the deformable nature of such robots, has resulted in continuum robot (CR) localization and mapping in unstructured environments being a largely untouched area. In this work, we present a localization technique for CRs that relies on small, low-resolution ToF sensors distributed along the length of the robot. By fusing measurement information with a robot shape prior, we show that accurate localization is possible despite each sensor experiencing frequent degenerate scenarios. We achieve an average localization error of 2.5cm in position and 7.2\u00b0 in rotation across all experimental conditions with a 53cm long robot. We demonstrate that the results are repeated across multiple environments, in both simulation and real-world experiments, and study robustness in the estimation to deviations in the prior map.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8f6f\u4f53\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff08CR\uff09\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6cbf\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u672c\u4f53\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u3001\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u98de\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff08ToF\uff09\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5f62\u72b6\u5148\u9a8c\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5e73\u57472.5cm\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8bef\u5dee\u548c7.2\u00b0\u65cb\u8f6c\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387ToF\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff08\u5982\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\uff09\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8f6f\u4f53\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e2d\u56e0\u4f53\u79ef\u8fc7\u5927\u800c\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\uff1b\u52a0\u4e4b\u5176\u5f62\u53d8\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4CR\u5728\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u5efa\u56fe\u4ecd\u5c5e\u672a\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6cbf\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u957f\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u3001\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387ToF\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u5404\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5f62\u72b6\u5148\u9a8c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5355\u4e2a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u9891\u7e41\u51fa\u73b0\u9000\u5316\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u572853cm\u957f\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u73af\u5883\uff08\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a2.5cm\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u65cb\u8f6c\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a7.2\u00b0\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5bf9\u5148\u9a8c\u5730\u56fe\u504f\u5dee\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387ToF\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4e0e\u5f62\u72b6\u5148\u9a8c\u878d\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fde\u7eed\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u4e3a\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Heuristic pruning methods are efficient but sensitive to activation outliers, while reconstruction-based approaches improve fidelity at the cost of heavy computation. In this work, we propose a lightweight post-training pruning framework based on first-order statistical properties of model weights and activations. During pruning, channel-wise statistics are used to calibrate magnitude-based importance scores, reducing bias from activation-dominated channels. After pruning, we apply an analytic energy compensation to correct distributional distortions caused by weight removal. Both steps operate without retraining, gradients, or second-order information. Experiments across multiple LLM families, sparsity patterns, and evaluation tasks show that the proposed approach improves pruning performance while maintaining computational cost comparable to heuristic methods. The results suggest that simple statistical corrections can be effective for post-training pruning of LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e00\u9636\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7LLM\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u526a\u679d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u901a\u9053\u7ea7\u7edf\u8ba1\u6821\u51c6\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5f97\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u89e3\u6790\u80fd\u91cf\u8865\u507f\u4fee\u6b63\u5206\u5e03\u5931\u771f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u68af\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u526a\u679d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u526a\u679d\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\u4f46\u5bf9\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u91cd\u6784\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u9ad8\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e00\u9636\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u526a\u679d\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5229\u7528\u901a\u9053\u7ea7\u7edf\u8ba1\u6821\u51c6\u5e45\u5ea6\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5f97\u5206\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e3b\u5bfc\u901a\u9053\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff1b2\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u89e3\u6790\u80fd\u91cf\u8865\u507f\u4fee\u6b63\u526a\u679d\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5931\u771f\uff1b\u5168\u7a0b\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u6216\u4e8c\u9636\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u5bb6\u65cf\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u526a\u679d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6821\u6b63\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347LLM\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u526a\u679d\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u514d\u8bad\u7ec3\u526a\u679d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Recent Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown promising potential for performing end-to-end KIE directly from document images. To enable a comprehensive and systematic evaluation across realistic and diverse application scenarios, we introduce UNIKIE-BENCH, a unified benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the KIE capabilities of LMMs. UNIKIE-BENCH consists of two complementary tracks: a constrained-category KIE track with scenario-predefined schemas that reflect practical application needs, and an open-category KIE track that extracts any key information that is explicitly present in the document. Experiments on 15 state-of-the-art LMMs reveal substantial performance degradation under diverse schema definitions, long-tail key fields, and complex layouts, along with pronounced performance disparities across different document types and scenarios.

In this work, we present RAPiD, a deterministic policy extraction framework that distills a pretrained diffusion-based planner into an efficient policy while eliminating diffusion sampling. Using score-regularized policy optimization, we leverage the score function of a pre-trained diffusion planner as a behavior prior to regularize policy learning. To promote safety and passenger comfort, the policy is optimized using a critic trained to imitate a predictive driver controller, providing dense, safety-focused supervision beyond conventional imitation learning. Evaluations demonstrate that RAPiD achieves competitive performance on closed-loop nuPlan scenarios with an 8x speedup over diffusion baselines, while achieving state-of-the-art generalization among learning-based planners on the interPlan benchmark.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown promise as automatic relevance assessors, but their reliability is still limited. Most existing approaches rely on zero-shot prompting or In-Context Learning (ICL) with a small number of labeled examples. However, standard ICL treats examples as independent instances and fails to explicitly capture the underlying relevance criteria of a topic, restricting its ability to generalize to unseen query-document pairs. To address this limitation, we introduce Relevance Context Learning (RCL), a novel framework that leverages human relevance judgements to explicitly model topic-specific relevance criteria. Rather than directly using labeled examples for in-context prediction, RCL first prompts an LLM (Instructor LLM) to analyze sets of judged query-document pairs and generate explicit narratives that describe what constitutes relevance for a given topic. These relevance narratives are then used as structured prompts to guide a second LLM (Assessor LLM) in producing relevance judgements. To evaluate RCL in a realistic data collection setting, we propose a hybrid pooling strategy in which a shallow depth-\\textit{k} pool from participating systems is judged by human assessors, while the remaining documents are labeled by LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that RCL substantially outperforms zero-shot prompting and consistently improves over standard ICL. Overall, our findings indicate that transforming relevance examples into explicit, context-aware relevance narratives is a more effective way of exploiting human judgements for LLM-based IR dataset construction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faRelevance Context Learning (RCL)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u4e3b\u9898\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u63cf\u8ff0\uff08relevance narratives\uff09\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u5176\u6307\u5bfc\u53e6\u4e00LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u52a8\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u5728IR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u81ea\u52a8\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5224\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u4e3b\u9898\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u9690\u542b\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u51c6\u5219\uff0c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u4e14\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRCL\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5148\u7528Instructor LLM\u5206\u6790\u5df2\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u67e5\u8be2-\u6587\u6863\u5bf9\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u63cf\u8ff0\u8be5\u4e3b\u9898\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u51c6\u5219\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u53d9\u4e8b\uff08relevance narratives\uff09\uff1b\u518d\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d9\u4e8b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfcAssessor LLM\u5b8c\u6210\u65b0\u67e5\u8be2-\u6587\u6863\u5bf9\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5224\u65ad\uff1b\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6df7\u5408\u6c60\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "RCL\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u6301\u7eed\u8d85\u8d8a\u6807\u51c6ICL\uff1b\u6240\u751f\u6210\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u53d9\u4e8b\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5229\u7528\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347LLM\u5728IR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u793a\u4f8b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u663e\u5f0f\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u53d9\u4e8b\uff0c\u662f\u6bd4\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528\u793a\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684LLM\u8f85\u52a9IR\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

In Stage I, prompts from DICES are reclassified into 14 safety domains (adapted from BEAVERTAILS) using Mistral 7B-Instruct-v0.3, retaining demographic metadata and expanding low-resource domains via Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct with SimHash-based deduplication, yielding 43,050 samples.

Most papers report a pass@1 score computed from a single run per task, assuming this gives a reliable performance estimate. We test this assumption by collecting 60,000 agentic trajectories on SWE-Bench-Verified, spanning three models and two scaffolds. We find substantial variance: single-run pass@1 estimates vary by 2.2 to 6.0 percentage points depending on which run is selected, with standard deviations exceeding 1.5 percentage points even at temperature 0. This variance has critical implications: reported improvements of 2--3 percentage points may reflect evaluation noise rather than genuine algorithmic progress. Through token-level analysis, we show that trajectories diverge early, often within the first few percent of tokens, and that these small differences cascade into different solution strategies. To enable reliable evaluation of agentic systems, we recommend three concrete practices: (1) estimate pass@1 from multiple independent runs per task, especially when measuring small improvements, (2) use statistical power analysis to determine the number of runs needed to detect expected effect sizes, and (3) consider metrics like pass@k (optimistic bound) and pass^k (pessimistic bound) with k>1 to better characterize the full performance envelope.

Despite the progress, existing approaches typically rely on static, decoupled tokenization that ignores collaborative signals. While recent methods attempt to integrate collaborative signals into item identifiers either during index construction or through end-to-end modeling, they encounter significant challenges in real-world production environments. Specifically, the volatility of collaborative signals leads to unstable tokenization, and current end-to-end strategies often devolve into suboptimal two-stage training rather than achieving true co-evolution. To bridge this gap, we propose PIT, a dynamic Personalized Item Tokenizer framework for end-to-end generative recommendation, which employs a co-generative architecture that harmonizes collaborative patterns through collaborative signal alignment and synchronizes item tokenizer with generative recommender via a co-evolution learning. This enables the dynamic, joint, end-to-end evolution of both index construction and recommendation.

Introducing greater autonomy to these systems can simultaneously make them more effective as well as reliable. Thus, the ability to rapidly engineer and deploy autonomous aerial systems has become of strategic importance. In the 2010s, a combination of high-performance compute, data, and open-source software led to the current deep learning and AI boom, unlocking decades of prior theoretical work. Robotics is on the cusp of a similar transformation. However, physical AI faces unique hurdles, often combined under the umbrella term \"simulation-to-reality gap\". These span from modeling shortcomings to the complexity of vertically integrating the highly heterogeneous hardware and software systems typically found in field robots. To address the latter, we introduce aerial-autonomy-stack, an open-source, end-to-end framework designed to streamline the pipeline from (GPU-accelerated) perception to (flight controller-based) action. Our stack allows the development of aerial autonomy using ROS2 and provides a common interface for two of the most popular autopilots: PX4 and ArduPilot.

Existing works use Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to align LLMs. However, these works face challenges in multi-objective settings, such as SFT leading to interference between conflicting objectives, while MoEs suffer from miscalibrated routing. We term this failure mode Axis Collapse, marked by (1) disjoint feature spaces causing catastrophic forgetting, and (2) unreliable inference from misrouted experts. To resolve this, we propose AlignX, a two-stage framework. Stage 1 uses prompt-injected fine-tuning to extract axis-specific task features, mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Stage 2 deploys a MoCaE module that calibrates expert routing using fractal and natural geometry, improving inference reliability. AlignX achieves significant gains on Alpaca (Helpfulness), BeaverTails (Harmlessness), and TruthfulQA (Honesty), with +171.5% win rate, +110.1% in truthfulness-informativeness, and 4.3% fewer safety violations. It also reduces latency and memory usage by over 35% compared to prior MoEs.

Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited First Published in Proceedings of the 2024 SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM24), published by the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM)", "summary": "Identifying out-of-distribution (OOD) data at inference time is crucial for many machine learning applications, especially for automation. We present a novel unsupervised semi-parametric framework COMBOOD for OOD detection with respect to image recognition. Our framework combines signals from two distance metrics, nearest-neighbor and Mahalanobis, to derive a confidence score for an inference point to be out-of-distribution. The former provides a non-parametric approach to OOD detection. The latter provides a parametric, simple, yet effective method for detecting OOD data points, especially, in the far OOD scenario, where the inference point is far apart from the training data set in the embedding space. However, its performance is not satisfactory in the near OOD scenarios that arise in practical situations. Our COMBOOD framework combines the two signals in a semi-parametric setting to provide a confidence score that is accurate both for the near-OOD and far-OOD scenarios. We show experimental results with the COMBOOD framework for different types of feature extraction strategies.

While recent efforts have successfully enhanced these agents by scaling depth through increasing the number of sequential thinking and tool calls, the potential of scaling width via parallel tool calling remains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose the Wide and Deep research agent, a framework designed to investigate the behavior and performance of agents when scaling not only depth but also width via parallel tool calling. Unlike existing approaches that rely on complex multi-agent orchestration to parallelize workloads, our method leverages intrinsic parallel tool calling to facilitate effective coordination within a single reasoning step. We demonstrate that scaling width significantly improves performance on deep research benchmarks while reducing the number of turns required to obtain correct answers. Furthermore, we analyze the factors driving these improvements through case studies and explore various tool call schedulers to optimize parallel tool calling strategy. Our findings suggest that optimizing the trade-off between width and depth is a critical pathway toward high-efficiency deep research agents.

The double robustness and the propensity score matching for the inclusion of data domains make matching more robust than naive pooling and uniform subsampling by filtering out the confounding domains (the main cause of heterogeneity). Theoretical and empirical analyses show that, unlike naive pooling or uniform subsampling, matching achieves better results under asymmetric meta-distributions, which are also extended to non-Gaussian and multimodal real-world settings.

In this paper, we challenge the necessity of uninformed noise sampling and propose Action-to-Action flow matching (A2A), a novel policy paradigm that shifts from random sampling to initialization informed by the previous action. Unlike existing methods that treat proprioceptive action feedback as static conditions, A2A leverages historical proprioceptive sequences, embedding them into a high-dimensional latent space as the starting point for action generation. This design bypasses costly iterative denoising while effectively capturing the robot's physical dynamics and temporal continuity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that A2A exhibits high training efficiency, fast inference speed, and improved generalization. Notably, A2A enables high-quality action generation in as few as a single inference step (0.56 ms latency), and exhibits superior robustness to visual perturbations and enhanced generalization to unseen configurations. Lastly, we also extend A2A to video generation, demonstrating its broader versatility in temporal modeling.

We propose a framework to enhance extractive neural summarization models by incorporating domain-specific pre-trained encoders tailored for legal texts. Further, we explore the injection of legal domain knowledge into generative models (including Large Language Models) through continual pre-training on large legal corpora in English and Hindi. Our proposed approaches achieve statistically significant improvements in both English-to-English and English-to-Hindi Indian legal document summarization, as measured by standard evaluation metrics, factual consistency metrics, and legal domain-specific metrics.

Though its effect is much smaller than spatial mixing initializations, it can be used in conjunction with them for an additional positive effect.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06mimetic\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u901a\u9053\u6df7\u5408\u5c42\uff08\u5982MLP\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5373\u4e3a\u7b2c\u4e00\u5c42\u8d4b\u4e88\u975e\u96f6\u5747\u503c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u52a0\u901f\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709mimetic\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4ec5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u7a7a\u95f4\u6df7\u5408\u5c42\uff08\u5982\u5377\u79ef\u3001\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u3001\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c42\uff09\uff0c\u5c1a\u672a\u62d3\u5c55\u81f3\u901a\u9053\u6df7\u5408\u5c42\uff08\u5982MLP\uff09\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6781\u7b80\u7684MLP mimetic\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff1a\u4e3aMLP\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u5c42\u6743\u91cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u975e\u96f6\u5747\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728CIFAR-10\u548cImageNet-1k\u7b49\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u52a0\u5feb\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\uff1b\u6548\u679c\u867d\u5f31\u4e8e\u7a7a\u95f4\u6df7\u5408\u5c42\u7684mimetic\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u4e0e\u4e4b\u7ed3\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u989d\u5916\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "mimetic\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u53ef\u6210\u529f\u62d3\u5c55\u81f3\u901a\u9053\u6df7\u5408\u5c42\uff08MLP\uff09\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

This work demonstrates that reliable multifingered grasping can be achieved under extremely minimal sensing by relying solely on uniaxial fingertip force feedback and joint proprioception, without vision or multi-axis/tactile sensing. To enable such blind grasping, we employ an efficient teacher-student training pipeline in which a reinforcement-learned teacher exploits privileged simulation-only observations to generate demonstrations for distilling a transformer-based student policy operating under partial observation. The student policy is trained to act using only sensing modalities available at real-world deployment. We validate the proposed approach on real hardware across 18 objects, including both in-distribution and out-of-distribution cases, achieving a 98.3~$\\%$ overall grasp success rate. These results demonstrate strong robustness and generalization beyond the simulation training distribution, while significantly reducing sensing requirements for real-world grasping systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u8f74\u6307\u5c16\u529b\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u5173\u8282\u672c\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u76f2\u6293\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6559\u5e08-\u5b66\u751f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4eff\u771f\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u572818\u4e2a\u7269\u4f53\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523098.3%\u6293\u53d6\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6293\u53d6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d7\u9650\u4f20\u611f\uff08\u5982\u7f3a\u4e4f\u89c6\u89c9\u6216\u591a\u8f74\u89e6\u89c9\uff09\u5bfc\u81f4\u6293\u53d6\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u800c\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5b58\u5728\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u6613\u635f\u574f\u548c\u96c6\u6210\u590d\u6742\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6559\u5e08\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5229\u7528\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u7279\u6743\u4fe1\u606f\u751f\u6210\u793a\u8303\uff09\uff0c\u84b8\u998f\u4e3a\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u8f74\u529b\u4e0e\u5173\u8282\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684Transformer\u5b66\u751f\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u5168\u7a0b\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u90e8\u7f72\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u591a\u6307\u624b\u3002", "result": "\u572818\u4e2a\u7269\u4f53\uff08\u542b\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u5916\uff09\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u786c\u4ef6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f9798.3%\u6574\u4f53\u6293\u53d6\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ec5\u9700\u6781\u7b80\u4f20\u611f\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6210\u529f\u7387\u591a\u6307\u6293\u53d6\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4f4e\u611f\u77e5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6293\u53d6\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, existing remote sensing (RS) benchmarks remain heavily biased toward perception tasks, such as object recognition and scene classification. This limitation hinders the development of MLLMs for cognitively demanding RS applications. To address this, , we propose a Vision Language ReaSoning Benchmark (VLRS-Bench), which is the first benchmark exclusively dedicated to complex RS reasoning. Structured across the three core dimensions of Cognition, Decision, and Prediction, VLRS-Bench comprises 2,000 question-answer pairs with an average length of 71 words, spanning 14 tasks and up to eight temporal phases. VLRS-Bench is constructed via a specialized pipeline that integrates RS-specific priors and expert knowledge to ensure geospatial realism and reasoning complexity.

Inspired by their design, we have proposed for the first time ICL using transformer models applicable to motor feedforward control, a critical task where classical PI and physics-based methods struggle with nonlinearities and complex load conditions. We propose a transformer based model architecture that separates signal representation from system behavior, enabling both few-shot finetuning and one-shot ICL. Pretrained on a large corpus of synthetic linear and nonlinear systems, the model learns to generalize to unseen system dynamics of real-world motors only with a handful of examples. In experiments, our approach generalizes across multiple motor load configurations, transforms untuned examples into accurate feedforward predictions, and outperforms PI controllers and physics-based feedforward baselines.

Despite its potential, current approaches typically rely on the next-token prediction schema, which treats each token of the next interacted items as the sole target. This narrow focus 1) limits their ability to capture the nuanced structure of user preferences, and 2) overlooks the deep interaction between decoded identifiers and user behavior sequences. In response to these challenges, we propose RankGR, a Rank-enhanced Generative Retrieval method that incorporates listwise direct preference optimization for recommendation. RankGR decomposes the retrieval process into two complementary stages: the Initial Assessment Phase (IAP) and the Refined Scoring Phase (RSP). In IAP, we incorporate a novel listwise direct preference optimization strategy into GR, thus facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of the hierarchical user preferences and more effective partial-order modeling. The RSP then refines the top-\u03bb candidates generated by IAP with interactions towards input sequences using a lightweight scoring module, leading to more precise candidate evaluation.

Safe locomotion in these settings requires long-horizon goal progress, passability over uneven terrain and static constraints, and collision avoidance against high-speed dynamic obstacles. A single system cannot fully satisfy all three objectives simultaneously: planning-based decisions can be too slow, while purely reactive decisions can sacrifice goal progress and passability. To resolve this conflict, we propose UEREBot (Unstructured-Environment Reflexive Evasion Robot), a hierarchical framework that separates slow planning from instantaneous reflexive evasion and coordinates them during execution. UEREBot formulates the task as a constrained optimal control problem blueprint. It adopts a spatial--temporal planner that provides reference guidance toward the goal and threat signals. It then uses a threat-aware handoff to fuse navigation and reflex actions into a nominal command, and a control barrier function shield as a final execution safeguard. We evaluate UEREBot in Isaac Lab simulation and deploy it on a Unitree Go2 quadruped equipped with onboard perception. Across diverse environments with complex static structure and high-speed dynamic obstacles, UEREBot achieves higher avoidance success and more stable locomotion while maintaining goal progress than representative baselines, demonstrating improved safety--progress trade-offs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faUEREBot\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u878d\u5408\u6162\u901f\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u77ac\u65f6\u53cd\u5c04\u89c4\u907f\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u56db\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "motivation": "\u56db\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9700\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u76ee\u6807\u63a8\u8fdb\u3001\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u5730\u5f62\u901a\u884c\u6027\u53ca\u9ad8\u901f\u52a8\u6001\u969c\u788d\u7269\u907f\u649e\uff0c\u4f46\u5355\u4e00\u7cfb\u7edf\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u4e09\u8005\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u89c4\u5212\u8fc7\u6162\u6216\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u7b56\u7565\u727a\u7272\u76ee\u6807\u8fdb\u5ea6\u4e0e\u901a\u884c\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u6846\u67b6UEREBot\uff1a1\uff09\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5e26\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u84dd\u56fe\uff1b2\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u65f6\u7a7a\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u751f\u6210\u671d\u5411\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0e\u5a01\u80c1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b3\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5a01\u80c1\u611f\u77e5\u4ea4\u63a5\u673a\u5236\u878d\u5408\u5bfc\u822a\u4e0e\u53cd\u5c04\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u6807\u79f0\u6307\u4ee4\uff1b4\uff09\u5229\u7528\u63a7\u5236\u5c4f\u969c\u51fd\u6570\uff08CBF\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6700\u7ec8\u6267\u884c\u4fdd\u969c\u3002", "result": "\u5728Isaac Lab\u4eff\u771f\u53ca\u642d\u8f7d\u673a\u8f7d\u611f\u77e5\u7684Unitree Go2\u5b9e\u673a\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cUEREBot\u5728\u542b\u590d\u6742\u9759\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u9ad8\u901f\u52a8\u6001\u969c\u788d\u7684\u591a\u6837\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u907f\u969c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u53ca\u76ee\u6807\u8fdb\u5ea6\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "UEREBot\u6709\u6548\u534f\u8c03\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u53cd\u5c04\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u4f18\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u56db\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

We ask a concrete question: when the generation paradigm is changed but the agent framework and supervision are held fixed, do diffusion backbones induce systematically different planning and tool-use behaviors, and do these differences translate into end-to-end efficiency gains? We study this in a controlled setting by instantiating DLLM and AR backbones within the same agent workflow (DeepDiver) and performing matched agent-oriented fine-tuning on the same trajectory data, yielding diffusion-backed DLLM Agents and directly comparable AR agents. Across benchmarks and case studies, we find that, at comparable accuracy, DLLM Agents are on average over 30% faster end to end than AR agents, with some cases exceeding 8x speedup. Conditioned on correct task completion, DLLM Agents also require fewer interaction rounds and tool invocations, consistent with higher planner hit rates that converge earlier to a correct action path with less backtracking. We further identify two practical considerations for deploying diffusion backbones in tool-using agents. First, naive DLLM policies are more prone to structured tool-call failures, necessitating stronger tool-call-specific training to emit valid schemas and arguments. Second, for multi-turn inputs interleaving context and action spans, diffusion-style span corruption requires aligned attention masking to avoid spurious context-action information flow; without such alignment, performance degrades. Finally, we analyze attention dynamics across workflow stages and observe paradigm-specific coordination patterns, suggesting stronger global planning signals in diffusion-backed agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08DLLMs\uff09\u5728\u4ee3\u7406\u5f0f\u591a\u6b65\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\uff08AR\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6548\u7387\uff08\u5e73\u5747\u5feb30%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe8\u500d\uff09\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4ea4\u4e92\u8f6e\u6b21\u4e0e\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86DLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u89c4\u5212\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0a\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7279\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5f53\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u56fa\u5b9a\u65f6\uff0c\u4ec5\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u8303\u5f0f\u4ece\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5207\u6362\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\uff0c\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u5e26\u6765\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6548\u7387\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6DeepDiver\u4e2d\u5206\u522b\u96c6\u6210DLLM\u4e0eAR\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5339\u914d\u7684\u9762\u5411\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001\u6848\u4f8b\u5206\u6790\u3001\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a9\u7801\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53ca\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\u5f00\u5c55\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "DLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u540c\u7b49\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u901f\u5ea6\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u8d8530%\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u573a\u666f\u8fbe8\u500d\uff1b\u6210\u529f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4ea4\u4e92\u8f6e\u6b21\u4e0e\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u66f4\u5c11\uff0c\u89c4\u5212\u547d\u4e2d\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u3001\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\uff1b\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u6613\u5931\u8d25\u3001\u591a\u8f6e\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\u9700\u5bf9\u9f50\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a9\u7801\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793aDLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u89c4\u5212\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "conclusion": "DLLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406\u9aa8\u5e72\u5177\u5907\u663e\u8457\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u89c4\u5212\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u5efa\u6a21\uff1b\u5176\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8eAR\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u534f\u540c\u89c4\u5212\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Amparore", "Enrico Ferrari", "Damiano Verda"], "title": "ShapBPT: Image Feature Attributions Using Data-Aware Binary Partition Trees", "comment": "AAAI-2026", "summary": "Pixel-level feature attributions are an important tool in eXplainable AI for Computer Vision (XCV), providing visual insights into how image features influence model predictions. The Owen formula for hierarchical Shapley values has been widely used to interpret machine learning (ML) models and their learned representations. However, existing hierarchical Shapley approaches do not exploit the multiscale structure of image data, leading to slow convergence and weak alignment with the actual morphological features. Moreover, no prior Shapley method has leveraged data-aware hierarchies for Computer Vision tasks, leaving a gap in model interpretability of structured visual data. To address this, this paper introduces ShapBPT, a novel data-aware XCV method based on the hierarchical Shapley formula. ShapBPT assigns Shapley coefficients to a multiscale hierarchical structure tailored for images, the Binary Partition Tree (BPT). By using this data-aware hierarchical partitioning, ShapBPT ensures that feature attributions align with intrinsic image morphology, effectively prioritizing relevant regions while reducing computational overhead. This advancement connects hierarchical Shapley methods with image data, providing a more efficient and semantically meaningful approach to visual interpretability.

Recent advances in generative recommendation unify the multi-stage recommendation process with Transformer-based architectures, offering improved scalability and higher computational efficiency. However, the inherent complexity of live-streaming prevents the direct transfer of these methods to live-streaming scenario, where continuously evolving content, limited lifecycles, strict real-time constraints, and heterogeneous multi-objectives introduce unique challenges that invalidate static tokenization and conventional model framework. To address these issues, we propose OneLive, a dynamically unified generative recommendation framework tailored for live-streaming scenario.

However, in long-horizon tasks, visually similar observations often recur across execution stages while requiring distinct actions, which leads to ambiguous predictions when policies are conditioned only on instantaneous observations, termed multi-modal action ambiguity (MA2). To address this challenge, we propose the Trace-Focused Diffusion Policy (TF-DP), a simple yet effective diffusion-based framework that explicitly conditions action generation on the robot's execution history. TF-DP represents historical motion as an explicit execution trace and projects it into the visual observation space, providing stage-aware context when current observations alone are insufficient. In addition, the induced trace-focused field emphasizes task-relevant regions associated with historical motion, improving robustness to background visual disturbances. We evaluate TF-DP on real-world robotic manipulation tasks exhibiting pronounced multi-modal action ambiguity and visually cluttered conditions. Experimental results show that TF-DP improves temporal consistency and robustness, outperforming the vanilla diffusion policy by 80.56 percent on tasks with multi-modal action ambiguity and by 86.11 percent under visual disturbances, while maintaining inference efficiency with only a 6.4 percent runtime increase. These results demonstrate that execution-trace conditioning offers a scalable and principled approach for robust long-horizon robotic manipulation within a single policy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aTrace-Focused Diffusion Policy (TF-DP)\u7684\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u663e\u5f0f\u5730\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6267\u884c\u5386\u53f2\uff08\u5373\u6267\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\uff09\uff0c\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u56e0\u89c6\u89c9\u89c2\u6d4b\u76f8\u4f3c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6b67\u4e49\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u5e26\u6765\u8f7b\u5fae\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6267\u884c\u9636\u6bb5\u9700\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5f53\u524d\u89c2\u6d4b\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u52a8\u4f5c\u9884\u6d4b\u6b67\u4e49\uff08MA2\uff09\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u7b56\u7565\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u6267\u884c\u5386\u53f2\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTF-DP\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5c06\u5386\u53f2\u8fd0\u52a8\u663e\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u6267\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u6295\u5f71\u81f3\u89c6\u89c9\u89c2\u6d4b\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u9636\u6bb5\u611f\u77e5\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5f15\u5165\u8f68\u8ff9\u805a\u7126\u573a\uff08trace-focused field\uff09\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u533a\u57df\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u80cc\u666f\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457MA2\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u6742\u4e71\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cTF-DP\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7840\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u5728MA2\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534780.56%\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u5e72\u6270\u4e0b\u63d0\u534786.11%\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u4ec5\u589e\u52a06.4%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6267\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u6709\u539f\u5219\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5355\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

However, the conventional SFT process, driven by Cross-Entropy (CE) loss, often induces mode collapse, where models over-concentrate on specific response patterns. This lack of distributional diversity severely restricts the exploration efficiency required for subsequent RL. While recent studies have attempted to improve SFT by replacing the CE loss, aiming to preserve diversity or refine the update policy, they fail to adequately balance diversity and accuracy, thereby yielding suboptimal performance after RL. To address the mode collapse problem, we propose SED-SFT, which adaptively encourages diversity based on the token exploration space. This framework introduces a selective entropy regularization term with a selective masking mechanism into the optimization objective. Extensive experiments across eight mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that SED-SFT significantly enhances generation diversity with a negligible computational overhead increase compared with CE loss, yielding average improvements of 2.06 and 1.20 points in subsequent RL performance over standard CE-based baselines on Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct, respectively.

Doing it on edge hardware improves privacy and lowers latency, but entails memory constraints. To address this, we propose Error-enhanced Contrastive Handwriting Recognition (ECHWR), a training framework designed to improve feature representation and recognition accuracy without increasing inference costs. ECHWR utilizes a temporary auxiliary branch that aligns sensor signals with semantic text embeddings during the training phase. This alignment is maintained through a dual contrastive objective: an in-batch contrastive loss for general modality alignment and a novel error-based contrastive loss that distinguishes between correct signals and synthetic hard negatives. The auxiliary branch is discarded after training, which allows the deployed model to keep its original, efficient architecture. Evaluations on the OnHW-Words500 dataset show that ECHWR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, reducing character error rates by up to 7.4% on the writer-independent split and 10.4% on the writer-dependent split.

Analyzing AI and Human Behavior Alignment in Dispute Resolution", "comment": "AAAI 2026 (Special Track: AISI)", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate human behavior in social settings such as legal mediation, negotiation, and dispute resolution. However, it remains unclear whether these simulations reproduce the personality-behavior patterns observed in humans. Human personality, for instance, shapes how individuals navigate social interactions, including strategic choices and behaviors in emotionally charged interactions. This raises the question: Can LLMs, when prompted with personality traits, reproduce personality-driven differences in human conflict behavior? To explore this, we introduce an evaluation framework that enables direct comparison of human-human and LLM-LLM behaviors in dispute resolution dialogues with respect to Big Five Inventory (BFI) personality traits. This framework provides a set of interpretable metrics related to strategic behavior and conflict outcomes. We additionally contribute a novel dataset creation methodology for LLM dispute resolution dialogues with matched scenarios and personality traits with respect to human conversations. Finally, we demonstrate the use of our evaluation framework with three contemporary closed-source LLMs and show significant divergences in how personality manifests in conflict across different LLMs compared to human data, challenging the assumption that personality-prompted agents can serve as reliable behavioral proxies in socially impactful applications.

A key advantage of these models is that they can be trained exclusively on linear elastic data and then generalized to nonlinear inelastic regimes during online prediction. Despite their growing adoption, systematic evaluations of their performance across the full offline-online pipeline remain limited. This work presents a comprehensive comparative assessment of DMNs with respect to prediction accuracy, computational efficiency, and training robustness. We investigate the effects of offline training choices, including initialization, batch size, training data size, and activation regularization on online generalization performance and uncertainty. The results demonstrate that both prediction error and variance decrease with increasing training data size, while initialization and batch size can significantly influence model performance. Moreover, activation regularization is shown to play a critical role in controlling network complexity and therefore generalization performance. Compared with the original DMN, the rotation-free Interaction-based Material Network (IMN) formulation achieves a 3.4x - 4.7x speed-up in offline training, while maintaining comparable online prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.

However, these design choices require significant data and computational resources and remain far from reliable, particularly within the context of multi-fingered dexterous manipulation. Fundamentally, they model skills as reactive mappings and rely on fixed-horizon action chunking to mitigate jitter, creating a rigid trade-off between temporal coherence and reactivity. In this work, we introduce Unified Behavioral Models (UBMs), a framework that learns to represent dexterous skills as coupled dynamical systems that capture how visual features of the environment (visual flow) and proprioceptive states of the robot (action flow) co-evolve. By capturing such behavioral dynamics, UBMs can ensure temporal coherence by construction rather than by heuristic averaging. To operationalize these models, we propose Koopman-UBM, a first instantiation of UBMs that leverages Koopman Operator theory to effectively learn a unified representation in which the joint flow of latent visual and proprioceptive features is governed by a structured linear system. We demonstrate that Koopman-UBM can be viewed as an implicit planner: given an initial condition, it analytically computes the desired robot behavior while simultaneously ''imagining'' the resulting flow of visual features over the entire skill horizon. To enable reactivity and adaptation, we introduce an online replanning strategy in which the model acts as its own runtime monitor that automatically triggers replanning when predicted and observed visual flow diverge beyond a threshold. Across seven simulated tasks and two real-world tasks, we demonstrate that K-UBM matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art baselines, while offering considerably faster inference, smooth execution, robustness to occlusions, and flexible replanning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\uff08UBMs\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Koopman\u7b97\u5b50\u7406\u8bba\u5efa\u6a21\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u672c\u4f53\u611f\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8054\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u5757\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u53ef\u5728\u7ebf\u91cd\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u6280\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563/Transformer\u7684\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u65f6\u957f\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u5757\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65f6\u5e8f\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u4e0e\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u591a\u6307\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4f4e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\uff08UBMs\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u7075\u5de7\u6280\u80fd\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u6d41\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u6d41\u8026\u5408\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1b\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u73b0Koopman-UBM\uff0c\u5229\u7528Koopman\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8054\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u6d41\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u91cd\u89c4\u5212\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u57287\u4e2a\u4eff\u771f\u4efb\u52a1\u548c2\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cKoopman-UBM\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8e\u6216\u8d85\u8d8aSOTA\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u5907\u66f4\u5feb\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u6267\u884c\u3001\u66f4\u5f3a\u906e\u6321\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u53ca\u7075\u6d3b\u91cd\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "UBMs\u4e3a\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u672c\u8d28\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u6280\u80fd\u89c6\u4e3a\u5185\u5728\u8026\u5408\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u800c\u975e\u9759\u6001\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u4e0e\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u77db\u76fe\u3002"}}

This limits their fairness and cross-cultural robustness in tasks like hateful meme detection. We introduce a systematic evaluation framework designed to diagnose and quantify the cross-cultural robustness of state-of-the-art VLMs across multilingual meme datasets, analyzing three axes: (i) learning strategy (zero-shot vs. one-shot), (ii) prompting language (native vs. English), and (iii) translation effects on meaning and detection. Results show that the common ``translate-then-detect'' approach deteriorate performance, while culturally aligned interventions - native-language prompting and one-shot learning - significantly enhance detection. Our findings reveal systematic convergence toward Western safety norms and provide actionable strategies to mitigate such bias, guiding the design of globally robust multimodal moderation systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8ff7\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8de8\u6587\u5316\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u539f\u751f\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u4e0e\u5355\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4ec7\u6068\u8ff7\u56e0\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u800c\u201c\u7ffb\u8bd1\u540e\u68c0\u6d4b\u201d\u7b56\u7565\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6587\u5316\u80cc\u666f\u6df1\u523b\u5f71\u54cd\u4eba\u4eec\u5bf9\u7f51\u7edc\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u4e3b\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u897f\u65b9\u6216\u82f1\u8bed\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u89d2\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5176\u5728\u4ec7\u6068\u8ff7\u56e0\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u6587\u5316\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8ff7\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4ece\u4e09\u65b9\u9762\u5206\u6790VLMs\u7684\u8de8\u6587\u5316\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1a(i) \u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u96f6\u6837\u672c vs. \u5355\u6837\u672c\uff09\uff0c(ii) \u63d0\u793a\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u6bcd\u8bed vs. \u82f1\u8bed\uff09\uff0c(iii) \u7ffb\u8bd1\u5bf9\u8bed\u4e49\u53ca\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u2018\u7ffb\u8bd1\u540e\u68c0\u6d4b\u2019\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u800c\u91c7\u7528\u6bcd\u8bed\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u5355\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u6587\u5316\u9002\u914d\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u5219\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5411\u897f\u65b9\u5b89\u5168\u89c4\u8303\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6536\u655b\u7684\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e94\u907f\u514d\u7b80\u5355\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8f6c\u800c\u91c7\u7528\u6587\u5316\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08\u5982\u6bcd\u8bed\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u5c11\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5168\u7403\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5185\u5bb9\u5ba1\u6838\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002"}}

While modern video world models achieve strong performance on intuitive physics benchmarks, it remains unclear which of these representational regimes they implement internally. Here, we present the first interpretability study to directly examine physical representations inside large-scale video encoders. Using layerwise probing, subspace geometry, patch-level decoding, and targeted attention ablations, we characterize where physical information becomes accessible and how it is organized within encoder-based video transformers.\n  Across architectures, we identify a sharp intermediate-depth transition -- which we call the Physics Emergence Zone -- at which physical variables become accessible. Physics-related representations peak shortly after this transition and degrade toward the output layers. Decomposing motion into explicit variables, we find that scalar quantities such as speed and acceleration are available from early layers onwards, whereas motion direction becomes accessible only at the Physics Emergence Zone. Notably, we find that direction is encoded through a high-dimensional population structure with circular geometry, requiring coordinated multi-feature intervention to control. These findings suggest that modern video models do not use factorized representations of physical variables like a classical physics engine. Instead, they use a distributed representation that is nonetheless sufficient for making physical predictions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u76f4\u63a5\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u7269\u7406\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u2018\u7269\u7406\u6d8c\u73b0\u533a\u2019\uff0c\u7269\u7406\u53d8\u91cf\u5728\u6b64\u533a\u57df\u53d8\u5f97\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u800c\u975e\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u65b9\u5f0f\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u9700\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u7684\u7269\u7406\u53d8\u91cf\u8868\u5f81\u624d\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u7269\u7406\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u80fd\u4ee5\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u65b9\u5f0f\u8868\u5f81\u7269\u7406\u53d8\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u9010\u5c42\u63a2\u6d4b\u3001\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u6790\u3001\u5757\u7ea7\u89e3\u7801\u548c\u5b9a\u5411\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6d88\u878d\u7b49\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u89c6\u9891Transformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e2d\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0e\u7ec4\u7ec7\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u8de8\u67b6\u6784\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e2d\u95f4\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u2018\u7269\u7406\u6d8c\u73b0\u533a\u2019\uff0c\u7269\u7406\u53d8\u91cf\u5728\u6b64\u7a81\u7136\u53d8\u5f97\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\uff1b\u6807\u91cf\u7269\u7406\u91cf\uff08\u5982\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\uff09\u5728\u6d45\u5c42\u5373\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u800c\u8fd0\u52a8\u65b9\u5411\u4ec5\u5728\u8be5\u533a\u57df\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u9ad8\u7ef4\u73af\u5f62\u7fa4\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u7f16\u7801\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7ecf\u5178\u7269\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\u7684\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u7269\u7406\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u91c7\u7528\u4e00\u79cd\u867d\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4f46\u8db3\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u7269\u7406\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002"}}

We show that these viral narratives were overwhelmingly human-driven. Exploiting an architectural feature of the OpenClaw agent framework--a periodic \"heartbeat\" cycle that produces regular posting intervals for autonomous agents but is disrupted by human prompting--we develop a temporal fingerprinting method based on the coefficient of variation of inter-post intervals. This signal converges with independent content, ownership, and network indicators across 91,792 posts and 405,707 comments from 22,020 agents. No viral phenomenon originated from a clearly autonomous agent; three of six traced to accounts with irregular temporal signatures characteristic of human intervention, one showed mixed patterns, and two had insufficient posting history for classification. A 44-hour platform shutdown provided a natural experiment: human-influenced agents returned first (87.7% of early reconnectors), confirming that the token reset differentially affected autonomous versus human-operated agents. We further document industrial-scale bot farming (four accounts producing 32% of all comments with 12-second coordination gaps) and rapid decay of human influence through reply chains (half-life: 0.65 conversation depths).

However, safety concerns remain when these methods are deployed on real-world applications, necessitating risk-aware agents. A common utility for learning such risk-aware agents is the entropic risk measure, but current policy gradient methods optimizing this measure must perform high-variance and numerically unstable updates. As a result, existing risk-sensitive model-free approaches are limited to simple tasks and tabular settings. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive theoretical justification for policy gradient methods on the entropic risk measure, including on- and off-policy gradient theorems for the stochastic and deterministic policy settings. Motivated by theory, we propose risk-sensitive exponential actor-critic (rsEAC), an off-policy model-free approach that incorporates novel procedures to avoid the explicit representation of exponential value functions and their gradients, and optimizes its policy w.r.t the entropic risk measure. We show that rsEAC produces more numerically stable updates compared to existing approaches and reliably learns risk-sensitive policies in challenging risky variants of continuous tasks in MuJoCo.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u654f\u611f\u578b\u6307\u6570Actor-Critic\uff08rsEAC\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u4f18\u5316\u71b5\u98ce\u9669\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u548c\u6570\u503c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728MuJoCo\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u53d8\u4f53\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u98ce\u9669\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u654f\u611f\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u548c\u6570\u503c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u8fde\u7eed\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u98ce\u9669\u654f\u611f\u578b\u6307\u6570Actor-Critic\uff08rsEAC\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u907f\u514d\u663e\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\u6307\u6570\u578b\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u53ca\u5176\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f18\u5316\u71b5\u98ce\u9669\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002", "result": "rsEAC\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6570\u503c\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5728MuJoCo\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u53d8\u4f53\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u98ce\u9669\u654f\u611f\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u71b5\u98ce\u9669\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0b\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b8c\u5907\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7rsEAC\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u590d\u6742\u8fde\u7eed\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u654f\u611f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3002"}}

In real-world applications, these models require periodic updates to adapt to new interactions and evolving user preferences. While incremental learning methods facilitate these updates, they face significant challenges. Replay-based approaches incur high memory and computational costs, and regularization-based methods often struggle to discard outdated or conflicting knowledge. To overcome these challenges, we propose SA-CAISR, a Stage-Adaptive and Conflict-Aware Incremental Sequential Recommendation framework. As a buffer-free framework, SA-CAISR operates using only the old model and new data, directly addressing the high costs of replay-based techniques. SA-CAISR introduces a novel Fisher-weighted knowledge-screening mechanism that dynamically identifies outdated knowledge by estimating parameter-level conflicts between the old model and new data, allowing our approach to selectively remove obsolete knowledge while preserving compatible historical patterns. This dynamic balance between stability and adaptability allows our method to achieve a new state-of-the-art performance in incremental SR. Specifically, SA-CAISR improves Recall@20 by 2.0%, MRR@20 by 1.2%, and NDCG@20 by 1.4% on average across datasets, while reducing memory usage by 97.5% and training time by 46.9% compared to the best baselines.

Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms unimodal baselines in naturalness, emotional clarity, and modal coherence, advancing socially expressive humanoid robotics for diverse real-world environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SeM\u00b2\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u8bed\u4e49-\u5e8f\u5217\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u97f3\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u4e91\u7aef\u4e0e\u8fb9\u7f18\u7aef\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u6027\u4e0e\u60c5\u611f\u8868\u8fbe\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4eff\u4eba\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bed\u97f3\u3001\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u548c\u624b\u52bf\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u4e14\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u9700\u8981\u65e0\u9700\u6301\u7eed\u4e91\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u7aef\u4fa7\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684SeM\u00b2\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u54cd\u5e94\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u8bed\u4e49-\u5e8f\u5217\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\uff08SSAM\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u7248\u672cSeM\u00b2\u2091\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u6027\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u8fb9\u7f18\u7248\u672c\u4fdd\u630195%\u76f8\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "SeM\u00b2\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u5177\u5907\u793e\u4f1a\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4eff\u4eba\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u5316\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

We propose a framework that decomposes complex simplifications into manageable steps through dynamic path planning, semantic-aware exemplar selection, and chain-of-thought generation with conversation history for coherent reasoning. Evaluation on five languages across two benchmarks shows our approach improves simplification effectiveness while reducing computational steps by 22-42%. Human evaluation confirms the fundamental trade-off between simplification effectiveness and meaning preservation.

This research presents Neural Sentinel, a novel unified approach that leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) to perform license plate recognition, state classification, and vehicle attribute extraction through a single forward pass. Our primary contribution lies in demonstrating that a fine-tuned PaliGemma 3B model, adapted via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), can simultaneously answer multiple visual questions about vehicle images, achieving 92.3% plate recognition accuracy, which is a 14.1% improvement over EasyOCR and 9.9% improvement over PaddleOCR baselines. We introduce a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) continual learning framework that incorporates user corrections while preventing catastrophic forgetting through experience replay, maintaining a 70:30 ratio of original training data to correction samples. The system achieves a mean inference latency of 152ms with an Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of 0.048, indicating well calibrated confidence estimates. Additionally, the VLM first architecture enables zero-shot generalization to auxiliary tasks including vehicle color detection (89%), seatbelt detection (82%), and occupancy counting (78%) without task specific training. Through extensive experimentation on real world toll plaza imagery, we demonstrate that unified vision language approaches represent a paradigm shift in ALPR systems, offering superior accuracy, reduced architectural complexity, and emergent multi-task capabilities that traditional pipeline approaches cannot achieve.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faNeural Sentinel\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u7684\u7edf\u4e00ALPR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u5b8c\u6210\u8f66\u724c\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u5dde\u5c5e\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0e\u8f66\u8f86\u5c5e\u6027\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfALPR\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u5b58\u5728\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u3001\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u590d\u6742\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u7b80\u6d01\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8ePaliGemma 3B\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528LoRA\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165Human-in-the-Loop\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u7ed3\u5408\u7ecf\u9a8c\u56de\u653e\u9632\u6b62\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff09\uff1b\u5229\u7528VLM\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u80fd\u529b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u8f66\u724c\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe92.3%\uff0c\u8f83EasyOCR\u548cPaddleOCR\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u534714.1%\u548c9.9%\uff1b\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf152ms\uff0cECE\u4e3a0.048\uff1b\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5b8c\u6210\u8f66\u8f86\u989c\u8272\uff0889%\uff09\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u5e26\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0882%\uff09\u3001\u8f7d\u5ba2\u8ba1\u6570\uff0878%\uff09\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7edf\u4e00VLM\u67b6\u6784\u4ee3\u8868ALPR\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u66f4\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u66f4\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0e\u65b0\u5174\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

But how robust are these reasoning traces to disruptions that occur within them? To address this question, we introduce a controlled evaluation framework that perturbs a model's own CoT at fixed timesteps. We design seven interventions (benign, neutral, and adversarial) and apply them to multiple open-weight RLLMs across Math, Science, and Logic tasks. Our results show that RLLMs are generally robust, reliably recovering from diverse perturbations, with robustness improving with model size and degrading when interventions occur early. However, robustness is not style-invariant: paraphrasing suppresses doubt-like expressions and reduces performance, while other interventions trigger doubt and support recovery. Recovery also carries a cost: neutral and adversarial noise can inflate CoT length by more than 200%, whereas paraphrasing shortens traces but harms accuracy. These findings provide new evidence on how RLLMs maintain reasoning integrity, identify doubt as a central recovery mechanism, and highlight trade-offs between robustness and efficiency that future training methods should address.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u6270\u52a8\u63a8\u7406\u578b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08RLLMs\uff09\u81ea\u8eab\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08CoT\uff09\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eRLLMs\u603b\u4f53\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u53ef\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u4f46\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u53d7\u5e72\u9884\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u65f6\u673a\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u2018\u6000\u7591\u2019\u662f\u5173\u952e\u6062\u590d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u63a8\u7406\u578b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08RLLMs\uff09\u751f\u6210\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08CoT\uff09\u5728\u906d\u9047\u5185\u90e8\u5e72\u6270\u65f6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u5176\u80fd\u5426\u7ef4\u6301\u5e76\u6062\u590d\u6b63\u786e\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u63a7\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728RLLMs\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u7684CoT\u4e2d\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u65bd\u52a0\u4e03\u7c7b\u5e72\u9884\uff08\u826f\u6027\u3001\u4e2d\u6027\u3001\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0e\u903b\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90RLLMs\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "RLLMs\u603b\u4f53\u5177\u5907\u8f83\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u968f\u6a21\u578b\u589e\u5927\u800c\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u5e72\u9884\u524a\u5f31\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u2018\u6000\u7591\u2019\u8868\u8fbe\u88ab\u89e6\u53d1\u65f6\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u4f46 paraphrasing \u4f1a\u6291\u5236\u6000\u7591\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u4e2d\u6027/\u5bf9\u6297\u566a\u58f0\u663e\u8457\u62c9\u957fCoT\uff08>200%\uff09\uff0c\u800cparaphrasing\u867d\u7f29\u77edCoT\u5374\u635f\u5bb3\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "RLLMs\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\u52a8\u6001\u6062\u590d\u673a\u5236\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u2018\u6000\u7591\u2019\uff09\uff0c\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5e76\u975e\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5728\u5e72\u9884\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u65f6\u673a\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u53ca\u8f93\u51fa\u98ce\u683c\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u542f\u793a\u3002"}}

A particularly elegant way of interpreting SCMs is do-Shapley, a game-theoretic method of quantifying the average effect of $d$ variables across exponentially many interventions. Like Shapley values, computing do-Shapley values generally requires evaluating exponentially many terms. The foundation of our work is a reformulation of do-Shapley values in terms of the irreducible sets of the underlying SCM. Leveraging this insight, we can exactly compute do-Shapley values in time linear in the number of irreducible sets $r$, which itself can range from $d$ to $2^d$ depending on the graph structure of the SCM. Since $r$ is unknown a priori, we complement the exact algorithm with an estimator that, like general Shapley value estimators, can be run with any query budget. As the query budget approaches $r$, our estimators can produce more accurate estimates than prior methods by several orders of magnitude, and, when the budget reaches $r$, return the Shapley values up to machine precision. Beyond computational speed, we also reduce the identification burden: we prove that non-parametric identifiability of do-Shapley values requires only the identification of interventional effects for the $d$ singleton coalitions, rather than all classes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\uff08SCM\uff09\u4e2d\u4e0d\u53ef\u7ea6\u96c6\u5408\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97do-Shapley\u503c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u8bc6\u522b\u6240\u9700\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "do-Shapley\u503c\u867d\u5177\u89e3\u91ca\u529b\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff08\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u4f20\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u5e72\u9884\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u66f4\u4f4e\u8bc6\u522b\u8d1f\u62c5\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06do-Shapley\u503c\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3aSCM\u4e2d\u4e0d\u53ef\u7ea6\u96c6\u5408\u7684\u51fd\u6570\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u53ef\u7ea6\u96c6\u6570\u91cfr\uff09\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u8c03\u67e5\u8be2\u9884\u7b97\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6e10\u8fdb\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7cbe\u786e\u7b97\u6cd5\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e3aO(r)\uff1b\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5728\u67e5\u8be2\u9884\u7b97\u8fber\u65f6\u53ef\u8fbe\u673a\u5668\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6570\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff1b\u8bc6\u522b\u4ec5\u9700d\u4e2a\u5355\u5143\u7d20\u5e72\u9884\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5168\u90e8\u5b50\u96c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86do-Shapley\u503c\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u653e\u5bbd\u4e86\u56e0\u679c\u8bc6\u522b\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8SCM\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Fine-tuning LLMs is parameter-inefficient, and prompt-based agentic reasoning is limited by context length and hallucination risk. Moreover, existing agentic recommendation systems predominantly leverages semantic knowledge while neglecting the collaborative filtering (CF) signals essential for implicit preference modeling. To address these limitations, we propose AMEM4Rec, an agentic LLM-based recommender that learns collaborative signals in an end-to-end manner through cross-user memory evolution. AMEM4Rec stores abstract user behavior patterns from user histories in a global memory pool. Within this pool, memories are linked to similar existing ones and iteratively evolved to reinforce shared cross-user patterns, enabling the system to become aware of CF signals without relying on a pre-trained CF model.

However, existing controllers are commonly driven either by predefined motion trajectories, which offer limited flexibility when user intent changes, or by continuous human teleoperation, which requires constant human involvement and limits autonomy. This work addresses the problem of how to drive a universal humanoid controller in a real-time and interactive manner. We present TextOp, a real-time text-driven humanoid motion generation and control framework that supports streaming language commands and on-the-fly instruction modification during execution. TextOp adopts a two-level architecture in which a high-level autoregressive motion diffusion model continuously generates short-horizon kinematic trajectories conditioned on the current text input, while a low-level motion tracking policy executes these trajectories on a physical humanoid robot. By bridging interactive motion generation with robust whole-body control, TextOp unlocks free-form intent expression and enables smooth transitions across multiple challenging behaviors such as dancing and jumping, within a single continuous motion execution. Extensive real-robot experiments and offline evaluations demonstrate instant responsiveness, smooth whole-body motion, and precise control.

When the length is unknown, as in realistic completion and infilling, naively comparing confidence across mask lengths becomes systematically biased, leading to under-generation or redundant continuations. In this paper, we show that this failure arises from an intrinsic lengthinduced bias in generation confidence estimates, leaving existing DLLMs without a robust way to determine generation length and making variablelength inference unreliable. To address this issue, we propose LR-DLLM, a length-regularized inference framework for DLLMs that treats generation length as an explicit variable and achieves reliable length determination at inference time. It decouples semantic compatibility from lengthinduced uncertainty through an explicit length regularization that corrects biased confidence estimates. Based on this, LR-DLLM enables dynamic expansion or contraction of the generation span without modifying the underlying DLLM or its training procedure. Experiments show that LRDLLM achieves 51.3% Pass@1 on HumanEvalInfilling under fully unknown lengths (+13.4% vs. DreamOn) and 51.5% average Pass@1 on four-language McEval (+14.3% vs. DreamOn).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLR-DLLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u957f\u5ea6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6821\u6b63\u6269\u6563\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08DLLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u53ef\u53d8\u957f\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08DLLMs\uff09\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u957f\u5ea6\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u8865\u5168\u4e0e\u586b\u5145\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u56e0\u56fa\u5b9a\u753b\u5e03\u5047\u8bbe\u548c\u957f\u5ea6\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u6b20\u751f\u6210\u6216\u5197\u4f59\u7eed\u5199\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLR-DLLM\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u79cd\u957f\u5ea6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684DLLM\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u957f\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u663e\u5f0f\u53d8\u91cf\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u957f\u5ea6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u89e3\u8026\u8bed\u4e49\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u4e0e\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u6821\u6b63\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u751f\u6210\u8de8\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728HumanEvalInfilling\uff08\u5b8c\u5168\u672a\u77e5\u957f\u5ea6\uff09\u4e0aPass@1\u8fbe51.3%\uff08+13.4% vs. DreamOn\uff09\uff1b\u5728\u56db\u8bed\u8a00McEval\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747Pass@1\u8fbe51.5%\uff08+14.3% vs. DreamOn\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "LR-DLLM\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86DLLMs\u5728\u53ef\u53d8\u957f\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u5224\u5b9a\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u6216\u8bad\u7ec3\u6539\u52a8\u3002"}}

We introduce and evaluate markerless approaches that replace expensive hardware and physical markers with low-cost visible and infrared light cameras incorporating stereo and depth sensing combined with algorithmic modeling of the facial geometry. Validation with $50$ human subjects yielded a median tracking discrepancy of only $2.32$ mm and $2.01\u00b0$ for the best markerless algorithms compared to a conventional marker-based system, which indicates sufficient accuracy for transcranial magnetic stimulation and a substantial improvement over prior markerless results. The results suggest that integration of the data from the various camera sensors can improve the overall accuracy further.

However, many verification and synthesis problems for POMDPs are undecidable or intractable. Most prominently, the seminal result of Madani et al. (2003) states that there is no algorithm that, given a POMDP and a set of target states, can compute the maximal probability of reaching the target states, or even approximate it up to a non-trivial constant. This is in stark contrast to fully observable Markov decision processes (MDPs), where the reachability value can be computed in polynomial time.\n  In this work, we introduce posterior-deterministic POMDPs, a novel class of POMDPs. Our main technical contribution is to show that for posterior-deterministic POMDPs, the maximal probability of reaching a given set of states can be approximated up to arbitrary precision.\n  A POMDP is posterior-deterministic if the next state can be uniquely determined by the current state, the action taken, and the observation received. While the actual state is generally uncertain in POMDPs, the posterior-deterministic property tells us that once the true state is known it remains known forever. This simple and natural definition includes all MDPs and captures classical non-trivial examples such as the Tiger POMDP (Kaelbling et al. 1998), making it one of the largest known classes of POMDPs for which the reachability value can be approximated.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684POMDP\u5b50\u7c7b\u2014\u2014\u540e\u9a8c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027POMDP\uff08posterior-deterministic POMDPs\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u53ef\u8fbe\u6982\u7387\u53ef\u88ab\u4efb\u610f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u903c\u8fd1\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178POMDP\u4e2d\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "POMDP\u4e2d\u8bb8\u591a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0e\u7efc\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5982\u76ee\u6807\u72b6\u6001\u53ef\u8fbe\u6982\u7387\u8ba1\u7b97\uff09\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u5224\u5b9a\u6216\u96be\u89e3\u7684\uff0c\u800cMDP\u4e2d\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u53ef\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u6c42\u89e3\uff1b\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u5bfb\u627e\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u7684\u6709\u610f\u4e49POMDP\u5b50\u7c7b\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u540e\u9a8c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027POMDP\uff1a\u4e0b\u4e00\u72b6\u6001\u7531\u5f53\u524d\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u548c\u89c2\u6d4b\u552f\u4e00\u786e\u5b9a\uff1b\u5728\u6b64\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u540e\u9a8c\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6f14\u5316\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u903c\u8fd1\u53ef\u8fbe\u6982\u7387\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u540e\u9a8c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027POMDP\u4e2d\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u6700\u5927\u53ef\u8fbe\u6982\u7387\u53ef\u88ab\u4efb\u610f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u903c\u8fd1\uff1b\u8be5\u7c7b\u5305\u542b\u6240\u6709MDP\u53ca\u7ecf\u5178Tiger POMDP\u7b49\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u5b9e\u4f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u540e\u9a8c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027POMDP\u662f\u76ee\u524d\u5df2\u77e5\u6700\u5927\u7684\u4e00\u7c7b\u53ef\u903c\u8fd1\u53ef\u8fbe\u6982\u7387\u7684POMDP\uff0c\u4e3a\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u5408\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Ratliff"], "title": "Online Learning for Uninformed Markov Games: Empirical Nash-Value Regret and Non-Stationarity Adaptation", "comment": "36 pages", "summary": "We study online learning in two-player uninformed Markov games, where the opponent's actions and policies are unobserved. In this setting, Tian et al. (2021) show that achieving no-external-regret is impossible without incurring an exponential dependence on the episode length $H$. They then turn to the weaker notion of Nash-value regret and propose a V-learning algorithm with regret $O(K^{2/3})$ after $K$ episodes. However, their algorithm and guarantee do not adapt to the difficulty of the problem: even in the case where the opponent follows a fixed policy and thus $O(\\sqrt{K})$ external regret is well-known to be achievable, their result is still the worse rate $O(K^{2/3})$ on a weaker metric.\n  In this work, we fully address both limitations. First, we introduce empirical Nash-value regret, a new regret notion that is strictly stronger than Nash-value regret and naturally reduces to external regret when the opponent follows a fixed policy. Moreover, under this new metric, we propose a parameter-free algorithm that achieves an $O(\\min \\{\\sqrt{K} + (CK)^{1/3},\\sqrt{LK}\\})$ regret bound, where $C$ quantifies the variance of the opponent's policies and $L$ denotes the number of policy switches (both at most $O(K)$). Therefore, our results not only recover the two extremes -- $O(\\sqrt{K})$ external regret when the opponent is fixed and $O(K^{2/3})$ Nash-value regret in the worst case -- but also smoothly interpolate between these extremes by automatically adapting to the opponent's non-stationarity. We achieve so by first providing a new analysis of the epoch-based V-learning algorithm by Mao et al. (2022), establishing an $O(\u03b7C + \\sqrt{K/\u03b7})$ regret bound, where $\u03b7$ is the epoch incremental factor. Next, we show how to adaptively restart this algorithm with an appropriate $\u03b7$ in response to the potential non-stationarity of the opponent, eventually achieving our final results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60 regret \u5ea6\u91cf\u2014\u2014empirical Nash-value regret\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u8c03\u53c2\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5bf9\u624b\u7b56\u7565\u53d8\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff08\u7531\u65b9\u5dee C \u548c\u5207\u6362\u6b21\u6570 L \u523b\u753b\uff09\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u9002\u5e94\u5bf9\u624b\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece O(\u221aK) \u5230 O(K^{2/3}) \u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u63d2\u503c\u5f0f\u9057\u61be\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5bf9\u624b\u7b56\u7565\u672a\u77e5\u65f6\u65e0\u6cd5\u517c\u987e\u5f3a regret \u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982 external regret\uff09\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff1aTian et al.

We introduce LLMScholarBench, a benchmark for auditing LLM-based scholar recommendation that jointly evaluates model infrastructure and end-user interventions across multiple tasks. LLMScholarBench measures both technical quality and social representation using nine metrics. We instantiate the benchmark in physics expert recommendation and audit 22 LLMs under temperature variation, representation-constrained prompting, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) via web search. Our results show that end-user interventions do not yield uniform improvements but instead redistribute error across dimensions. Higher temperature degrades validity, consistency, and factuality. Representation-constrained prompting improves diversity at the expense of factuality, while RAG primarily improves technical quality while reducing diversity and parity. Overall, end-user interventions reshape trade-offs rather than providing a general fix.

Existing progress in humanoid facial expression imitation remains limited, often failing to achieve either real-time performance or realistic expressiveness due to offline video-based inference designs and insufficient ability to capture and transfer subtle expression details. To address these limitations, we present VividFace, a real-time and realistic facial expression shadowing system for humanoid robots. An optimized imitation framework X2CNet++ enhances expressiveness by fine-tuning the human-to-humanoid facial motion transfer module and introducing a feature-adaptation training strategy for better alignment across different image sources. Real-time shadowing is further enabled by a video-stream-compatible inference pipeline and a streamlined workflow based on asynchronous I/O for efficient communication across devices.

However, despite powerful generation ability, LLMs remain weak at verifying their own answers, revealing a persistent capability asymmetry between generation and self-verification. In this work, we conduct an in-depth investigation of this asymmetry throughout training evolution and show that, even on the same task, improving generation does not lead to corresponding improvements in self-verification. Interestingly, we find that the reverse direction of this asymmetry behaves differently: learning to self-verify can effectively improve generation performance, achieving accuracy comparable to standard generation training while yielding more efficient and effective reasoning traces. Building on this observation, we further explore integrating self-verification into generation training by formulating a multi-task reinforcement learning framework, where generation and self-verification are optimized as two independent but complementary objectives. Extensive experiments across benchmarks and models demonstrate performance gains over generation-only training in both generation and verification capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u4e0d\u80fd\u540c\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u53cd\u8fc7\u6765\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\u5374\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e24\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u5177\u5907\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b54\u6848\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u8584\u5f31\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u63a2\u7a76\u4e0e\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u6f14\u5316\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee5\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9a71\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u601d\u8def\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8bbe\u4e3a\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u5355\u72ec\u8bad\u7ec3\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u4ea7\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u591a\u4efb\u52a1RL\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u751f\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u6548\u679c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\u5b58\u5728\u672c\u8d28\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u5c06\u4e8c\u8005\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\uff09\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u6574\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Stewart", "Tarjei Paule Hage", "Yu-Chuan Hsu", "Markus J. Buehler"], "title": "GraphAgents: Knowledge Graph-Guided Agentic AI for Cross-Domain Materials Design", "comment": null, "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to accelerate discovery by reasoning across the expanding scientific landscape. Yet, the challenge is no longer access to information but connecting it in meaningful, domain-spanning ways. In materials science, where innovation demands integrating concepts from molecular chemistry to mechanical performance, this is especially acute. Neither humans nor single-agent LLMs can fully contend with this torrent of information, with the latter often prone to hallucinations. To address this bottleneck, we introduce a multi-agent framework guided by large-scale knowledge graphs to find sustainable substitutes for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)-chemicals currently under intense regulatory scrutiny. Agents in the framework specialize in problem decomposition, evidence retrieval, design parameter extraction, and graph traversal, uncovering latent connections across distinct knowledge pockets to support hypothesis generation. Ablation studies show that the full multi-agent pipeline outperforms single-shot prompting, underscoring the value of distributed specialization and relational reasoning. We demonstrate that by tailoring graph traversal strategies, the system alternates between exploitative searches focusing on domain-critical outcomes and exploratory searches surfacing emergent cross-connections. Illustrated through the exemplar of biomedical tubing, the framework generates sustainable PFAS-free alternatives that balance tribological performance, thermal stability, chemical resistance, and biocompatibility.

Yet in implicit-feedback, a single global temperature and equal treatment of uniformly sampled negatives can lead to brittle training, because sampled sets may contain varying degrees of relevant or informative competitors. The optimal loss sharpness for a user-item pair with a particular set of negatives, can be suboptimal or destabilising for another with different negatives. We introduce Dual-scale Softmax Loss (DSL), which infers effective sharpness from the sampled competition itself. DSL adds two complementary branches to the log-sum-exp backbone. Firstly it reweights negatives within each training instance using hardness and item--item similarity, secondly it adapts a per-example temperature from the competition intensity over a constructed competitor slate. Together, these components preserve the geometry of SL while reshaping the competition distribution across negatives and across examples.\n  Over several representative benchmarks and backbones, DSL yields substantial gains over strong baselines, with improvements over SL exceeding $10%$ in several settings and averaging $6.22%$ across datasets, metrics, and backbones. Under out-of-distribution (OOD) popularity shift, the gains are larger, with an average of $9.31%$ improvement over SL. We further provide a theoretical, distributionally robust optimisation (DRO) analysis, which demonstrates how DSL reshapes the robust payoff and the KL deviation for ambiguous instances. This helps explain the empirically observed improvements in accuracy and robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u5c3a\u5ea6Softmax\u635f\u5931\uff08DSL\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u7684\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u6e29\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9690\u5f0f\u53cd\u9988\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfSoftmax Loss\u5728\u9690\u5f0f\u53cd\u9988\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u5168\u5c40\u6e29\u5ea6\u548c\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u56e0\u4e0d\u540c\u6837\u672c\u7684\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u96c6\u5408\u7ade\u4e89\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff0c\u5355\u4e00\u6e29\u5ea6\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u914d\u6240\u6709\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "DSL\u5728log-sum-exp\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u4e2a\u5206\u652f\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u96be\u5ea6\u548c\u7269\u54c1\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u5185\u7684\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\uff1b2\uff09\u6839\u636e\u6784\u9020\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u8005\u5217\u8868\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u5f3a\u5ea6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u7684\u6e29\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u5e72\u4e0a\uff0cDSL\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53476.22%\uff1b\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe9.31%\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5177\u6709\u5206\u5e03\u9c81\u68d2\u4f18\u5316\uff08DRO\uff09\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u6a21\u7cca\u6837\u672c\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6536\u76ca\u4e0eKL\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "DSL\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u91c7\u6837\u7ade\u4e89\u672c\u8eab\u63a8\u65ad\u6709\u6548\u635f\u5931\u9510\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301Softmax\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u91cd\u5851\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u548c\u6837\u672c\u95f4\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u517c\u987e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u662f\u9690\u5f0f\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

Existing vision-language-action (VLA) models struggle with this form of task-level reasoning. They either depend on prompt-based in-context decomposition, which is unstable and sensitive to linguistic variations, or end-to-end long-horizon training, which requires large-scale demonstrations and entangles task-level reasoning with low-level control. We present in-parameter structured task reasoning (iSTAR), a framework for enhancing VLA models via functional differentiation induced by in-parameter structural reasoning. Instead of treating VLAs as monolithic policies, iSTAR embeds task-level semantic structure directly into model parameters, enabling differentiated task-level inference without external planners or handcrafted prompt inputs. This injected structure takes the form of implicit dynamic scene-graph knowledge that captures object relations, subtask semantics, and task-level dependencies in parameter space. Across diverse manipulation benchmarks, iSTAR achieves more reliable task decompositions and higher success rates than both in-context and end-to-end VLA baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of parameter-space structural reasoning for functional differentiation and improved generalization across task variations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faiSTAR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5982\u9690\u5f0f\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u56fe\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08VLA\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u5206\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u6216\u624b\u5de5\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5206\u89e3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u654f\u611f\uff1b\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u6f14\u793a\u4e14\u6df7\u6dc6\u9ad8\u5c42\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u5e95\u5c42\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fain-parameter structured task reasoning\uff08iSTAR\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5bf9\u8c61\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u8bed\u4e49\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u4f9d\u8d56\uff09\u4ee5\u9690\u5f0f\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u5f62\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u529f\u80fd\u5206\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u64cd\u4f5c\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0ciSTAR\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u7aef\u5230\u7aefVLA\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684 task decomposition \u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u5347VLA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u5206\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Despite recent progress, unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models remains challenging due to high computational costs and the difficulty of balancing effective forgetting with retention of unrelated concepts. We introduce FADE (Fast Adapter for Data Erasure), a two-stage unlearning method for image generation that combines parameter localization with self-distillation. FADE first identifies parameters most responsible for the forget set using gradient-based saliency and constrains updates through sparse LoRA adapters, ensuring lightweight, localized modifications. In a second stage, FADE applies a self-distillation objective that overwrites the forgotten concept with a user-defined surrogate while preserving behavior on retained data. The resulting adapters are memory-efficient, reversible, and can be merged or removed at runtime, enabling flexible deployment in production systems. We evaluated FADE on the UnlearnCanvas benchmark and conducted ablation studies on Imagenette, Labeled Faces in the Wild, AtharvaTaras Dog Breeds Dataset, and SUN Attributes datasets, demonstrating State-of-the-Art unlearning performance with fine-grained control over the forgetting-retention trade-off.

For complex tasks such as image editing, reward models are required to capture global semantic consistency and implicit logical constraints beyond local similarity. Existing reward modeling approaches have clear limitations. Discriminative reward models align well with human preferences but struggle with complex semantics due to limited reasoning supervision. Generative reward models offer stronger semantic understanding and reasoning, but they are costly at inference time and difficult to align directly with human preferences. To this end, we propose Joint Reward Modeling (JRM), which jointly optimizes preference learning and language modeling on a shared vision-language backbone. This approach internalizes the semantic and reasoning capabilities of generative models into efficient discriminative representations, enabling fast and accurate evaluation. JRM achieves state-of-the-art results on MMRB2 and EditReward-Bench, and significantly improves stability and performance in downstream online reinforcement learning.

This work explores a fundamental principle for enhancing generative models: treating retrieval as a form of dynamic in-context learning. We test an adaptive retrieval-augmented architecture where an LLM agent actively decides when to query an external knowledge base during its reasoning process. We compare this adaptive strategy against a standard Chain-of-Thought (CoT) baseline and a static retrieval approach on the GSM8K and MATH-500 benchmarks. Although our experiments show that static retrieval is inferior to CoT, the adaptive retrieval shows interesting behavior: While traces including retrieved results show slightly worse performance compared to CoT, traces that do not include retrieval actually perform better compared to CoT. This suggests that: (a) retrieval only rarely helps reasoning (we show a few counterexamples, e.g. using useful theorems) and (b) actively not using retrieval is indicative of good model performance. Furthermore, we find that the model scales its retrieval frequency with the difficulty of the problem, reinforcing that the decision to retrieve is a crucial metacognitive signal. The agent's ability to self-assess its knowledge and selectively engage with external information represents a key principle for building more robust and reliable generative models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u8ba9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4e3b\u52a8\u51b3\u5b9a\u662f\u5426\u67e5\u8be2\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u68c0\u7d22\u51b3\u7b56\u672c\u8eab\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u9759\u6001\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u7b49\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4f7fLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u51b3\u5b9a\u662f\u5426\u68c0\u7d22\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728GSM8K\u548cMATH-500\u4e0a\u4e0eCoT\u53ca\u9759\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u9759\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u5982CoT\uff1b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\uff0c\u672a\u89e6\u53d1\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u53cd\u800c\u4f18\u4e8eCoT\uff1b\u68c0\u7d22\u9891\u7387\u968f\u9898\u76ee\u96be\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u68c0\u7d22\u51b3\u7b56\u5177\u6709\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u4e0d\u68c0\u7d22\u662f\u5176\u81ea\u4fe1\u4e0e\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4f53\u73b0\uff0c\u68c0\u7d22\u51b3\u7b56\u672c\u8eab\u662f\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u539f\u5219\u3002"}}

Based on this data, we introduce a three-tier hierarchical evaluaion framework to assess recommendations from recall to precise expert identification.

To resolve these method limitations, we propose Profiling Scholars with Multi-gate Mixture-of-Experts (Pro-MMoE), a novel framework that synergizes Large Language Models (LLMs) with Multi-task Learning. Specifically, it utilizes LLM-generated semantic profiles to preserve fine-grained expertise nuances and interpretability, while employing a Task-Adaptive MMoE architecture to dynamically balance conflicting evaluation goals.

Unlike humans, a physical robot can simultaneously present different identities and have them reside and control different parts of the robot. This paper presents a novel study that investigates how users perceive a robot where different robot control domains (head and gripper) are presented as independent robots. We conducted a mixed design study where participants experienced one of three presentations: a single robot, two agents with shared full control (co-embodiment), or two agents with split control across robot control domains (split-embodiment). Participants underwent three distinct tasks -- a mundane data entry task where the robot provides motivational support, an individual sorting task with isolated robot failures, and a collaborative arrangement task where the robot causes a failure that directly affects the human participant.

Prior works on LLM-based tutoring typically learn a single tutor policy and do not capture the diversity of tutoring styles. In real-world tutor-student interactions, pedagogical intent is realized through adaptive instructional strategies, with tutors varying the level of scaffolding, instructional directiveness, feedback, and affective support in response to learners' needs. These differences can all impact dialogue dynamics and student engagement. In this paper, we explore how tutor personas embedded in human tutor-student dialogues can be used to guide LLM behavior without relying on explicitly prompted instructions. We modify Bidirectional Preference Optimization (BiPO) to learn a steering vector, an activation-space direction that steers model responses towards certain tutor personas. We find that this steering vector captures tutor-specific variation across dialogue contexts, improving semantic alignment with ground-truth tutor utterances and increasing preference-based evaluations, while largely preserving lexical similarity. Analysis of the learned directional coefficients further reveals interpretable structure across tutors, corresponding to consistent differences in tutoring behavior. These results demonstrate that activation steering offers an effective and interpretable way for controlling tutor-specific variation in LLMs using signals derived directly from human dialogue data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f15\u5bfc\uff08activation steering\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4eba\u7c7b\u5e08\u751f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u5bfc\u5e08\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a\u5373\u53ef\u5f15\u5bfc\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u7279\u5b9a\u6559\u5b66\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u56de\u5e94\uff1b\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u53cc\u5411\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff08BiPO\uff09\u5b66\u4e60\u51fa\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u2018\u5f15\u5bfc\u5411\u91cf\u2019\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u504f\u597d\u8bc4\u4f30\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8bcd\u6c47\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u8f85\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u5b66\u4e60\u5355\u4e00\u6559\u5b66\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u6559\u5b66\u4e2d\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8f85\u5bfc\u98ce\u683c\uff08\u5982\u811a\u624b\u67b6\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3001\u6307\u5bfc\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3001\u53cd\u9988\u65b9\u5f0f\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u652f\u6301\uff09\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u98ce\u683c\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u5bf9\u8bdd\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u5b66\u751f\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u6539\u8fdbBidirectional Preference Optimization\uff08BiPO\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u4e00\u4e2a\u2018\u5f15\u5bfc\u5411\u91cf\u2019\uff08steering vector\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9690\u5f0f\u5f15\u5bfcLLM\u54cd\u5e94\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u7279\u5b9a\u5bfc\u5e08\u4eba\u683c\uff1b\u8be5\u5411\u91cf\u4ece\u4eba\u7c7b\u5e08\u751f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u663e\u5f0f\u6307\u4ee4\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u5b66\u5f15\u5bfc\u5411\u91cf\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u4e0d\u540c\u5bfc\u5e08\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u5bfc\u5e08\u8bdd\u8bed\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u53ca\u504f\u597d\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f97\u5206\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u57fa\u672c\u7ef4\u6301\u8bcd\u6c47\u5c42\u9762\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff1b\u65b9\u5411\u7cfb\u6570\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8de8\u5bfc\u5e08\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f15\u5bfc\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ec5\u51ed\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u8c03\u63a7LLM\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u98ce\u683c\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u3001\u4eba\u683c\u5316AI\u5bfc\u5e08\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Although several AI-based approaches have been proposed to address isolated subtasks of MSP, a unified methodology for solving the entire MSP task has yet to be established. We propose MSP-LLM, a unified LLM-based framework that formulates MSP as a structured process composed of two constituent subproblems: precursor prediction (PP) and synthesis operation prediction (SOP). Our approach introduces a discrete material class as an intermediate decision variable that organizes both tasks into a chemically consistent decision chain. For OP, we further incorporate hierarchical precursor types as synthesis-relevant inductive biases and employ an explicit conditioning strategy that preserves precursor-related information in the autoregressive decoding state. Extensive experiments show that MSP-LLM consistently outperforms existing methods on both PP and SOP, as well as on the complete MSP task, demonstrating an effective and scalable framework for MSP that can accelerate real-world materials discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MSP-LLM\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6750\u6599\u5408\u6210\u89c4\u5212\uff08MSP\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u524d\u9a71\u4f53\u9884\u6d4b\uff08PP\uff09\u548c\u5408\u6210\u64cd\u4f5c\u9884\u6d4b\uff08SOP\uff09\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u79bb\u6563\u6750\u6599\u7c7b\u522b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u95f4\u53d8\u91cf\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5316\u5b66\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u5404\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u53ca\u6574\u4f53MSP\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u6750\u6599\u5408\u6210\u89c4\u5212\uff08MSP\uff09\u662fAI\u9a71\u52a8\u6750\u6599\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6027\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u89e3\u51b3\u5b64\u7acb\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMSP-LLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06MSP\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u524d\u9a71\u4f53\u9884\u6d4b\uff08PP\uff09\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u64cd\u4f5c\u9884\u6d4b\uff08SOP\uff09\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u79bb\u6563\u6750\u6599\u7c7b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u95f4\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5316\u5b66\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u94fe\uff1b\u5728SOP\u4e2d\u878d\u5165\u5206\u5c42\u524d\u9a71\u4f53\u7c7b\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u663e\u5f0f\u6761\u4ef6\u7b56\u7565\u4fdd\u6301\u524d\u9a71\u4f53\u4fe1\u606f\u4e8e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89e3\u7801\u72b6\u6001\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "MSP-LLM\u5728PP\u3001SOP\u53ca\u5b8c\u6574MSP\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u6301\u7eed\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MSP-LLM\u4e3a\u6750\u6599\u5408\u6210\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u5316\u5b66\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684LLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u52a0\u901f\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u6750\u6599\u53d1\u73b0\u8fdb\u7a0b\u3002"}}

We ask whether, beyond producing good tours, a trained TSP solver learns internal representations that transfer to other optimization-relevant objectives, in the spirit of transfer learning from other domains. We train several attention-based TSP policies, collect their internal activations, and train probes on node/edge embeddings for two NP-hard prescriptive downstream tasks inspired by real-world logistics scenarios: node-removal sensitivity (identifying the most impactful node to remove) and edge-forbid sensitivity (identifying the most critical edge to retain). On a Euclidean TSP100-trained model, probes for both tasks are competitive with existing baselines. Ensembling probe signals with geometric features outperforms the strongest baselines: 65\\% top-1 accuracy (vs. 58\\% baseline) for the best-node-removal task, and 73\\% top-1 accuracy (vs. 67\\% baseline) for the worst-edge identification task. To our knowledge, we are the first to study neural TSP solvers as transferable encoders for prescriptive what-if decision-support objectives beyond tour construction. Finally, we show that transfer accuracy increases with solver quality across training and model scale, suggesting that training stronger NCO solvers also yields more useful encoders for downstream objectives.

The expert is first trained with privileged state information, inducing a latent space sufficient for control, after which its latent interface and action head are frozen. A lightweight adapter is then trained to map raw visual-language observations, via a frozen vision-language model, into the expert's latent space, reducing the problem of visuomotor learning to supervised latent alignment rather than end-to-end policy optimization. This decoupling enforces a stable contract between perception and control, enabling expert behavior to be reused across sensing modalities and environmental variations. We instantiate LCLA and evaluate it on a vision-language indoor navigation task, where aligned latent spaces yield strong in-distribution performance and robust zero-shot generalization to unseen environments, lighting conditions, and viewpoints while remaining lightweight at inference time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLCLA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u611f\u5b98\u89c2\u6d4b\u5bf9\u9f50\u5230\u4e13\u5bb6\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u5bfc\u822a\uff1b\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u8026\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLCLA\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5148\u7528\u7279\u6743\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e13\u5bb6\u7b56\u7565\u5e76\u51bb\u7ed3\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u63a5\u53e3\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u5934\uff1b\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f7b\u91cf\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u539f\u59cb\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u89c2\u6d4b\uff08\u7ecf\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\uff09\u5bf9\u9f50\u81f3\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5c06\u5177\u8eab\u5b66\u4e60\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u76d1\u7763\u5f0f\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5ba4\u5185\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86LCLA\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff1a\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u73af\u5883\u3001\u5149\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u8f7b\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "LCLA\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u590d\u7528\u4e13\u5bb6\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u5bfc\u822a\u3002"}}

However, LLM judges show biases for length and order among others, and are vulnerable to various adversarial input prompts. While recent studies have looked into these biases, few have analyzed them at a more granular level in relation to a well-defined overlap metric. In this work we provide an LLM judge bias analysis as a function of overlap with human-written responses in the domain of summarization. We test 9 recent LLMs with parameter counts ranging from 1 billion to 12 billion, including variants of Gemma 3 and LLaMA 3. We find that LLM judges increasingly prefer summaries generated by other LLMs over those written by humans as the similarities (as measured by ROUGE and BLEU) between the judged summaries decrease, and this pattern extends to all but one model tested, and exists regardless of the models' own position biases. Additionally, we find that models struggle to judge even summaries with limited overlaps, suggesting that LLM-as-a-judge in the summary domain should rely on techniques beyond a simple comparison.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\u5728\u6458\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u504f\u597d\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6LLM\u751f\u6210\u6458\u8981\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4eba\u5de5\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u4e14\u8be5\u504f\u5dee\u4e0eROUGE/BLEU\u91cd\u53e0\u5ea6\u5448\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u9700\u8d85\u8d8a\u7b80\u5355\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\u867d\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u957f\u5ea6\u3001\u987a\u5e8f\u7b49\u504f\u5dee\u53ca\u5bf9\u6297\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u57fa\u4e8e\u660e\u786e\u5b9a\u4e49\u91cd\u53e0\u5ea6\uff08\u5982ROUGE/BLEU\uff09\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u6458\u8981\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4ee5ROUGE\u548cBLEU\u8861\u91cfLLM\u751f\u6210\u6458\u8981\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u6458\u8981\u7684\u91cd\u53e0\u5ea6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f309\u4e2a\u53c2\u6570\u91cf1B\u201312B\u7684\u4e3b\u6d41LLM\uff08\u542bGemma 3\u548cLLaMA 3\u53d8\u4f53\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\u7684\u504f\u597d\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u63a7\u5236\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u5dee\u53d8\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u7edd\u5927\u591a\u6570\u88ab\u6d4bLLM\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\u5728\u6458\u8981\u91cd\u53e0\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u65f6\uff0c\u53cd\u800c\u66f4\u504f\u597dLLM\u751f\u6210\u6458\u8981\u800c\u975e\u4eba\u5de5\u6458\u8981\uff1b\u4e14\u5373\u4f7f\u91cd\u53e0\u5ea6\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5176\u5224\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\u4ecd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5355\u7eaf\u4f9d\u8d56LLM-as-a-judge\u8fdb\u884c\u6458\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u9700\u5f15\u5165\u8d85\u8d8a\u76f4\u63a5\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982\u53c2\u8003\u589e\u5f3a\u3001\u6821\u51c6\u673a\u5236\u6216\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\uff09\u3002"}}

Illusory Completion in Search Agents", "comment": null, "summary": "Recent search agents leverage multi-turn reasoning and search tools to achieve strong performance on multi-hop and long-horizon benchmarks. Yet it remains unclear whether they reliably reason across all requirements by tracking, verifying, and maintaining multiple conditions in these questions. We study this capability under multi-constraint problems, where valid answers must satisfy several constraints simultaneously. We find that illusory completion frequently occurs, wherein agents believe tasks are complete despite unresolved or violated constraints, leading to underverified answers. To diagnose this behavior, we introduce the Epistemic Ledger, an evaluation framework that tracks evidential support and agents' beliefs for each constraint throughout multi-turn reasoning. Our analysis reveals four recurring failure patterns: bare assertions, overlooked refutations, stagnation, and premature exit. Motivated by these findings, we examine whether explicit constraint-state tracking during execution mitigates these failures via LiveLedger, an inference-time tracker. This simple intervention consistently improves performance, substantially reducing underverified answers (by up to 26.5%) and improving overall accuracy (by up to 11.6%) on multi-constraint problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u641c\u7d22\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u5904\u7406\u591a\u7ea6\u675f\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\u201c\u5e7b\u89c9\u5b8c\u6210\u201d\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Epistemic Ledger\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u548cLiveLedger\u5b9e\u65f6\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u7ea6\u675f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u641c\u7d22\u4ee3\u7406\u867d\u5728\u591a\u8df3\u548c\u957f\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u80fd\u5426\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u8ffd\u8e2a\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5e76\u7ef4\u6301\u591a\u4e2a\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u4ecd\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff1b\u4f5c\u8005\u5173\u6ce8\u591a\u7ea6\u675f\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u4ee3\u7406\u5bf9\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEpistemic Ledger\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u8bca\u65ad\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5bf9\u5404\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4e0e\u8bc1\u636e\u652f\u6301\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u56db\u7c7b\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u8fdb\u800c\u8bbe\u8ba1LiveLedger\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u72b6\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "LiveLedger\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u672a\u5145\u5206\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u7b54\u6848\uff08\u6700\u591a\u964d\u4f4e26.5%\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6574\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff08\u6700\u591a\u63d0\u9ad811.6%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u72b6\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u591a\u7ea6\u675f\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u5b8c\u6210\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u641c\u7d22\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as celebrated LoRA facilitate efficient adaptation of large foundation models using labeled, high-quality and generally scarce task data. To mitigate data scarcity in fine-tuning of foundation models, we propose to leverage task similarity across multiple downstream users. Intuitively, users with similar tasks must be able to assist each other in boosting the effective fine-tuning data size. We propose Collaborative Low-Rank Adaptation, or CoLoRA, which exploits task similarity to collaboratively and efficiently fine-tune personalized foundation models. The main idea in CoLoRA is to train one shared adapter capturing underlying task similarities across all tasks, and personalized adapters tailored to user-specific tasks. We theoretically study CoLoRA on heterogeneous linear regression and provide provable guarantees for ground truth recovery. We also conduct several natural language experiments with varying task similarity, which further demonstrate that when trained together with similar tasks, individual performances are significantly boosted.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCoLoRA\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u5f0f\u4f4e\u79e9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u591a\u7528\u6237\u95f4\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u5171\u4eab\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u9002\u914d\u5668\u5e76\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7528\u6237\u5b9a\u5236\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f13\u89e3\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u4e0b\u6e38\u7528\u6237\u95f4\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5b9e\u73b0\u534f\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCollaborative Low-Rank Adaptation\uff08CoLoRA\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u4e2a\u5171\u4eab\u9002\u914d\u5668\u5efa\u6a21\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u5171\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u591a\u4e2a\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u9002\u914d\u5668\u9002\u914d\u5404\u81ea\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u771f\u503c\u6062\u590d\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u771f\u503c\u6062\u590d\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff1bNLP\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u4f3c\u4efb\u52a1\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5404\u4efb\u52a1\u5355\u72ec\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "CoLoRA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u534f\u540c\u5fae\u8c03\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6316\u6398\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

The ATUGV is a multi-body system with mobile robots that can be used to power the ATUGV morphable motion, powered cells to enclose the mobile robots, unpowered cells to contain payloads, and a deformable structure to integrate cells through bars and joints. The objective is that all powered and unpowered cells motion can safely track a desired affine transformation, where an affine transformation can be decomposed into translation, rigid body rotation, and deformation. To this end, the paper first uses a deep neural network to structure cell interconnection in such a way that every cell can freely move over the deformation plane, and the entire structure can reconfigurably deform to track a desired affine transformation. Then, the mobile robots, contained by the powered cells and stepper motors, regulating the connections of the powered and unpowered cells, design the proper controls so that all cells safely track the desired affine transformation. The functionality of the proposed ATUGV is validated through hardware experimentation and simulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u4eff\u5c04\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u65e0\u4eba\u5730\u9762\u8f66\u8f86\uff08ATUGV\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u6fc0\u8fdb\u7684\u5f62\u53d8\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0e\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4eff\u5c04\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u643a\u5e26\u591a\u79cd\u8f7d\u8377\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u6fc0\u8fdb\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u5f62\u53d8\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u5730\u9762\u8f66\u8f86\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3001\u4f9b\u7535\u5355\u5143\u3001\u975e\u4f9b\u7535\u8f7d\u8377\u5355\u5143\u53ca\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4f18\u5316\u5355\u5143\u95f4\u8fde\u63a5\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f7f\u5404\u5355\u5143\u53ef\u5728\u5f62\u53d8\u5e73\u9762\u5185\u81ea\u7531\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e76\u6574\u4f53\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u5730\u8ddf\u8e2a\u76ee\u6807\u4eff\u5c04\u53d8\u6362\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b65\u8fdb\u7535\u673a\u4e0e\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u534f\u8c03\u6240\u6709\u5355\u5143\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86ATUGV\u5bf9\u5e73\u79fb\u3001\u521a\u4f53\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0e\u5f62\u53d8\u7b49\u4eff\u5c04\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u786c\u4ef6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0e\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u529f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ATUGV\u67b6\u6784\u53ca\u5176\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6267\u884c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, mainstream approaches often train this ability using only outcome-based supervision, neglecting the quality of intermediate thoughts and actions. We introduce SRR-Judge, a framework for reliable step-level assessment of reasoning and search actions. Integrated into a modified ReAct-style rate-and-refine workflow, SRR-Judge provides fine-grained guidance for search-integrated reasoning and enables efficient post-training annotation. Using SRR-annotated data, we apply an iterative rejection sampling fine-tuning procedure to enhance the deep search capability of the base agent. Empirically, SRR-Judge delivers more reliable step-level evaluations than much larger models such as DeepSeek-V3.1, with its ratings showing strong correlation with final answer correctness. Moreover, aligning the policy with SRR-Judge annotated trajectories leads to substantial performance gains, yielding over a 10 percent average absolute pass@1 improvement across challenging deep search benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSRR-Judge\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6df1\u5ea6\u641c\u7d22\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u641c\u7d22\u52a8\u4f5c\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6b65\u9aa4\u7ea7\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u7387-\u7cbe\u70bc\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e0e\u8fed\u4ee3\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u641c\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e3b\u6d41\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ed3\u679c\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\u641c\u7d22\u96c6\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e2d\u95f4\u601d\u7ef4\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSRR-Judge\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6b65\u9aa4\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u641c\u7d22\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u5c06\u5176\u5d4c\u5165\u6539\u8fdb\u7684ReAct\u5f0frate-and-refine\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6807\u6ce8\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8eSRR\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8fed\u4ee3\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "SRR-Judge\u5728\u6b65\u9aa4\u7ea7\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0a\u6bd4DeepSeek-V3.1\u7b49\u66f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u5176\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0e\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u9f50SRR\u6807\u6ce8\u8f68\u8ff9\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6df1\u5ea6\u641c\u7d22\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747pass@1\u63d0\u5347\u8d8510\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6b65\u9aa4\u7ea7\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u641c\u7d22\u96c6\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0cSRR-Judge\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u641c\u7d22\u4ee3\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Conventional approaches to the assessment of image displacement and non-contact material probing typically rely on time-consuming iterative algorithms for non-rigid image registration and constitutive modelling using discretization and iterative numerical solving techniques, such as Finite Element Method (FEM) and Finite Difference Method (FDM), which are not suitable for high-throughput data processing. Here, we present an efficient deep learning based end-to-end approach for the estimation of continuum displacement and material compressibility directly from the image series. Based on two deep neural networks for image registration and material compressibility estimation, this framework outperforms conventional approaches in terms of efficiency and accuracy. In particular, our experimental results show that the deep learning model trained on a set of reference data can accurately determine the material compressibility even in the presence of substantial local deviations of the mapping predicted by image registration from the reference displacement field. Our findings suggest that the remarkable accuracy of the deep learning end-to-end model originates from its ability to assess higher-order cognitive features, such as the vorticity of the vector field, rather than conventional local features of the image displacement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u4f30\u8ba1\u8fde\u7eed\u4ecb\u8d28\u4f4d\u79fb\u548c\u6750\u6599\u53ef\u538b\u7f29\u6027\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u8fed\u4ee3\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u5982FEM/FDM\uff09\u5728\u975e\u63a5\u89e6\u5f0f\u6750\u6599\u8868\u5f81\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u6162\u3001\u96be\u4e8e\u9ad8\u901a\u91cf\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u975e\u63a5\u89e6\u5f0f\u6750\u6599\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f9d\u8d56\u8017\u65f6\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u56fe\u50cf\u914d\u51c6\u4e0e\u6570\u503c\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982FEM\u3001FDM\uff09\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u9ad8\u901a\u91cf\u9700\u6c42\uff1b\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e24\u4e2a\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u975e\u521a\u6027\u56fe\u50cf\u914d\u51c6\u4ee5\u4f30\u8ba1\u4f4d\u79fb\u573a\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u6750\u6599\u53ef\u538b\u7f29\u6027\uff1b\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u9636\u77e2\u91cf\u573a\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u6da1\u5ea6\uff09\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u5c40\u90e8\u4f4d\u79fb\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u5373\u4f7f\u56fe\u50cf\u914d\u51c6\u7ed3\u679c\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5c40\u90e8\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4ecd\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u6750\u6599\u53ef\u538b\u7f29\u6027\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u6e90\u4e8e\u5bf9\u9ad8\u9636\u8ba4\u77e5\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u4f4d\u79fb\u573a\u6da1\u5ea6\uff09\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u975e\u63a5\u89e6\u5f0f\u3001\u9ad8\u901a\u91cf\u6750\u6599\u529b\u5b66\u8868\u5f81\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u8fed\u4ee3\u6c42\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u3002"}}

We observe that symbolic differentiation provides a natural structure for verified decomposition: calculus rules explicitly define how expressions reduce to simpler components with provable properties. We introduce Verify-RL, a framework where every parent-child decomposition satisfies three verifiable conditions: strictly decreasing structural complexity, solution containment, and formal rule derivation.

We overcome obstacles that do not arise for the maximum to yield approximation results that are strictly stronger than those previously known for the maximum itself.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528ReLU\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8fd1\u4f3cd\u7ef4\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6-\u5bbd\u5ea6\u6743\u8861\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e38\u6570\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u7ebf\u6027\u5bbd\u5ea6\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u4f4d\u8d85\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u5c0f\u7684\u903c\u8fd1\u8bef\u5dee\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u503c\u5230\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u7684\u901a\u7528\u7ea6\u5316\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u5148\u524d\u5173\u4e8e\u6700\u5927\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u6240\u9700\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0b\u9650\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u969c\u788d\u3002", "motivation": "\u7a81\u7834\u5148\u524d\u5173\u4e8e\u6700\u5927\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u903c\u8fd1\u4e2d\u6df1\u5ea6-\u5bbd\u5ea6\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u8fd9\u4e00\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u903c\u8fd1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8fed\u4ee3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u5254\u9664\u975e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u56f4\u7ed5\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u7684\u5019\u9009\u96c6\uff1b\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4ece\u6700\u5927\u503c\u5230\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u6027\u7ea6\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5e38\u6570\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u7ebf\u6027\u5bbd\u5ea6\u7684ReLU\u7f51\u7edc\u5bf9\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u7684\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u7cbe\u5ea6\u903c\u8fd1\uff1b\u5176\u7ed3\u679c\u4e25\u683c\u5f3a\u4e8e\u6b64\u524d\u5173\u4e8e\u6700\u5927\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u5df2\u77e5\u903c\u8fd1\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u6bd4\u6700\u5927\u503c\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u903c\u8fd1\u610f\u4e49\u4e0a\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u8868\u793a\u6027\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6-\u5bbd\u5ea6\u6743\u8861\u5b58\u5728\u672c\u8d28\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4fee\u6b63\u4e86\u5bf9ReLU\u7f51\u7edc\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

However, existing forecasting systems often fail during high-impact periods such as flash sales, holiday campaigns, and sudden policy interventions, where demand patterns shift abruptly and unpredictably. In this paper, we introduce EventCast, a modular forecasting framework that integrates future event knowledge into time-series prediction. Unlike prior approaches that ignore future interventions or directly use large language models (LLMs) for numerical forecasting, EventCast leverages LLMs solely for event-driven reasoning. Unstructured business data, which covers campaigns, holiday schedules, and seller incentives, from existing operational databases, is processed by an LLM that converts it into interpretable textual summaries leveraging world knowledge for cultural nuances and novel event combinations. These summaries are fused with historical demand features within a dual-tower architecture, enabling accurate, explainable, and scalable forecasts. Deployed on real-world e-commerce scenarios spanning 4 countries of 160 regions over 10 months, EventCast achieves up to 86.9% and 97.7% improvement on MAE and MSE compared to the variant without event knowledge, and reduces MAE by up to 57.0% and MSE by 83.3% versus the best industrial baseline during event-driven periods. EventCast has deployed into real-world industrial pipelines since March 2025, offering a practical solution for improving operational decision-making in dynamic e-commerce environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faEventCast\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u672a\u6765\u4e8b\u4ef6\u77e5\u8bc6\u878d\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u9700\u6c42\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u63a8\u7406\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6587\u672c\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u518d\u4e0e\u5386\u53f2\u9700\u6c42\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7535\u5546\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9884\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u95ea\u8d2d\u3001\u8282\u5047\u65e5\u5927\u4fc3\u548c\u7a81\u53d1\u653f\u7b56\u5e72\u9884\u7b49\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cd\u65f6\u671f\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u56e0\u9700\u6c42\u6a21\u5f0f\u7a81\u53d8\u4e14\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "EventCast\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5854\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLM\u5bf9\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e1a\u52a1\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u4fc3\u9500\u3001\u8282\u5047\u65e5\u3001\u5356\u5bb6\u6fc0\u52b1\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u878d\u5408\u6587\u5316\u5e38\u8bc6\u548c\u65b0\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6587\u672c\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u5386\u53f2\u9700\u6c42\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8986\u76d64\u56fd160\u4e2a\u5730\u533a\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u7535\u5546\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f7210\u4e2a\u6708\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u65e0\u4e8b\u4ef6\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0cMAE\u548cMSE\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u534786.9%\u548c97.7%\uff1b\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u4f18\u5de5\u4e1a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u4e8b\u4ef6\u671f\u95f4MAE\u548cMSE\u5206\u522b\u964d\u4f4e57.0%\u548c83.3%\u3002", "conclusion": "EventCast\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u7535\u5546\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8fd0\u8425\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u5df2\u4e8e2025\u5e743\u6708\u6295\u5165\u5b9e\u9645\u5de5\u4e1a\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u4f7f\u7528\u3002"}}

It provides distinctive metrics for detecting symmetries and estimating orthogonal transformations, encompassing rotations, reflections, and their combinations. A comprehensive methodology is developed to obtain these functions in n-dimensional space, specifically moment \\( n \\)-tuples. Extensive validation tests are conducted on both 2D and 3D objects to ensure the robustness and reliability of the proposed approach.

Existing approaches rely on heuristic methods such as selecting recent interactions or prompting summarization models to compress user profiles. However, these methods treat context as a monolithic whole and fail to consider how LLMs internally process and prioritize different profile components. We investigate whether LLMs' attention patterns can effectively identify important personalization signals for intelligent context compression. Through preliminary studies on representative personalization tasks, we discover that (a) LLMs' attention patterns naturally reveal important signals, and (b) fine-tuning enhances LLMs' ability to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant information. Based on these insights, we propose Attn-GS, an attention-guided context compression framework that leverages attention feedback from a marking model to mark important personalization sentences, then guides a compression model to generate task-relevant, high-quality compressed user contexts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Attn-GS significantly outperforms various baselines across different tasks, token limits, and settings, achieving performance close to using full context while reducing token usage by 50 times.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAttn-GS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLM\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4etoken\u7528\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e2a\u6027\u5316LLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8f93\u5165token\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u7528\u6237\u957f\u5386\u53f2\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u753b\u50cf\uff1b\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565LLM\u5185\u90e8\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5904\u7406\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790LLM\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u53ef\u81ea\u7136\u63ed\u793a\u91cd\u8981\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5e76\u7ecf\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u589e\u5f3a\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u636e\u6b64\u8bbe\u8ba1Attn-GS\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7528\u6807\u8bb0\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53cd\u9988\u6807\u5b9a\u5173\u952e\u53e5\u5b50\uff0c\u518d\u7531\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u3001\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002", "result": "Attn-GS\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u3001token\u9650\u5236\u4e0e\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5404\u7c7b\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u4f7f\u7528\u5b8c\u6574\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06token\u7528\u91cf\u51cf\u5c1150\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u662f\u6307\u5bfc\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u6709\u6548\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0cAttn-GS\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u7528\u6237\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

For perceptual enhancement, quality-guided rewards are applied at later sampling steps to both synthetic and real LR images. To mitigate reward hacking, the rewards for synthetic results are formulated in a relative advantage space bounded by their clean counterparts, while real-world optimization is regularized via a semantic alignment constraint.

Current personalized multimodal models are predominantly static-concepts are fixed at initialization and cannot evolve during interactions. We propose M2A, an agentic dual-layer hybrid memory system that maintains personalized multimodal information through online updates. The system employs two collaborative agents: ChatAgent manages user interactions and autonomously decides when to query or update memory, while MemoryManager breaks down memory requests from ChatAgent into detailed operations on the dual-layer memory bank, which couples a RawMessageStore (immutable conversation log) with a SemanticMemoryStore (high-level observations), providing memories at different granularities. In addition, we develop a reusable data synthesis pipeline that injects concept-grounded sessions from Yo'LLaVA and MC-LLaVA into LoCoMo long conversations while preserving temporal coherence. Experiments show that M2A significantly outperforms baselines, demonstrating that transforming personalization from one-shot configuration to a co-evolving memory mechanism provides a viable path for high-quality individualized responses in long-term multimodal interactions.

However, this approach relies on standalone KV selection algorithms to select the KV entries used for drafting and overlooks that the criticality of each KV entry is inherently computed during verification.

A key challenge in this decentralized setting is perceptual misalignment across robots, where viewpoint differences and language ambiguity can yield inconsistent interpretations and degrade cooperative transport. To mitigate this problem, we adopt a dependent leader-follower design, where one robot serves as the leader and the other as the follower. Although such a leader-follower structure appears straightforward, learning with independent and symmetric agents often yields symmetric or unstable behaviors without explicit inductive biases. To address this challenge, we propose Consistent Leader-Follower (CoLF), a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for stable leader-follower role differentiation. CoLF consists of two key components: (1) an asymmetric policy design that induces leader-follower role differentiation, and (2) a mutual-information-based training objective that maximizes a variational lower bound, encouraging the follower to predict the leader's action from its local observation. The leader and follower policies are jointly optimized under the centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) framework to balance task execution and consistent cooperative behaviors. We validate CoLF in both simulation and real-robot experiments using two quadruped robots.

While recent work has identified structured, human-like conceptual representations within these models, it remains unclear whether they functionally rely on such representations for reasoning. Here we investigate the internal processing of LLMs during in-context concept inference. Our results reveal a conceptual subspace emerging in middle to late layers, whose representational structure persists across contexts. Using causal mediation analyses, we demonstrate that this subspace is not merely an epiphenomenon but is functionally central to model predictions, establishing its causal role in inference. We further identify a layer-wise progression where attention heads in early-to-middle layers integrate contextual cues to construct and refine the subspace, which is subsequently leveraged by later layers to generate predictions. Together, these findings provide evidence that LLMs dynamically construct and use structured, latent representations in context for inference, offering insights into the computational processes underlying flexible adaptation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6982\u5ff5\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u540e\u671f\u5c42\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u8de8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u3001\u529f\u80fd\u4e0a\u8d77\u56e0\u679c\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u5206\u5c42\u534f\u4f5c\u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u5229\u7528\u8be5\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u7c7b\u4eba\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7a81\u53d1\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e14\u5df2\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u5b58\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u7c7b\u4eba\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u771f\u6b63\u4f9d\u8d56\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790LLM\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6982\u5ff5\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u6982\u5ff5\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u56e0\u679c\u4e2d\u4ecb\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u56e0\u679c\u4f5c\u7528\uff1b\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5c42\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u5176\u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u4f7f\u7528\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u665a\u671f\u5c42\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u8de8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u8be5\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u5177\u6709\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u65e9\u671f\u81f3\u4e2d\u671f\u5c42\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u8d1f\u8d23\u6574\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4ee5\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u8be5\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u540e\u671f\u5c42\u5219\u5229\u7528\u5b83\u751f\u6210\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u5e76\u975e\u88ab\u52a8\u6fc0\u6d3b\u9884\u5b58\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u80fd\u52a8\u6001\u5730\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u5e76\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u5730\u4f7f\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u8868\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u7075\u6d3b\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u57fa\u7840\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8bc1\u636e\u3002"}}

In this paper, we present a new inference-time computing technique for on-device embodied AI, namely \\emph{MosaicThinker}, which enhances the on-device small VLM's spatial reasoning capabilities on difficult cross-frame reasoning tasks. Our basic idea is to integrate fragmented spatial information from multiple frames into a unified space representation of global semantic map, and further guide the VLM's spatial reasoning over the semantic map via a visual prompt.

These approaches often neglect the rich, multi-modal context of Polysomnography (PSG) and fail to capture the global macro-structure of a full night's sleep. To address this, we introduce SleepMaMi , a Sleep Foundation Model engineered to master both hour-long sleep architectures and fine-grained signal morphologies. Our framework utilizes a hierarchical dual-encoder design: a Macro-Encoder to model full-night temporal dependencies and a Micro-Encoder to capture short-term characteristics from biosignals.

However, the dynamic nature of emerging AI applications, the continual introduction of new datasets, and the growing number of models claiming superior performance make efficient and reliable validation of model services increasingly challenging. This motivates the development of sample-efficient performance estimators, which aim to estimate model performance by strategically selecting instances for labeling, thereby reducing annotation cost. Yet existing evaluation approaches often fail in low-variance settings: RMSE conflates bias and variance, masking persistent bias when variance is small, while p-value based tests become hypersensitive, rejecting adequate estimators for negligible deviations. To address this, we propose a fault-tolerant evaluation framework that integrates bias and variance considerations within an adjustable tolerance level ${\\varepsilon}$, enabling the evaluation of performance estimators within practically acceptable error margins. We theoretically show that proper calibration of ${\\varepsilon}$ ensures reliable evaluation across different variance regimes, and we further propose an algorithm that automatically optimizes and selects ${\\varepsilon}$.

Unlike simulation, real-world systems cannot be arbitrarily accelerated, cheaply reset, or massively replicated, which makes scalable data collection, heterogeneous deployment, and long-horizon effective training difficult. These challenges suggest that real-world policy learning is not only an algorithmic issue but fundamentally a systems problem. We present USER, a Unified and extensible SystEm for Real-world online policy learning. USER treats physical robots as first-class hardware resources alongside GPUs through a unified hardware abstraction layer, enabling automatic discovery, management, and scheduling of heterogeneous robots. To address cloud-edge communication, USER introduces an adaptive communication plane with tunneling-based networking, distributed data channels for traffic localization, and streaming-multiprocessor-aware weight synchronization to regulate GPU-side overhead. On top of this infrastructure, USER organizes learning as a fully asynchronous framework with a persistent, cache-aware buffer, enabling efficient long-horizon experiments with robust crash recovery and reuse of historical data. In addition, USER provides extensible abstractions for rewards, algorithms, and policies, supporting online imitation or reinforcement learning of CNN/MLP, generative policies, and large vision-language-action (VLA) models within a unified pipeline. Results in both simulation and the real world show that USER enables multi-robot coordination, heterogeneous manipulators, edge-cloud collaboration with large models, and long-running asynchronous training, offering a unified and extensible systems foundation for real-world online policy learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faUSER\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u5728\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u786c\u4ef6\u62bd\u8c61\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u901a\u4fe1\u5e73\u9762\u548c\u5f02\u6b65\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u534f\u540c\u3001\u5f02\u6784\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u3001\u8fb9\u7f18-\u4e91\u534f\u4f5c\u53ca\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u5f02\u6b65\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u96be\u3001\u90e8\u7f72\u5f02\u6784\u3001\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u56f0\u96be\u7b49\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7b97\u6cd5\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\uff0c\u9700\u4ece\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\u5c42\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u521b\u65b0\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86USER\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1\uff09\u7edf\u4e00\u786c\u4ef6\u62bd\u8c61\u5c42\uff0c\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0eGPU\u540c\u7b49\u7ba1\u7406\uff1b2\uff09\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u901a\u4fe1\u5e73\u9762\uff0c\u542b\u96a7\u9053\u7f51\u7edc\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u901a\u9053\u4e0e\u6d41\u5f0f\u591a\u5904\u7406\u5668\u611f\u77e5\u6743\u91cd\u540c\u6b65\uff1b3\uff09\u5168\u5f02\u6b65\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u914d\u5907\u6301\u4e45\u5316\u7f13\u5b58\u611f\u77e5\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u4e0e\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u590d\u7528\u673a\u5236\uff1b4\uff09\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u3001\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u62bd\u8c61\u63a5\u53e3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cUSER\u6210\u529f\u652f\u6301\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u534f\u540c\u3001\u5f02\u6784\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8fb9\u7f18-\u4e91\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u53ca\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u5f02\u6b65\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u7edf\u4e00\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "USER\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5728\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5c06\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e00\u7c7b\u6838\u5fc3\u786c\u4ef6\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4ece\u4eff\u771f\u8d70\u5411\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u843d\u5730\u3002"}}

However, their effectiveness in realistic user-engaged agent scenarios remains unclear. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on the effect of explicit thinking in user-engaged LLM agents. Our experiments span across seven models, three benchmarks, and two thinking instantiations, and we evaluate them through both a quantitative response taxonomy analysis and qualitative failure propagation case studies. Contrary to expectations, we find that mandatory thinking often backfires on agents in user-engaged settings, causing anomalous performance degradation across various LLMs. Our key finding reveals that thinking makes agents more ``introverted'' by shortening responses and reducing information disclosure to users, which weakens agent-user information exchange and leads to downstream task failures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that explicitly prompting for information disclosure reliably improves performance across diverse model families, suggesting that proactive transparency is a vital lever for agent optimization. Overall, our study suggests that information transparency awareness is a crucial yet underexplored perspective for the future design of reasoning agents in real-world scenarios.

To address this gap, we introduce \\textbf{WorldEdit}, a dataset specifically designed to enable world-driven image editing. WorldEdit consists of high-quality editing samples, guided by paraphrased instructions that align with real-world causal logic. Furthermore, we provide \\textbf{WorldEdit-Test} for evaluating the existing model's performance on causal editing scenarios. With WorldEdit, we use a two-stage training framework for fine-tuning models like Bagel, integrating with a causal verification reward.

These visual representations pose unique challenges for machine understanding, as they combine both structural and visual complexities.

However, a more practical scenario involves identifying and reasoning over relevant tables from large-scale collections to answer user queries. To address this gap, we propose TabRAG, a framework that enables MLLMs to answer queries over large collections of table images.

The framework instantiates core cerebellar principles, including high-dimensional pattern separation via fixed feature expansion, parallel microzone-style residual pathways, and local error-driven plasticity with excitatory and inhibitory eligibility traces operating at distinct time scales. These mechanisms enable fast, localized correction under post-training disturbances while avoiding destabilizing global policy updates.

While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enables variable computation, it scales memory linearly and is ill-suited for continuous action spaces. We introduce Recurrent-Depth VLA (RD-VLA), an architecture that achieves computational adaptivity via latent iterative refinement rather than explicit token generation. RD-VLA employs a recurrent, weight-tied action head that supports arbitrary inference depth with a constant memory footprint. The model is trained using truncated backpropagation through time (TBPTT) to efficiently supervise the refinement process. At inference, RD-VLA dynamically allocates compute using an adaptive stopping criterion based on latent convergence. Experiments on challenging manipulation tasks show that recurrent depth is critical: tasks that fail entirely (0 percent success) with single-iteration inference exceed 90 percent success with four iterations, while simpler tasks saturate rapidly. RD-VLA provides a scalable path to test-time compute in robotics, replacing token-based reasoning with latent reasoning to achieve constant memory usage and up to 80x inference speedup over prior reasoning-based VLA models.

Layer-wise pruning, a commonly employed strategy to mitigate inference costs, can partially address this challenge. However, existing approaches generally depend on static heuristic rules and fail to account for the interdependencies among layers, thereby limiting the effectiveness of the pruning process. To this end, this paper proposes a game-theoretic framework that formulates layer pruning as a cooperative game in which each layer acts as a player and model performance serves as the utility. As computing exact Shapley values is computationally infeasible for large language models (LLMs), we propose using a lightweight surrogate network to estimate layer-wise marginal contributions. This network can predict LLM performance for arbitrary layer combinations at a low computational cost.

However, existing approaches operate in raster space and rely on post hoc vectorization, which introduces structural inconsistencies and hinders end-to-end learning. Motivated by compositional spatial reasoning, we propose TLC-Plan, a hierarchical generative model that directly synthesizes vector floorplans from input boundaries, aligning with human architectural workflows based on modular and reusable patterns. TLC-Plan employs a two-level VQ-VAE to encode global layouts as semantically labeled room bounding boxes and to refine local geometries using polygon-level codes. This hierarchy is unified in a CodeTree representation, while an autoregressive transformer samples codes conditioned on the boundary to generate diverse and topologically valid designs, without requiring explicit room topology or dimensional priors. Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance on RPLAN dataset (FID = 1.84, MSE = 2.06) and leading results on LIFULL dataset.

Some examples are advances in artificial intelligence that make machines more and more humanlike, and the introduction of decentralized technologies (e.g. blockchains), which creates new forms of (decentralized) trust. These new developments have the potential to improve the provision of products and services, as well as to contribute to individual and collective well-being. However, their adoption depends largely on trust. In order to build trustworthy systems, along with defining laws, regulations and proper governance models for new forms of trust, it is necessary to properly conceptualize trust, so that it can be understood both by humans and machines. This paper is the culmination of a long-term research program of providing a solid ontological foundation on trust, by creating reference conceptual models to support information modeling, automated reasoning, information integration and semantic interoperability tasks. To address this, a Reference Ontology of Trust (ONTrust) was developed, grounded on the Unified Foundational Ontology and specified in OntoUML, which has been applied in several initiatives, to demonstrate, for example, how it can be used for conceptual modeling and enterprise architecture design, for language evaluation and (re)design, for trust management, for requirements engineering, and for trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) in the context of affective Human-AI teaming. ONTrust formally characterizes the concept of trust and its different types, describes the different factors that can influence trust, as well as explains how risk emerges from trust relations. To illustrate the working of ONTrust, the ontology is applied to model two case studies extracted from the literature.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7edf\u4e00\u57fa\u7840\u672c\u4f53\uff08UFO\uff09\u548cOntoUML\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u4fe1\u4efb\u672c\u4f53ONTrust\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u4fe1\u4efb\u63d0\u4f9b\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4fe1\u606f\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u53ef\u4fe1AI\u3001\u4f01\u4e1a\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b49\uff09\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u548c\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982\u533a\u5757\u94fe\uff09\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u65b0\u578b\u2018\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u4fe1\u4efb\u2019\u6d8c\u73b0\uff0c\u5176\u91c7\u7eb3\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5bf9\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0e\u5efa\u6a21\uff1b\u5f53\u524d\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u88ab\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u5171\u540c\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7edf\u4e00\u57fa\u7840\u672c\u4f53\uff08UFO\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528OntoUML\u8bed\u8a00\u6784\u5efa\u53c2\u8003\u4fe1\u4efb\u672c\u4f53ONTrust\uff0c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u523b\u753b\u4fe1\u4efb\u6982\u5ff5\u3001\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\u53ca\u4fe1\u4efb\u5173\u7cfb\u4e2d\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u4ea7\u751f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u6587\u732e\u6848\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5f00\u53d1\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86ONTrust\u672c\u4f53\uff0c\u5df2\u5728\u53ef\u4fe1AI\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u60c5\u611f\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\uff09\u3001\u4f01\u4e1a\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u91cd\u6784\u3001\u4fe1\u4efb\u7ba1\u7406\u3001\u9700\u6c42\u5de5\u7a0b\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u8de8\u57df\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "ONTrust\u4e3a\u4fe1\u4efb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e25\u8c28\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6df1\u5316\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u6570\u5b57\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u5efa\u6a21\u652f\u6491\u3002"}}

Calmon"], "title": "ArcMark: Multi-bit LLM Watermark via Optimal Transport", "comment": null, "summary": "Watermarking is an important tool for promoting the responsible use of language models (LMs). Existing watermarks insert a signal into generated tokens that either flags LM-generated text (zero-bit watermarking) or encodes more complex messages (multi-bit watermarking). Though a number of recent multi-bit watermarks insert several bits into text without perturbing average next-token predictions, they largely extend design principles from the zero-bit setting, such as encoding a single bit per token. Notably, the information-theoretic capacity of multi-bit watermarking -- the maximum number of bits per token that can be inserted and detected without changing average next-token predictions -- has remained unknown. We address this gap by deriving the first capacity characterization of multi-bit watermarks. Our results inform the design of ArcMark: a new watermark construction based on coding-theoretic principles that, under certain assumptions, achieves the capacity of the multi-bit watermark channel. In practice, ArcMark outperforms competing multi-bit watermarks in terms of bit rate per token and detection accuracy. Our work demonstrates that LM watermarking is fundamentally a channel coding problem, paving the way for principled coding-theoretic approaches to watermark design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ArcMark\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f16\u7801\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u591a\u6bd4\u7279\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u523b\u753b\u4e86\u591a\u6bd4\u7279\u6c34\u5370\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u5bb9\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u79cd\u591a\u6bd4\u7279\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\u6cbf\u7528\u96f6\u6bd4\u7279\u6c34\u5370\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u601d\u8def\uff08\u5982\u6bcftoken\u7f16\u78011\u6bd4\u7279\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u5bb9\u91cf\uff08\u5373\u5728\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u5e73\u5747\u4e0b\u4e00\u8bcd\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u53ef\u5d4c\u5165\u5e76\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6700\u5927\u6bd4\u7279\u6570\uff09\u5c1a\u672a\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u591a\u6bd4\u7279\u6c34\u5370\u4fe1\u9053\u7684\u5bb9\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f16\u7801\u7406\u8bba\u7684ArcMark\u6c34\u5370\u6784\u9020\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u4e25\u683c\u610f\u4e49\u4e0a\u7684\u591a\u6bd4\u7279\u6c34\u5370\u5bb9\u91cf\u523b\u753b\uff1bArcMark\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u76f8\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u591a\u6bd4\u7279\u6c34\u5370\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6bd4\u7279\u7387/Token\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6c34\u5370\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4fe1\u9053\u7f16\u7801\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e94\u91c7\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u7406\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

A Study on the Effect of Images on Clarifying Questions in Conversational Search", "comment": "Accepted at CHIIR 2025", "summary": "Conversational search systems increasingly employ clarifying questions to refine user queries and improve the search experience. Previous studies have demonstrated the usefulness of text-based clarifying questions in enhancing both retrieval performance and user experience. While images have been shown to improve retrieval performance in various contexts, their impact on user performance when incorporated into clarifying questions remains largely unexplored. We conduct a user study with 73 participants to investigate the role of images in conversational search, specifically examining their effects on two search-related tasks: (i) answering clarifying questions and (ii) query reformulation. We compare the effect of multimodal and text-only clarifying questions in both tasks within a conversational search context from various perspectives. Our findings reveal that while participants showed a strong preference for multimodal questions when answering clarifying questions, preferences were more balanced in the query reformulation task. The impact of images varied with both task type and user expertise. In answering clarifying questions, images helped maintain engagement across different expertise levels, while in query reformulation they led to more precise queries and improved retrieval performance. Interestingly, for clarifying question answering, text-only setups demonstrated better user performance as they provided more comprehensive textual information in the absence of images. These results provide valuable insights for designing effective multimodal conversational search systems, highlighting that the benefits of visual augmentation are task-dependent and should be strategically implemented based on the specific search context and user characteristics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\u4e2d\uff0c\u56fe\u6587\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u6f84\u6e05\u95ee\u9898\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u6f84\u6e05\u95ee\u9898\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u56e0\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u7528\u6237\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u6c34\u5e73\u800c\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6587\u672c\u6f84\u6e05\u95ee\u9898\u5df2\u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u4f46\u56fe\u50cf\u5728\u6f84\u6e05\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u7528\u6237\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u5c55\u4e86\u4e00\u9879\u5305\u542b73\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u56fe\u6587\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e0e\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u6f84\u6e05\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u56de\u7b54\u6f84\u6e05\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u67e5\u8be2\u91cd\u6784\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u591a\u4e2a\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u56fe\u50cf\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u5728\u56de\u7b54\u6f84\u6e05\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u67e5\u8be2\u91cd\u6784\u4e2d\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u4f46\u5728\u56de\u7b54\u6f84\u6e05\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\uff0c\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u56e0\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6587\u5b57\u4fe1\u606f\u53cd\u800c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7528\u6237\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6548\u679c\u5177\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u5e94\u6839\u636e\u5177\u4f53\u641c\u7d22\u573a\u666f\u548c\u7528\u6237\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

In biplanar X ray guided navigation, such pipelines are widely used due to their real time capability and geometric interpretability. However, navigation reliability can be constrained by an overlooked system level failure mechanism in which installation induced structural perturbations introduced at the perception stage are progressively amplified along the perception reconstruction execution chain and dominate execution level error and tail risk behavior. This paper investigates this mechanism from a system level perspective and presents a unified error propagation modeling framework that characterizes how installation induced structural perturbations propagate and couple with pixel level observation noise through biplanar imaging, projection matrix estimation, triangulation, and coordinate mapping. Using first order analytic uncertainty propagation and Monte Carlo simulations, we analyze dominant sensitivity channels and quantify worst case error behavior beyond mean accuracy metrics. The results show that rotational installation error is a primary driver of system level error amplification, while translational misalignment of comparable magnitude plays a secondary role under typical biplanar geometries. Real biplanar X ray bench top experiments further confirm that the predicted amplification trends persist under realistic imaging conditions. These findings reveal a broader structural limitation of reference based multi stage geometric perception pipelines and provide a framework for system level reliability analysis and risk aware design in safety critical robotic navigation systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u53cc\u5e73\u9762X\u5c04\u7ebf\u5f15\u5bfc\u5bfc\u822a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7531\u5b89\u88c5\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6270\u52a8\u5728\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u9010\u7ea7\u653e\u5927\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u5931\u6548\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u6790\u548c\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8bef\u5dee\u654f\u611f\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u65cb\u8f6c\u5b89\u88c5\u8bef\u5dee\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u653e\u5927\u6e90\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u53cc\u5e73\u9762X\u5c04\u7ebf\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b89\u88c5\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6270\u52a8\u5728\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u611f\u77e5\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u88ab\u9010\u6b65\u653e\u5927\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6267\u884c\u5c42\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u5c3e\u90e8\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4f46\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u5931\u6548\u673a\u5236\u5e38\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u523b\u753b\u5b89\u88c5\u6270\u52a8\u4e0e\u50cf\u7d20\u89c2\u6d4b\u566a\u58f0\u5728\u53cc\u5e73\u9762\u6210\u50cf\u3001\u6295\u5f71\u77e9\u9635\u4f30\u8ba1\u3001\u4e09\u89d2\u6d4b\u91cf\u53ca\u5750\u6807\u6620\u5c04\u5404\u73af\u8282\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u4e0e\u8026\u5408\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u4e00\u9636\u89e3\u6790\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u5ea6\u4f20\u64ad\u4e0e\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u4eff\u771f\u5206\u6790\u4e3b\u5bfc\u654f\u611f\u901a\u9053\u548c\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u65cb\u8f6c\u5b89\u88c5\u8bef\u5dee\u662f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u8bef\u5dee\u653e\u5927\u7684\u4e3b\u56e0\uff0c\u5e73\u79fb\u9519\u4f4d\u5f71\u54cd\u6b21\u4e4b\uff1b\u771f\u5b9e\u53cc\u5e73\u9762X\u5c04\u7ebf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u653e\u5927\u8d8b\u52bf\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6210\u50cf\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4f9d\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u6709\u7ed3\u6784\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u578b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

We probe the hidden states of several smaller open-source LLMs. A single linear projection of an appropriate hidden layer encodes the log-magnitudes of both kinds of numerals, allowing us to recover the numbers with relative error of about 2.3% (on restricted synthetic text) or 19.06% (on scientific papers). Furthermore, the hidden state after reading a pair of numerals encodes their ranking, with a linear classifier achieving over 90% accuracy. Yet surprisingly, when explicitly asked to rank the same pairs of numerals, these LLMs achieve only 50-70% accuracy, with worse performance for models whose probes are less effective. Finally, we show that incorporating the classifier probe's log-loss as an auxiliary objective during finetuning brings an additional 3.22% improvement in verbalized accuracy over base models, demonstrating that improving models' internal magnitude representations can enhance their numerical reasoning capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6df7\u5408\u8bb0\u6cd5\u6570\u503c\u6bd4\u8f83\u65f6\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u6570\u503c\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u9690\u85cf\u5c42\u80fd\u7ebf\u6027\u7f16\u7801\u6570\u503c\u5bf9\u6570\u5927\u5c0f\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u5927\u5c0f\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4f46\u663e\u5f0f\u56de\u7b54\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u63a2\u9488\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u635f\u5931\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u76ee\u6807\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u6570\u503c\u63a8\u7406\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5148\u8fdb\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u89e3\u6570\u5b66\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u8bb0\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u79d1\u5b66\u8ba1\u6570\u6cd5\u4e0e\u5341\u8fdb\u5236\uff09\u7684\u6570\u503c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u5bf9\u5176\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u7406\u89e3\u6570\u503c\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u6839\u672c\u8d28\u7591\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u591a\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u63a2\u9488\u5206\u6790\uff1a\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u7ebf\u6027\u6295\u5f71\u4ece\u9002\u5f53\u9690\u85cf\u5c42\u63d0\u53d6\u6570\u503c\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5224\u65ad\u4e24\u6570\u5927\u5c0f\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5c06\u8be5\u63a2\u9488\u7684log-loss\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u635f\u5931\u7528\u4e8e\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u9690\u85cf\u5c42\u53ef\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6062\u590d\u6570\u503c\uff08\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee2.3%~19.06%\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u4ee5>90%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7f16\u7801\u6570\u503c\u5927\u5c0f\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u5f0f\u56de\u7b54\u4ec550\u201370%\u51c6\u786e\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u8f85\u52a9\u76ee\u6807\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u56de\u7b54\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u989d\u5916\u63d0\u53473.22%\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u5185\u90e8\u5df2\u5177\u5907\u4e00\u5b9a\u6570\u503c\u5927\u5c0f\u8868\u5f81\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u8be5\u80fd\u529b\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u8c03\u7528\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\uff1b\u663e\u5f0f\u6027\u80fd\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u5f97\u5230\u6539\u5584\u3002"}}

While 3D Gaussian Splatting enables photorealistic scene reconstruction from real-world data, existing methods inherently couple static lighting with geometry, severely limiting policy generalization to dynamic real-world illumination. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end reinforcement learning framework designed for effective zero-shot transfer to unstructured outdoors. Within a high-fidelity simulation grounded in real-world data, our policy is trained to map raw monocular RGB observations directly to continuous control commands. To overcome photometric limitations, we introduce Relightable 3D Gaussian Splatting, which decomposes scene components to enable explicit, physically grounded editing of environmental lighting within the neural representation. By augmenting training with diverse synthesized lighting conditions ranging from strong directional sunlight to diffuse overcast skies, we compel the policy to learn robust, illumination-invariant visual features.

However, existing GNNs often struggle with heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes tend to have dissimilar features or labels. While numerous methods have been proposed to address this challenge, they primarily focus on architectural designs without directly targeting the root cause of the heterophily problem. These approaches still perform even worse than the simplest MLPs on challenging heterophilic datasets. For instance, our experiments show that 21 latest GNNs still fall behind the MLP on the Actor dataset. This critical challenge calls for an innovative approach to addressing graph heterophily beyond architectural designs. To bridge this gap, we propose and study a new and unexplored paradigm: directly increasing the graph homophily via a carefully designed graph transformation. In this work, we present a simple yet effective framework called GRAPHITE to address graph heterophily. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first method that explicitly transforms the graph to directly improve the graph homophily. Stemmed from the exact definition of homophily, our proposed GRAPHITE creates feature nodes to facilitate homophilic message passing between nodes that share similar features. Furthermore, we both theoretically and empirically show that our proposed GRAPHITE significantly increases the homophily of originally heterophilic graphs, with only a slight increase in the graph size.

Yet, automated systems that extract locations from text often reproduce existing geographic and socioeconomic biases, leading to uneven visibility of crisis-affected regions. This paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can address these geographic disparities in extracting location information from humanitarian documents. We introduce a two-step framework that combines few-shot LLM-based named entity recognition with an agent-based geocoding module that leverages context to resolve ambiguous toponyms. We benchmark our approach against state-of-the-art pretrained and rule-based systems using both accuracy and fairness metrics across geographic and socioeconomic dimensions. Our evaluation uses an extended version of the HumSet dataset with refined literal toponym annotations. Results show that LLM-based methods substantially improve both the precision and fairness of geolocation extraction from humanitarian texts, particularly for underrepresented regions.

In this paper, we present a geometric error propagation framework for camera pose estimation based on a parallel perspective approximation. By explicitly modeling how image measurement errors propagate through perspective geometry, we derive an error transfer model that characterizes the relationship between feature point distribution, camera depth, and pose estimation uncertainty. Building on this analysis, we develop a pose estimation method that leverages parallel perspective initialization and error-aware weighting within a Gauss-Newton optimization scheme, leading to improved robustness in proximity operations. Extensive experiments on both synthetic data and real-world images, covering diverse conditions such as strong illumination, surgical lighting, and underwater low-light environments, demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves accuracy and robustness comparable to state-of-the-art analytic and iterative PnP methods, while maintaining high computational efficiency.

Leveraging PlanFactory, we collect high-quality planning trajectories and train Todo-14B via \\textit{Impedance-Guided Preference Optimization} (IGPO), a multi-objective reinforcement learning objective that encourages the generation of planning systems that are performant, stable, and token-efficient across arbitrary tasks and agent backbones.

When MLLMs reason over camera-captured views of the physical world, a new attack surface emerges: an attacker can place text-bearing physical objects in the environment to override MLLMs' intended task. While prior work has studied prompt injection in the text domain and through digitally edited 2D images, it remains unclear how these attacks function in 3D physical environments. To bridge the gap, we introduce PI3D, a prompt injection attack against MLLMs in 3D environments, realized through text-bearing physical object placement rather than digital image edits. We formulate and solve the problem of identifying an effective 3D object pose (position and orientation) with injected text, where the attacker's goal is to induce the MLLM to perform the injected task while ensuring that the object placement remains physically plausible.

Nevertheless, current inverse graphics methods face tremendous challenges in accurately reconstructing complex geometric details, which often results in the loss of key geometric constraints or structural distortion. To address this bottleneck, we propose Geo-coder -- the first inverse programming framework for geometric images based on a multi-agent system. Our method innovatively decouples the process into geometric modeling via pixel-wise anchoring and metric-driven code evolution: Stage 1 leverages the complementary advantages of visual operators and large models to achieve precise capture of pixel coordinates and visual attributes; Stage 2 introduces a synthesis-rendering-validation closed loop, where bidirectional visual feedback drives the self-correction of code. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Geo-coder achieves a substantial lead in both geometric reconstruction accuracy and visual consistency. Notably, by effectively preserving the core geometric semantics, the images reconstructed with our method exhibit equivalent performance to the original ones in multimodal reasoning tasks, which fully validates the robustness of the framework. Finally, to further reduce research costs, we have open-sourced the Geo-coder dataset constructed on the GeoCode framework, which contains more than 1,500 samples. On this basis, we have also open-sourced the GeocodeLM model, laying a solid data and model foundation for subsequent research in this field.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faGeo-coder\uff0c\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u56fe\u50cf\u9006\u7f16\u7a0b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u50cf\u7d20\u951a\u5b9a\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u5ea6\u91cf\u9a71\u52a8\u4ee3\u7801\u6f14\u5316\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u63d0\u5347\u51e0\u4f55\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9006\u56fe\u5f62\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u91cd\u5efa\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u6613\u4e22\u5931\u5173\u952e\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\u6216\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5931\u771f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGeo-coder\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u7b97\u5b50\u4e0e\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u540c\u5b9e\u73b0\u50cf\u7d20\u5750\u6807\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u6355\u83b7\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u6784\u5efa\u5408\u6210-\u6e32\u67d3-\u9a8c\u8bc1\u95ed\u73af\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53cc\u5411\u89c6\u89c9\u53cd\u9988\u9a71\u52a8\u4ee3\u7801\u81ea\u6821\u6b63\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u91cd\u5efa\u56fe\u50cf\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u50cf\u76f8\u5f53\uff1b\u5f00\u6e90\u542b1500+\u6837\u672c\u7684Geo-coder\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53caGeocodeLM\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "Geo-coder\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u7559\u6838\u5fc3\u51e0\u4f55\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9006\u56fe\u5f62\u5b66\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

The fidelity of these maps is paramount, as an accurate environmental representation is a prerequisite for stable and precise localization. Factor graphs provide a powerful approach for sensor fusion, enabling the estimation of the maximum a posteriori solution. However, the discrete nature of graph-based representations, combined with asynchronous sensor measurements, complicates consistent state estimation. The design of an optimal factor graph topology remains an open challenge, especially in multi-sensor systems with asynchronous data. Conventional approaches rely on a rigid graph structure, which becomes inefficient with sensors of disparate rates. Although preintegration techniques can mitigate this for high-rate sensors, their applicability is limited. To address this problem, this work introduces a novel approach that incrementally constructs connected factor graphs, ensuring the incorporation of all available sensor data by choosing the optimal graph topology based on the external evaluation criteria. The proposed methodology facilitates graph compression, reducing the number of nodes (optimized variables) by ~30% on average while maintaining map quality at a level comparable to conventional approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u589e\u91cf\u6784\u5efa\u8fde\u901a\u56e0\u5b50\u56fe\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u90e8\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u56fe\u62d3\u6251\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5f02\u6b65\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5efa\u56fe\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u4f18\u5316\u53d8\u91cf\uff08\u8282\u70b9\uff09\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea630%\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u56e0\u5b50\u56fe\u5728\u5904\u7406\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5f02\u6b65\u6d4b\u91cf\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u50f5\u5316\u3001\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u9891\u7387\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\u65f6\uff1b\u9884\u79ef\u5206\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u9002\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e14\u6700\u4f18\u56fe\u62d3\u6251\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ecd\u662f\u5f00\u653e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u589e\u91cf\u5f0f\u8fde\u901a\u56e0\u5b50\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f9d\u636e\u5916\u90e8\u8bc4\u4f30\u51c6\u5219\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u56fe\u62d3\u6251\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6240\u6709\u53ef\u7528\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u88ab\u7eb3\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u56fe\u538b\u7f29\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e73\u5747\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5c06\u4f18\u5316\u53d8\u91cf\uff08\u8282\u70b9\uff09\u6570\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea630%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5efa\u56fe\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f02\u6b65\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u56e0\u5b50\u56fe\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u5efa\u56fe\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

In this paper, we show that these methods break down in the presence of multiple valid answers, where disagreement among equally correct responses leads to systematic underestimation of confidence. To enable a systematic study of this phenomenon, we introduce MACE, a benchmark of 12,000 factual questions spanning six domains with varying numbers of correct answers. Experiments across 15 representative calibration methods and four LLM families (7B-72B) reveal that while accuracy increases with answer cardinality, estimated confidence consistently decreases, causing severe miscalibration for questions with mixed answer counts. To address this issue, we propose Semantic Confidence Aggregation (SCA), which aggregates confidence over multiple high-probability sampled responses. SCA achieves state-of-the-art calibration performance under mixed-answer settings while preserving strong calibration on single-answer questions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u7b54\u6848\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5931\u6548\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MACE\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u805a\u5408\uff08SCA\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u7b54\u6848\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bad\u7ec3-free\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u7b54\u6848\u95ee\u7b54\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u65f6\u56e0\u7b54\u6848\u95f4\u5206\u6b67\u5bfc\u81f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4f4e\u4f30\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u591a\u7b54\u6848\u573a\u666f\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMACE\u57fa\u51c6\uff08\u542b12,000\u4e2a\u8de86\u9886\u57df\u3001\u7b54\u6848\u6570\u91cf\u53ef\u53d8\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1Semantic Confidence Aggregation\uff08SCA\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u2014\u2014\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u591a\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u91c7\u6837\u54cd\u5e94\u8fdb\u884c\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u805a\u5408\u6765\u6821\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8986\u76d615\u79cd\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e4\u7c7bLLM\uff087B\u201372B\uff09\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u968f\u7b54\u6848\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u4f30\u8ba1\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5374\u6301\u7eed\u4e0b\u964d\uff1bSCA\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u7b54\u6848\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5355\u7b54\u6848\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5f3a\u6821\u51c6\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u7b54\u6848\u573a\u666f\u663e\u8457\u6311\u6218\u73b0\u6709\u6821\u51c6\u8303\u5f0f\uff0cSCA\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u805a\u5408\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

A key challenge arises from the representation mismatch between discrete, token-level semantic reasoning in LLMs and the dense, fine-grained temporal dynamics required for 3D facial motion, which makes direct modeling difficult to optimize under limited data. We propose Expressive Omni (Ex-Omni), an open-source omni-modal framework that augments OLLMs with speech-accompanied 3D facial animation. Ex-Omni reduces learning difficulty by decoupling semantic reasoning from temporal generation, leveraging speech units as temporal scaffolding and a unified token-as-query gated fusion (TQGF) mechanism for controlled semantic injection. We further introduce InstructEx, a dataset aims to facilitate augment OLLMs with speech-accompanied 3D facial animation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ex-Omni performs competitively against existing open-source OLLMs while enabling stable aligned speech and facial animation generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faEx-Omni\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u97f3\u5355\u5143\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65f6\u5e8f\u652f\u67b6\u53caTQGF\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u97f3\u9a71\u52a8\u76843D\u9762\u90e8\u52a8\u753b\u751f\u6210\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u53d1\u5e03InstructEx\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5f00\u6e90OLLM\u5728\u8bed\u97f3-\u9762\u90e8\u534f\u540c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Omni-modal\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08OLLMs\uff09\u5c1a\u672a\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u8bed\u97f3\u4e0e3D\u9762\u90e8\u52a8\u753b\uff0c\u800c\u4e8c\u8005\u5bf9\u81ea\u7136\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff1b\u6838\u5fc3\u96be\u70b9\u5728\u4e8eLLM\u79bb\u6563token\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u5f81\u4e0e3D\u9762\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u6240\u9700\u7a20\u5bc6\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u65f6\u5e8f\u52a8\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEx-Omni\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u89e3\u8026\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u65f6\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\uff1b2\uff09\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u97f3\u5355\u5143\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65f6\u5e8f\u652f\u67b6\uff1b3\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7edf\u4e00\u7684token-as-query\u95e8\u63a7\u878d\u5408\uff08TQGF\uff09\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u63a7\u8bed\u4e49\u6ce8\u5165\uff1b\u5e76\u6784\u5efaInstructEx\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u652f\u6301\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "Ex-Omni\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u6e90OLLMs\uff0c\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u97f3\u4e0e3D\u9762\u90e8\u52a8\u753b\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "Ex-Omni\u4e3aOLLMs\u6269\u5c55\u8bed\u97f3-3D\u9762\u90e8\u534f\u540c\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u5f00\u6e90\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u89e3\u8026\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u65f6\u5e8f\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

While recent advances enable batching (co-locating) multiple adapters during serving, efficient training-time co-location of heterogeneous LoRA adapters presents unique challenges. Jobs often differ in adapter rank, batch size, and resource allocation, and na\u00efve batching can introduce synchronization stalls, communication overheads, and per-job slowdowns that are worse than executing independently. We introduce tLoRA, a framework that enables efficient batch training of multiple LoRA jobs. tLoRA fuses adapters that share the same base model into an elastic shared super-model, exploiting existing distributed training frameworks to derive parallelism plans that share resources effectively. At the kernel level, tLoRA employs a fused LoRA kernel that adaptively reconstructs low-rank computation tiles and schedules rank-aware nano-batches to maximize overlap between computation and communication across adapters. At the scheduling layer, tLoRA incorporates an online, residual-capacity-aware scheduler that adaptively groups jobs to maximize collective throughput. Evaluations using real-world cluster traces demonstrate that tLoRA improves training throughput by 1.2--1.8x, job training completion time by 2.3--5.4x, and GPU utilization by 37%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86tLoRA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u5171\u4eab\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684LoRA\u9002\u914d\u5668\u3001\u8bbe\u8ba1\u878d\u5408LoRA\u6838\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u7ebf\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u6279\u91cf\u6267\u884c\u591a\u4e2a\u5f02\u6784LoRA\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3001\u7f29\u77ed\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8GPU\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LoRA\u6210\u4e3a\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5171\u4eab\u96c6\u7fa4\u4e2d\u5e38\u9700\u5e76\u53d1\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u4e2aLoRA\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u96be\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u5171\u7f6e\u5f02\u6784LoRA\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u540c\u6b65\u963b\u585e\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u589e\u5927\u548c\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u53d8\u6162\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "tLoRA\u6784\u5efa\u5f39\u6027\u5171\u4eab\u8d85\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u878d\u5408\u540c\u57fa\u5ea7\u7684LoRA\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f4e\u79e9\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u5757\u4e0erank\u611f\u77e5\u7eb3\u7c73\u6279\u6b21\u7684\u878d\u5408LoRA\u6838\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u5728\u7ebf\u6b8b\u5dee\u5bb9\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u7ec4\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u96c6\u7fa4\u8f68\u8ff9\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0ctLoRA\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u53471.2\u20131.8\u500d\u3001\u4f5c\u4e1a\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u77ed2.3\u20135.4\u500d\u3001GPU\u5229\u7528\u7387\u63d0\u534737%\u3002", "conclusion": "tLoRA\u4e3a\u591aLoRA\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u534f\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8LoRA\u5728\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

This paper gives a formal problem definition, proves NP-hardness by reduction from the Weighted Set Packing problem, and derives a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization formulation whose coefficients directly encode unique coverage rewards and pairwise overlap penalties. A single penalty parameter controls the coverage-overlap trade-off. We distinguish between a soft regime, which supports multi-objective exploration, and a hard regime, in which the penalty is strong enough to effectively enforce near-disjoint routes. We describe a practical pipeline for generating city instances, constructing candidate routes, building the QUBO matrix, and solving it with an exact mixed-integer solver (Gurobi), simulated annealing, and D-Wave hybrid quantum annealing. Experiments on Barcelona instances with up to 10 000 vehicles reveal a clear coverage-overlap knee and show that Pareto-optimal solutions are mainly obtained under the hard-penalty regime, while D-Wave hybrid solvers and Gurobi achieve essentially identical objective values with only minor differences in runtime as problem size grows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eQUBO\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u5178\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u5347\u9053\u8def\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u5e76\u9650\u5236\u8def\u5f84\u91cd\u53e0\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u8f66\u8f86\u8def\u5f84\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "method": "\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eNP\u96be\u6027\uff1b\u6784\u5efaQUBO\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5355\u4e00\u60e9\u7f5a\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u63a7\u8986\u76d6-\u91cd\u53e0\u6743\u8861\uff1b\u533a\u5206\u8f6f/\u786c\u60e9\u7f5a\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5305\u542b\u5b9e\u4f8b\u751f\u6210\u3001\u5019\u9009\u8def\u5f84\u6784\u9020\u3001QUBO\u77e9\u9635\u6784\u5efa\u53ca\u591a\u79cd\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff08Gurobi\u3001\u6a21\u62df\u9000\u706b\u3001D-Wave\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\uff09\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6c42\u89e3\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5df4\u585e\u7f57\u90a3\u57ce\u5e02\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff08\u6700\u591a10,000\u8f86\u8f66\uff09\u4e0a\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u660e\u663e\u7684\u8986\u76d6-\u91cd\u53e0\u6743\u8861\u62d0\u70b9\uff1bPareto\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u4e3b\u8981\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u786c\u60e9\u7f5a\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\uff1bD-Wave\u6df7\u5408\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u4e0eGurobi\u83b7\u5f97\u51e0\u4e4e\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u503c\uff0c\u4ec5\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5fae\u5c0f\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5QUBO\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e0d\u76f8\u4ea4\u8def\u5f84\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u6df7\u5408\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

In this paper, we revisit the model-item performance matrix and show that it exhibits sparsity, that representative items can be selected as anchors, and that the task of efficient benchmarking can be formulated as a sparse optimization problem. Based on these insights, we propose SparseEval, a method that, for the first time, adopts gradient descent to optimize anchor weights and employs an iterative refinement strategy for anchor selection. We utilize the representation capacity of MLP to handle sparse optimization and propose the Anchor Importance Score and Candidate Importance Score to evaluate the value of each item for task-aware refinement.

To address this limitation, agentic systems commonly incorporate memory modules to retain and reuse past experience, aiming for continual learning during test time. However, most existing memory designs are human-crafted and fixed, which limits their ability to adapt to the diversity and non-stationarity of real-world tasks. In this paper, we introduce ALMA (Automated meta-Learning of Memory designs for Agentic systems), a framework that meta-learns memory designs to replace hand-engineered memory designs, therefore minimizing human effort and enabling agentic systems to be continual learners across diverse domains. Our approach employs a Meta Agent that searches over memory designs expressed as executable code in an open-ended manner, theoretically allowing the discovery of arbitrary memory designs, including database schemas as well as their retrieval and update mechanisms. Extensive experiments across four sequential decision-making domains demonstrate that the learned memory designs enable more effective and efficient learning from experience than state-of-the-art human-crafted memory designs on all benchmarks.

In this work, we address this gap from a mechanistic point of view by investigating how instruction-specific representations are constructed and utilized in different stages of post-training: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Via causal mediation, we identify that instruction representation is fairly localized in models. These representations, which we call Instruction Vectors (IVs), demonstrate a curious juxtaposition of linear separability along with non-linear causal interaction, broadly questioning the scope of the linear representation hypothesis commonplace in mechanistic interpretability. To disentangle the non-linear causal interaction, we propose a novel method to localize information processing in language models that is free from the implicit linear assumptions of patching-based techniques. We find that, conditioned on the task representations formed in the early layers, different information pathways are selected in the later layers to solve that task, i.e., IVs act as circuit selectors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u673a\u5236\u89d2\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u5982\u4f55\u5904\u7406\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6307\u4ee4\u8868\u793a\uff08Instruction Vectors, IVs\uff09\u5177\u6709\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u3001\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u5206\u4f46\u53c8\u5b58\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u56e0\u679c\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u514d\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793aIVs\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8d77\u7535\u8def\u9009\u62e9\u5668\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u5982\u4f55\u5904\u7406\u6307\u4ee4\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u4ece\u673a\u5236\u5c42\u9762\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u56e0\u679c\u4e2d\u4ecb\u5206\u6790\u8bc6\u522b\u6307\u4ee4\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ebf\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408SFT\u4e0eDPO\u9636\u6bb5\u5206\u6790\u6307\u4ee4\u5411\u91cf\uff08IVs\uff09\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6307\u4ee4\u8868\u793a\uff08IVs\uff09\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u4e0e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u56e0\u679c\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1b\u9a8c\u8bc1IVs\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u5f62\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u5f81\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u540e\u671f\u5c42\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u4e0d\u540c\u4fe1\u606f\u901a\u8def\uff0c\u5373\u5145\u5f53\u2018\u7535\u8def\u9009\u62e9\u5668\u2019\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6307\u4ee4\u8868\u793a\u5e76\u975e\u7b80\u5355\u7ebf\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5176\u529f\u80fd\u4f53\u73b0\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u7535\u8def\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u673a\u68b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u8868\u5f81\u5047\u8bbe\u3002"}}

While prior work has sought to mitigate these shifts by using self-supervised regularization with paired longitudinal data, such data are often unavailable in practice. To address this, we propose \\emph{DuMeta++}, a dual meta-learning framework that operates without paired longitudinal data. Our approach integrates: (1) meta-feature learning to extract age-agnostic semantic representations of spatiotemporally evolving brain structures, and (2) meta-initialization learning to enable data-efficient adaptation of the segmentation model. Furthermore, we propose a memory-bank-based class-aware regularization strategy to enforce longitudinal consistency without explicit longitudinal supervision. We theoretically prove the convergence of our DuMeta++, ensuring stability. Experiments on diverse datasets (iSeg-2019, IBIS, OASIS, ADNI) under few-shot settings demonstrate that DuMeta++ outperforms existing methods in cross-age generalization.

Srikant"], "title": "Hybrid Feedback-Guided Optimal Learning for Wireless Interactive Panoramic Scene Delivery", "comment": "Submitting to ToN", "summary": "Immersive applications such as virtual and augmented reality impose stringent requirements on frame rate, latency, and synchronization between physical and virtual environments. To meet these requirements, an edge server must render panoramic content, predict user head motion, and transmit a portion of the scene that is large enough to cover the user viewport while remaining within wireless bandwidth constraints. Each portion produces two feedback signals: prediction feedback, indicating whether the selected portion covers the actual viewport, and transmission feedback, indicating whether the corresponding packets are successfully delivered. Prior work models this problem as a multi-armed bandit with two-level bandit feedback, but fails to exploit the fact that prediction feedback can be retrospectively computed for all candidate portions once the user head pose is observed. As a result, prediction feedback constitutes full-information feedback rather than bandit feedback. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a two-level hybrid feedback model that combines full-information and bandit feedback, and formulate the portion selection problem as an online learning task under this setting. We derive an instance-dependent regret lower bound for the hybrid feedback model and propose AdaPort, a hybrid learning algorithm that leverages both feedback types to improve learning efficiency. We further establish an instance-dependent regret upper bound that matches the lower bound asymptotically, and demonstrate through real-world trace driven simulations that AdaPort consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8eVR/AR\u4e2d\u89c6\u53e3\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u4e24\u5c42\u6df7\u5408\u53cd\u9988\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5AdaPort\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u56de\u6eaf\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u53cd\u9988\uff08\u5168\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u4e0e\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f20\u8f93\u53cd\u9988\uff08\u5e26\u81c2\uff09\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u9009\u5757\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\u5339\u914d\u4e14\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c06VR/AR\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u53e3\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5185\u5bb9\u9009\u62e9\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u53cc\u5c42\u5e26\u81c2\u8d4c\u535a\u673a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u53cd\u9988\u53ef\u5728\u7528\u6237\u59ff\u6001\u89c2\u6d4b\u540e\u56de\u6eaf\u8ba1\u7b97\u6240\u6709\u5019\u9009\u5757\u2014\u2014\u5373\u5b9e\u9645\u4e3a\u5168\u4fe1\u606f\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7eaf\u5e26\u81c2\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5efa\u6a21\u5931\u51c6\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u5c42\u6df7\u5408\u53cd\u9988\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u878d\u5408\u5168\u4fe1\u606f\u9884\u6d4b\u53cd\u9988\u4e0e\u5e26\u81c2\u5f0f\u4f20\u8f93\u53cd\u9988\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7b97\u6cd5AdaPort\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u5176\u4e0e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6094\u503c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u6e10\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u3002", "result": "AdaPort\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u8f68\u8ff9\u9a71\u52a8\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8eSOTA\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6094\u503c\u4e0a\u754c\u4e0e\u6240\u5bfc\u51fa\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\u6e10\u8fd1\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u5168\u4fe1\u606f\u7279\u6027\u6784\u5efa\u6df7\u5408\u53cd\u9988\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8fb9\u7f18\u7aefVR/AR\u5185\u5bb9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\uff0cAdaPort\u4e3a\u6b64\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5b8c\u5907\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Although recent works in reinforcement learning have yielded various locomotion strategies, planning over multiple experts remains a complex issue. Existing approaches encounter several constraints: traditional planners are unable to integrate skill-specific policies, whereas hierarchical learning frameworks often lose interpretability and require retraining whenever new policies are added. In this paper, we propose a feasibility-guided planning framework that successfully incorporates multiple terrain-specific policies. Each policy is paired with a Feasibility-Net, which learned to predict feasibility tensors based on the local elevation maps and task vectors. This integration allows classical planning algorithms to derive optimal paths. Through both simulated and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our method efficiently generates reliable plans across diverse and challenging terrains, while consistently aligning with the capabilities of the underlying policies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5730\u5f62\u7279\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\u914d\u5907\u4e00\u4e2aFeasibility-Net\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u5f20\u91cf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6216\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u7b56\u7565\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u7ecf\u5178\u89c4\u5212\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u7075\u6d3b\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u6280\u80fd\u7279\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e14\u4f20\u7edf\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5730\u5f62\u7b56\u7565\u914d\u6709\u4e00\u4e2aFeasibility-Net\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u9ad8\u7a0b\u56fe\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u5411\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u5f20\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5d4c\u5165\u7ecf\u5178\u89c4\u5212\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u591a\u6837\u590d\u6742\u5730\u5f62\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u9760\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u59cb\u7ec8\u4e0e\u5e95\u5c42\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u529b\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u7b56\u7565\u96c6\u6210\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5730\u5f62\u4e0b\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

The 0.5B variant offers the best overall discrimination capability with F1 scores of 0.791 (micro) and 0.785 (macro) on the test set, while the 0.1B variant demonstrates exceptional efficiency.

We first analyze why single-agent architectures fail: context pollution from mixed reasoning traces, silent text input failures undetected by the agent, and repetitive action loops without escape. Minitap addresses each failure through targeted mechanisms: cognitive separation across six specialized agents, deterministic post-validation of text input against device state, and meta-cognitive reasoning that detects cycles and triggers strategy changes. Ablations show multi-agent decomposition contributes +21 points over single-agent baselines; verified execution adds +7 points; meta-cognition adds +9 points.

While many prior approaches mitigate this effect through architectural modifications or residual mechanisms, the underlying spectral cause of oversmoothing is often left implicit. We propose Laplacian-LoRA, a simple and interpretable low-rank spectral adaptation of standard GCNs. Rather than redesigning message passing, Laplacian-LoRA introduces a learnable, spectrally anchored correction to the fixed Laplacian propagation operator, selectively weakening contraction while preserving stability and the low-pass inductive bias. Across multiple benchmark datasets and depths, Laplacian-LoRA consistently delays the onset of oversmoothing, extending the effective depth of GCNs by up to a factor of two. Embedding variance diagnostics confirm that these gains arise from delayed representational collapse, while learned spectral analysis demonstrates that the correction is smooth, bounded, and well behaved. Our results show that oversmoothing is a depth-dependent spectral phenomenon that can be systematically delayed through modest, low-rank adaptation of the graph propagation operator.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLaplacian-LoRA\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4e\u79e9\u8c31\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u4f20\u64ad\u7b97\u5b50\u4e0a\u6dfb\u52a0\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8c31\u951a\u5b9a\u6821\u6b63\u6765\u7f13\u89e3GCN\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8868\u5f81\u574d\u7f29\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u6548\u6df1\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u662f\u6df1\u5c42\u56fe\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GCN\uff09\u7684\u6839\u672c\u6027\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8c31\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u5e38\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u67b6\u6784\u4fee\u6539\u6216\u6b8b\u5dee\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8c31\u673a\u5236\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLaplacian-LoRA\uff1a\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u4f20\u64ad\u7b97\u5b50\u4e0a\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u8c31\u951a\u5b9a\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u4fee\u6b63\u9879\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u524a\u5f31\u8c31\u6536\u7f29\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u4f4e\u901a\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0b\uff0cLaplacian-LoRA\u663e\u8457\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u53d1\u751f\uff0c\u5c06GCN\u6709\u6548\u6df1\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u81f3\u539f\u6709\u4e24\u500d\uff1b\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u5dee\u8bca\u65ad\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5176\u4fee\u6b63\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u6709\u754c\u4e14\u884c\u4e3a\u826f\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u6df1\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8c31\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u4f4e\u79e9\u7684\u56fe\u4f20\u64ad\u7b97\u5b50\u9002\u914d\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5ef6\u7f13\uff1bLaplacian-LoRA\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236GCN\u8c31\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

In particular, assessing control algorithms requires an accurate vehicle dynamics simulation. However, recent publications use models with varying levels of detail. This disparity makes it difficult to compare individual control algorithms. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the influence of the fidelity of vehicle dynamics modeling on the closed-loop behavior of trajectory-following controllers. For this purpose, we introduce a comprehensive Autoware-compatible vehicle model. By simplifying this, we derive models with varying fidelity. Evaluating over 550 simulation runs allows us to quantify each model's approximation quality compared to real-world data. Furthermore, we investigate whether the influence of model simplifications changes with varying margins to the acceleration limit of the vehicle. From this, we deduce to which degree a vehicle model can be simplified to evaluate control algorithms depending on the specific application. The real-world data used to validate the simulation environment originate from the Indy Autonomous Challenge race at the Autodromo Nazionale di Monza in June 2023.

A Comparative Study on the Cross-Lingual Transfer of Composite Harms", "comment": "Accepted at the AICS Workshop, AAAI 2026", "summary": "Most safety evaluations of large language models (LLMs) remain anchored in English. Translation is often used as a shortcut to probe multilingual behavior, but it rarely captures the full picture, especially when harmful intent or structure morphs across languages. Some types of harm survive translation almost intact, while others distort or disappear. To study this effect, we introduce CompositeHarm, a translation-based benchmark designed to examine how safety alignment holds up as both syntax and semantics shift. It combines two complementary English datasets, AttaQ, which targets structured adversarial attacks, and MMSafetyBench, which covers contextual, real-world harms, and extends them into six languages: English, Hindi, Assamese, Marathi, Kannada, and Gujarati. Using three large models, we find that attack success rates rise sharply in Indic languages, especially under adversarial syntax, while contextual harms transfer more moderately. To ensure scalability and energy efficiency, our study adopts lightweight inference strategies inspired by edge-AI design principles, reducing redundant evaluation passes while preserving cross-lingual fidelity. This design makes large-scale multilingual safety testing both computationally feasible and environmentally conscious. Overall, our results show that translated benchmarks are a necessary first step, but not a sufficient one, toward building grounded, resource-aware, language-adaptive safety systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCompositeHarm\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6269\u5c55\u82f1\u6587\u5b89\u5168\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u81f3\u516d\u79cd\u5370\u5ea6\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u63ed\u793aLLM\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u5728\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u6307\u51fa\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8bed\u6cd5\u653b\u51fb\u5728\u5370\u5730\u8bed\u7b49\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u7387\u663e\u8457\u4e0a\u5347\uff1b\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u80fd\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u82f1\u8bed\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u7ffb\u8bd1\u96be\u4ee5\u53cd\u6620\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u95f4\u6709\u5bb3\u610f\u56fe\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u8003\u5bdf\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u5728\u8bed\u6cd5\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaCompositeHarm\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u878d\u5408AttaQ\uff08\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\uff09\u4e0eMMSafetyBench\uff08\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u73b0\u5b9e\u5371\u5bb3\uff09\u4e24\u4e2a\u82f1\u6587\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u82f1\u8bed\u3001\u5370\u5730\u8bed\u3001\u963f\u8428\u59c6\u8bed\u3001\u9a6c\u62c9\u5730\u8bed\u3001\u5361\u7eb3\u8fbe\u8bed\u548c\u53e4\u5409\u62c9\u7279\u8bed\uff1b\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u53d7\u8fb9\u7f18AI\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u5728\u5370\u5730\u8bed\u7b49\u5370\u6b27\u8bed\u7cfb\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u7387\u663e\u8457\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8bed\u6cd5\u4e0b\uff1b\u800c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7c7b\u5371\u5bb3\u8fc1\u79fb\u8f83\u6e29\u548c\uff1b\u8f7b\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u969c\u4e86\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u73af\u4fdd\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ffb\u8bd1\u57fa\u51c6\u662f\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u8d77\u70b9\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u652f\u6491\u771f\u6b63\u624e\u6839\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\u6784\u5efa\u3002"}}

Unlike prior works that focus primarily on coarse accident identification, RoadSafe365 is independently curated and systematically organized using a hierarchical taxonomy that refines and extends foundational definitions of crash, incident, and violation to bridge official traffic safety standards with data-driven traffic understanding systems. RoadSafe365 provides rich attribute annotations across diverse traffic event types, environmental contexts, and interaction scenarios, yielding 36,196 annotated clips from both dashcam and surveillance cameras. Each clip is paired with multiple-choice question-answer sets, comprising 864K candidate options, 8.4K unique answers, and 36K detailed scene descriptions collectively designed for vision-language understanding and reasoning. We establish strong baselines and observe consistent gains when fine-tuning on RoadSafe365. Cross-domain experiments on both real and synthetic datasets further validate its effectiveness.

We introduce VertCoHiRF, a fully decentralized framework for vertical federated clustering based on structural consensus across heterogeneous views, allowing each agent to apply a base clustering method adapted to its local feature space in a peer-to-peer manner. Rather than exchanging feature-dependent statistics or relying on noise injection for privacy, agents cluster their local views independently and reconcile their proposals through identifier-level consensus. Consensus is achieved via decentralized ordinal ranking to select representative medoids, progressively inducing a shared hierarchical clustering across agents. Communication is limited to sample identifiers, cluster labels, and ordinal rankings, providing privacy by design while supporting overlapping feature partitions and heterogeneous local clustering methods, and yielding an interpretable shared Cluster Fusion Hierarchy (CFH) that captures cross-view agreement at multiple resolutions.We analyze communication complexity and robustness, and experiments demonstrate competitive clustering performance in vertical federated settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86VertCoHiRF\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5b8c\u5168\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7684\u5782\u76f4\u8054\u90a6\u805a\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f02\u6784\u89c6\u56fe\u95f4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6570\u636e\u7684\u534f\u540c\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4ea4\u6362\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u5173\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6837\u672c\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u3001\u805a\u7c7b\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u5e8f\u6570\u6392\u5e8f\u8fdb\u884c\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u4fdd\u969c\u9690\u79c1\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5f02\u6784\u672c\u5730\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5782\u76f4\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fk-means\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e2d\u5fc3\u534f\u8c03\u6216\u4ea4\u6362\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u503c\u7edf\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u89c6\u56fe\u6216\u5bf9\u6297\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5dee\u3002", "method": "VertCoHiRF\u91c7\u7528\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5404\u4ee3\u7406\u57fa\u4e8e\u672c\u5730\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u72ec\u7acb\u8fd0\u884c\u9002\u914d\u7684\u57fa\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u5c42\u7ea7\u7684\u5171\u8bc6\u673a\u5236\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u5e8f\u6570\u6392\u5e8f\u9009\u62e9\u4ee3\u8868\u6027medoid\uff09\u9010\u6b65\u6784\u5efa\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u805a\u7c7b\u7ed3\u6784\uff08CFH\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u9700\u4f20\u8f93\u6837\u672c\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u3001\u805a\u7c7b\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u5e8f\u6570\u6392\u540d\uff0c\u5929\u7136\u6ee1\u8db3\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\uff1b\u652f\u6301\u91cd\u53e0\u7279\u5f81\u5212\u5206\u4e0e\u5f02\u6784\u672c\u5730\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684Cluster Fusion Hierarchy\uff08CFH\uff09\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u5782\u76f4\u8054\u90a6\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "VertCoHiRF\u4e3a\u5782\u76f4\u8054\u90a6\u805a\u7c7b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u53cb\u597d\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e2d\u5fc3\u534f\u8c03\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u7edf\u8ba1\u4ea4\u6362\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002"}}

Such interlacing cables create hitches by winding two or more cables around each other, which can enclose payloads or can further develop into knots. Dynamic modeling and control of such hitches is key to mastering the inter-cable manipulation in context of cable-suspended aerial manipulation. This paper introduces an ellipsoid-based kinematic model to connect the geometric nature of a hitch created by two cables and the dynamics of the hitch driven by four aerial vehicles, which reveals the control-affine form of the system. As the constraint for maintaining tension of a cable is also control-affine, we design a quadratic programming-based controller that combines Control Lyapunov and High-Order Control Barrier Functions (CLF-HOCBF-QP) to precisely track a desired hitch position and system shape while enforcing safety constraints like cable tautness. We convert desired geometric reference configurations into target robot positions and introduce a composite error into the Lyapunov function to ensure a relative degree of one to the input.

However, the development of robust diagnostic models remains impeded by acute clinical data scarcity and a lack of interpretable reasoning. Current solutions frequently struggle with cross-lingual generalization and fail to provide the transparent rationales essential for clinical trust. To address these barriers, we introduce SynCog, a novel framework integrating controllable zero-shot multimodal data synthesis with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) deduction fine-tuning. Specifically, SynCog simulates diverse virtual subjects with varying cognitive profiles to effectively alleviate clinical data scarcity. This generative paradigm enables the rapid, zero-shot expansion of clinical corpora across diverse languages, effectively bypassing data bottlenecks in low-resource settings and bolstering the diagnostic performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Leveraging this synthesized dataset, we fine-tune a foundational multimodal backbone using a CoT deduction strategy, empowering the model to explicitly articulate diagnostic thought processes rather than relying on black-box predictions. Extensive experiments on the ADReSS and ADReSSo benchmarks demonstrate that augmenting limited clinical data with synthetic phenotypes yields competitive diagnostic performance, achieving Macro-F1 scores of 80.67% and 78.46%, respectively, outperforming current baseline models. Furthermore, evaluation on an independent real-world Mandarin cohort (CIR-E) demonstrates robust cross-linguistic generalization, attaining a Macro-F1 of 48.71%.

However, these SR models introduce a previously unexplored attack surface into imaging pipelines. In this paper, we present AdvSR, a framework demonstrating that adversarial behavior can be embedded directly into SR model weights during training, requiring no access to inputs at inference time. Unlike prior attacks that perturb inputs or rely on backdoor triggers, AdvSR operates entirely at the model level. By jointly optimizing for reconstruction quality and targeted adversarial outcomes, AdvSR produces models that appear benign under standard image quality metrics while inducing downstream misclassification. We evaluate AdvSR on three SR architectures (SRCNN, EDSR, SwinIR) paired with a YOLOv11 classifier and demonstrate that AdvSR models can achieve high attack success rates with minimal quality degradation. These findings highlight a new model-level threat for imaging pipelines, with implications for how practitioners source and validate models in safety-critical applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAdvSR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff08SR\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u5bf9\u6297\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u7ea7\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8f93\u5165\u8bbf\u95ee\u5373\u53ef\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\uff09\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u6b63\u5e38\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6210\u50cf\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u7684\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6a21\u578b\u672c\u8eab\u53ef\u80fd\u6784\u6210\u65b0\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u9762\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u653b\u51fb\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u8f93\u5165\u6270\u52a8\u6216\u540e\u95e8\u89e6\u53d1\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u5bf9\u6297\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAdvSR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728SR\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982YOLOv11\u5206\u7c7b\uff09\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5c06\u5bf9\u6297\u884c\u4e3a\u5185\u5d4c\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u4e2d\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u5b8c\u5168\u53d1\u751f\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5c42\u9762\u3002", "result": "\u5728SRCNN\u3001EDSR\u3001SwinIR\u4e09\u79cdSR\u6a21\u578b\u4e0eYOLOv11\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cAdvSR\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\uff08\u5982PSNR\u3001SSIM\uff09\u4e0b\u964d\u6781\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6210\u50cf\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u4e2d\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u7ea7\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u8b66\u793a\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u6e90\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9700\u8003\u8651\u6b64\u7c7b\u9690\u853d\u5bf9\u6297\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), especially their reasoning abilities unlocked through reinforcement learning (RL), have opened new opportunities for tackling tasks with long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, leveraging LLM reasoning for time series remains in its infancy, hindered by the absence of carefully curated time series CoT data for training, limited data efficiency caused by underexplored data scheduling, and the lack of RL algorithms tailored for exploiting such time series CoT data. In this paper, we introduce VeriTime, a framework that tailors LLMs for time series reasoning through data synthesis, data scheduling, and RL training. First, we propose a data synthesis pipeline that constructs a TS-text multimodal dataset with process-verifiable annotations. Second, we design a data scheduling mechanism that arranges training samples according to a principled hierarchy of difficulty and task taxonomy. Third, we develop a two-stage reinforcement finetuning featuring fine-grained, multi-objective rewards that leverage verifiable process-level CoT data. Extensive experiments show that VeriTime substantially boosts LLM performance across diverse time series reasoning tasks. Notably, it enables compact 3B, 4B models to achieve reasoning capabilities on par with or exceeding those of larger proprietary LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "VeriTime\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u7406\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217-\u6587\u672c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u96be\u5ea6\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8c03\u5ea6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21LLM\uff08\u59823B/4B\uff09\u5728\u5404\u7c7b\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\uff08CoT\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3001\u6570\u636e\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9002\u914d\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217CoT\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVeriTime\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\uff1a1\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u5177\u6709\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6807\u6ce8\u7684TS-text\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1b2\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u96be\u5ea6\u5c42\u7ea7\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8c03\u5ea6\u673a\u5236\uff1b3\uff09\u5f00\u53d1\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5f3a\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7ea7CoT\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eVeriTime\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u4f7f\u7d27\u51d1\u578b3B\u30014B\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u5230\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4e13\u6709LLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "VeriTime\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u6548\u8fc1\u79fb\u81f3\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4e3a\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u9ad8\u6548\u8d4b\u80fd\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

While thresholding scores is Bayes-optimal in the unconstrained setting, using a single threshold generally violates statistical group fairness constraints. Under independence (statistical parity) and separation (equalized odds), such thresholding suffices when the scores already satisfy the corresponding criterion. However, this does not extend to sufficiency: even perfectly group-calibrated scores -- including true class probabilities -- violate predictive parity after thresholding. In this work, we present an exact solution for optimal binary (randomized) classification under sufficiency, assuming finite sets of group-calibrated scores. We provide a geometric characterization of the feasible pairs of positive predictive value (PPV) and false omission rate (FOR) achievable by such classifiers, and use it to derive a simple post-processing algorithm that attains the optimal classifier using only group-calibrated scores and group membership. Finally, since sufficiency and separation are generally incompatible, we identify the classifier that minimizes deviation from separation subject to sufficiency, and show that it can also be obtained by our algorithm, often achieving performance comparable to the optimum.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u5145\u5206\u6027\uff08sufficiency\uff09\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7fa4\u4f53\u6821\u51c6\u5206\u6570\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u540e\u5904\u7406\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u6b63\u9884\u6d4b\u503c\uff08PPV\uff09\u4e0e\u5047\u9057\u6f0f\u7387\uff08FOR\uff09\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u5145\u5206\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5bf9\u5206\u79bb\u6027\uff08separation\uff09\u7684\u504f\u79bb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u9608\u503c\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u5728\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5f80\u5f80\u5931\u6548\uff1b\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5145\u5206\u6027\uff08\u5982\u9884\u6d4b\u5947\u5076\u6027\uff09\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u4f7f\u7528\u5b8c\u7f8e\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u5206\u6570\uff08\u5982\u771f\u5b9e\u6982\u7387\uff09\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u9608\u503c\u6cd5\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6ee1\u8db3\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u96c6\u4e0a\u7fa4\u4f53\u6821\u51c6\u5206\u6570\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u523b\u753b\u53ef\u884cPPV-FOR\u5bf9\u7684\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5206\u6570\u548c\u7ec4\u522b\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u968f\u673a\u5316\u540e\u5904\u7406\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6784\u5efa\u517c\u987e\u5145\u5206\u6027\u4e0e\u5206\u79bb\u6027\u7684\u6298\u4e2d\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u5145\u5206\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u6700\u4f18\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\uff1b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86PPV\u4e0eFOR\u53ef\u884c\u57df\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u5f81\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u540e\u5904\u7406\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u5206\u79bb\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u7406\u8bba\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5145\u5206\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0d\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u9608\u503c\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u6240\u63d0\u51e0\u4f55\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u540e\u5904\u7406\u7b97\u6cd5\u7cbe\u786e\u8fbe\u6210\uff1b\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u4e86\u5145\u5206\u6027\u53ca\u4e0e\u5206\u79bb\u6027\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u516c\u5e73\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

These templates can force policies to process irrelevant information that distracts from critical action-prediction signals. This creates a bottleneck: without successful policies, we cannot verify reasoning quality; without quality reasoning, we cannot build robust policies. We introduce R&B-EnCoRe, which enables models to bootstrap embodied reasoning from internet-scale knowledge through self-supervised refinement. By treating reasoning as a latent variable within importance-weighted variational inference, models can generate and distill a refined reasoning training dataset of embodiment-specific strategies without external rewards, verifiers, or human annotation. We validate R&B-EnCoRe across manipulation (Franka Panda in simulation, WidowX in hardware), legged navigation (bipedal, wheeled, bicycle, quadruped), and autonomous driving embodiments using various VLA architectures with 1B, 4B, 7B, and 30B parameters. Our approach achieves 28% gains in manipulation success, 101% improvement in navigation scores, and 21% reduction in collision-rate metric over models that indiscriminately reason about all available primitives.

A faithful judge should base its verdicts solely on content quality, remain invariant to irrelevant context, and transparently reflect the factors driving its decisions. We test this ideal via controlled cue perturbations-synthetic metadata labels injected into evaluation prompts-for six judge models: GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0-Flash, Gemma-3-27B, Qwen3-235B, Claude-3-Haiku, and Llama3-70B. Experiments span two complementary datasets with distinct evaluation regimes: ELI5 (factual QA) and LitBench (open-ended creative writing). We study six cue families: source, temporal, age, gender, ethnicity, and educational status. Beyond measuring verdict shift rates (VSR), we introduce cue acknowledgment rate (CAR) to quantify whether judges explicitly reference the injected cues in their natural-language rationales. Across cues with strong behavioral effects-e.g., provenance hierarchies (Expert > Human > LLM > Unknown), recency preferences (New > Old), and educational-status favoritism-CAR is typically at or near zero, indicating that shortcut reliance is largely unreported even when it drives decisions. Crucially, CAR is also dataset-dependent: explicit cue recognition is more likely to surface in the factual ELI5 setting for some models and cues, but often collapses in the open-ended LitBench regime, where large verdict shifts can persist despite zero acknowledgment. The combination of substantial verdict sensitivity and limited cue acknowledgment reveals an explanation gap in LLM-as-judge pipelines, raising concerns about reliability of model-based evaluation in both research and deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u65f6\u5bf9\u65e0\u5173\u63d0\u793a\u7ebf\u7d22\uff08\u5982\u6765\u6e90\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u6027\u522b\u7b49\u5143\u6570\u636e\uff09\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5224\u51b3\u6613\u53d7\u5e72\u6270\u4e14\u6781\u5c11\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u663e\u5f0f\u627f\u8ba4\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u51fa\u2018\u89e3\u91ca\u9e3f\u6c9f\u2019\uff0c\u5a01\u80c1\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7528\u4f5c\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u57fa\u4e8e\u5185\u5bb9\u8d28\u91cf\u516c\u6b63\u8bc4\u5224\u3001\u662f\u5426\u5bf9\u65e0\u5173\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0d\u53d8\u3001\u662f\u5426\u900f\u660e\u53cd\u6620\u51b3\u7b56\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5c1a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u68c0\u9a8c\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5411\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u516d\u7c7b\u5408\u6210\u5143\u6570\u636e\u7ebf\u7d22\uff08\u6765\u6e90\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u5e74\u9f84\u3001\u6027\u522b\u3001\u65cf\u88d4\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u5728ELI5\uff08\u4e8b\u5b9e\u95ee\u7b54\uff09\u548cLitBench\uff08\u521b\u610f\u5199\u4f5c\uff09\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u516d\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41LLM\u88c1\u5224\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u2018\u5224\u51b3\u504f\u79fb\u7387\uff08VSR\uff09\u2019\u548c\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u2018\u7ebf\u7d22\u627f\u8ba4\u7387\uff08CAR\uff09\u2019\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0e\u89e3\u91ca\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u6570\u5f3a\u6548\u5e94\u7ebf\u7d22\uff08\u5982\u2018\u4e13\u5bb6>\u4eba\u7c7b>LLM\u2019\u6765\u6e90\u5c42\u7ea7\u3001\u2018\u65b0>\u65e7\u2019\u65f6\u95f4\u504f\u597d\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u7a0b\u5ea6\u504f\u5411\uff09\u5f15\u53d1\u663e\u8457\u5224\u51b3\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u4f46CAR\u666e\u904d\u63a5\u8fd1\u96f6\uff1bCAR\u5177\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u2014\u2014\u5728ELI5\u4e2d\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u5076\u6709\u627f\u8ba4\uff0c\u5728LitBench\u4e2d\u51e0\u4e4e\u5b8c\u5168\u6d88\u5931\uff0c\u800c\u5224\u51b3\u504f\u79fb\u4ecd\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u88c1\u5224\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u2018\u89e3\u91ca\u9e3f\u6c9f\u2019\uff1a\u51b3\u7b56\u6613\u53d7\u9690\u542b\u7ebf\u7d22\u64cd\u7eb5\uff0c\u5374\u6781\u5c11\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u66b4\u9732\u8be5\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e25\u91cd\u524a\u5f31\u5176\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

While test-time adaptation (TTA) can counteract such shifts, existing methods are too resource-intensive for on-device deployment. To address this challenge, we propose LQA, a lightweight, quantized-adaptive framework for VLMs that combines a modality-aware quantization strategy with gradient-free test-time adaptation. We introduce Selective Hybrid Quantization (SHQ) and a quantized, gradient-free adaptation mechanism to enable robust and efficient VLM deployment on resource-constrained hardware. Experiments across both synthetic and real-world distribution shifts show that LQA improves overall adaptation performance by 4.5\\%, uses less memory than full-precision models, and significantly outperforms gradient-based TTA methods, achieving up to 19.9$\\times$ lower memory usage across seven open-source datasets.

A closely related but distinct problem is training models that are robust to internal perturbations to their weights, which may be an important need for future low-power hardware platforms. In this paper, we explore the usage of two methods, sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) and random-weight perturbation (RWP), to find minima robust to a variety of random corruptions to weights. We consider the problem from two angles: generalization (how do we reduce the noise-robust generalization gap) and optimization (how do we maximize performance from optimizers when subject to strong perturbations). First, we establish, both theoretically and empirically, that an over-regularized RWP training objective is optimal for noise-robust generalization. For small-magnitude noise, we find that SAM's adversarial objective further improves performance over any RWP configuration, but performs poorly for large-magnitude noise. We link the cause of this to a vanishing-gradient effect, caused by unevenness in the loss landscape, affecting both SAM and RWP. Lastly, we demonstrate that dynamically adjusting the perturbation strength to match the evolution of the loss landscape improves optimizing for these perturbed objectives.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6743\u91cd\u6270\u52a8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86SAM\u548cRWP\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u566a\u58f0\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6270\u52a8\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5185\u90e8\u6743\u91cd\u6270\u52a8\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u786c\u4ef6\u5e73\u53f0\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u7406\u89e3\u5e73\u5766\u6781\u5c0f\u503c\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5c16\u9510\u611f\u77e5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\uff08SAM\uff09\u548c\u968f\u673a\u6743\u91cd\u6270\u52a8\uff08RWP\uff09\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0a\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5e45\u5ea6\u6743\u91cd\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u6270\u52a8\u5f3a\u5ea6\u8c03\u6574\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u8fc7\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684RWP\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0a\u6700\u4f18\uff1bSAM\u5728\u5c0f\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8eRWP\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5927\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u56e0\u635f\u5931\u66f2\u9762\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u5bfc\u81f4\u68af\u5ea6\u6d88\u5931\u800c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6270\u52a8\u5f3a\u5ea6\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9700\u517c\u987e\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u6270\u52a8\u5f3a\u5ea6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff0cRWP\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u5f3a\u566a\u58f0\u573a\u666f\uff0cSAM\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5f31\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u4e8c\u8005\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u6e90\u4e8e\u635f\u5931\u66f2\u9762\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\u3002"}}

Automat. Lett. (RA-L) 2026", "summary": "Online change detection is crucial for mobile robots to efficiently navigate through dynamic environments. Detecting changes in transient settings, such as active construction sites or frequently reconfigured indoor spaces, is particularly challenging due to frequent occlusions and spatiotemporal variations. Existing approaches often struggle to detect changes and fail to update the map across different observations. To address these limitations, we propose a dual-head network designed for online change detection and long-term map maintenance. A key difficulty in this task is the collection and alignment of real-world data, as manually registering structural differences over time is both labor-intensive and often impractical. To overcome this, we develop a data augmentation strategy that synthesizes structural changes by importing elements from different scenes, enabling effective model training without the need for extensive ground-truth annotations. Experiments conducted at real-world construction sites and in indoor office environments demonstrate that our approach generalizes well across diverse scenarios, achieving efficient and accurate map updates.\\resubmit{Our source code and additional material are available at: https://chamelion-pages.github.io/.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u5934\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u957f\u671f\u5730\u56fe\u7ef4\u62a4\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u7f13\u89e3\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u77ac\u6001\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\uff08\u5982\u65bd\u5de5\u573a\u5730\u3001\u9891\u7e41\u91cd\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u5ba4\u5185\u7a7a\u95f4\uff09\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u53d8\u5316\u5e76\u66f4\u65b0\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u4e14\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u91c7\u96c6\u4e0e\u5bf9\u9f50\u56f0\u96be\u3001\u8017\u65f6\u8017\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53cc\u5934\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5904\u7406\u5728\u7ebf\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u957f\u671f\u5730\u56fe\u7ef4\u62a4\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8de8\u573a\u666f\u5143\u7d20\u5bfc\u5165\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u5408\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u65bd\u5de5\u573a\u5730\u548c\u5ba4\u5185\u529e\u516c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u8de8\u573a\u666f\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5730\u56fe\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5728\u7ebf\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5730\u56fe\u6301\u7eed\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing compression and eviction methods often struggle to balance accuracy, compression ratio, and hardware efficiency. We propose DeltaKV, a residual-based KV cache compression framework motivated by two empirical findings: long-range inter-token similarity and highly shared latent components in KV representations. Instead of discarding tokens, DeltaKV encodes semantic residuals relative to retrieved historical references, preserving fidelity while substantially reducing storage. To translate compression gains into real system speedups, we further introduce Sparse-vLLM, a high-performance inference engine with decoupled memory management and kernels optimized for sparse and irregular KV layouts. Experiments show that DeltaKV reduces KV cache memory to 29\\% of the original while maintaining near-lossless accuracy on LongBench, SCBench, and AIME. When integrated with Sparse-vLLM, it achieves up to 2$\\times$ throughput improvement over vLLM in long-context scenarios, demonstrating a practical path toward scalable long-context LLM deployment.

Concerningly, a pre-registered survey of experts failed to predict this result, highlighting our poor understanding of the inductive biases governing learning and generalisation in LLMs. We use emergent misalignment (EM) as a case study to investigate these inductive biases and find that models can just learn the narrow dataset task, but that the general solution appears to be more stable and more efficient. To establish this, we build on the result that different EM finetunes converge to the same linear representation of general misalignment, which can be used to mediate misaligned behaviour. We find a linear representation of the narrow solution also exists, and can be learned by introducing a KL divergence loss. Comparing these representations reveals that general misalignment achieves lower loss, is more robust to perturbations, and is more influential in the pre-training distribution. This work isolates a concrete representation of general misalignment for monitoring and mitigation.

Most existing robust alignment methods focus on uncertainty in alignment data, while overlooking optimization-induced fragility in preference-based objectives. In this work, we revisit robustness for LLM safety alignment from an optimization geometry perspective, and argue that robustness failures cannot be addressed by data-centric methods alone. We propose ShaPO, a geometry-aware preference optimization framework that enforces worst-case alignment objectives via selective geometry control over alignment-critical parameter subspace. By avoiding uniform geometry constraints, ShaPO mitigates the over-regularization that can harm robustness under distribution shift.

Across diverse safety benchmarks and noisy preference settings, ShaPO consistently improves safety robustness over popular preference optimization methods.

However, iterative denoising leads to substantial inference latency, limiting control frequency in real-time closed-loop systems. Existing acceleration methods either reduce sampling steps, bypass diffusion through direct prediction, or reuse past actions, but often struggle to jointly preserve action quality and achieve consistently low latency. In this work, we propose STEP, a lightweight spatiotemporal consistency prediction mechanism to construct high-quality warm-start actions that are both distributionally close to the target action and temporally consistent, without compromising the generative capability of the original diffusion policy. Then, we propose a velocity-aware perturbation injection mechanism that adaptively modulates actuation excitation based on temporal action variation to prevent execution stall especially for real-world tasks. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that the proposed prediction induces a locally contractive mapping, ensuring convergence of action errors during diffusion refinement. We conduct extensive evaluations on nine simulated benchmarks and two real-world tasks. Notably, STEP with 2 steps can achieve an average 21.6% and 27.5% higher success rate than BRIDGER and DDIM on the RoboMimic benchmark and real-world tasks, respectively. These results demonstrate that STEP consistently advances the Pareto frontier of inference latency and success rate over existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSTEP\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u6270\u52a8\u6ce8\u5165\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u52a8\u4f5c\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u8fed\u4ee3\u53bb\u566a\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u95ed\u73af\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u9891\u7387\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u52a8\u4f5c\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSTEP\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u70ed\u542f\u52a8\u52a8\u4f5c\uff1b2\uff09\u901f\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u6270\u52a8\u6ce8\u5165\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u8282\u6267\u884c\u6fc0\u52b1\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u6267\u884c\u505c\u6ede\uff1b3\uff09\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u9884\u6d4b\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5c40\u90e8\u6536\u7f29\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6269\u6563\u7cbe\u70bc\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bef\u5dee\u6536\u655b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e5d\u4e2a\u4eff\u771f\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cSTEP\u4ec5\u75282\u6b65\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5728RoboMimic\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5206\u522b\u6bd4BRIDGER\u548cDDIM\u5e73\u5747\u9ad8\u51fa21.6%\u548c27.5%\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "STEP\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0e\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684Pareto\u524d\u6cbf\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u3002"}}

However, their efficacy is fundamentally constrained by static configurations governing agent behaviors, which are fixed prior to execution and fail to adapt to evolving task dynamics. Existing approaches, relying on manual orchestration or heuristic-based patches, often struggle with poor generalization and fragmented optimization. To transcend these limitations, we propose ToolSelf, a novel paradigm enabling tool-driven runtime self-reconfiguration. By abstracting configuration updates as a callable tool, ToolSelf unifies task execution and self-adjustment into a single action space, achieving a phase transition from external rules to intrinsic parameters. Agents can thereby autonomously update their sub-goals and context based on task progression, and correspondingly adapt their strategy and toolbox, transforming from passive executors into dual managers of both task and self.

In such a system, we present a unified framework to address the general manipulation task problem. Specifically, the proposed method consists of two phases: i) In the first phase for pretraining, the policy is created in a behavior cloning (BC) manner, through leveraging the learning data from our AR-based remote human-robot interaction system; ii) In the second phase, a contrastive learning empowered reinforcement learning (RL) method is developed to obtain more efficient and robust policy than the BC, and thus a projection head is designed to accelerate the learning progress. An event-driven augmented reward is adopted for enhancing the safety. To validate the proposed method, both the physics simulations via PyBullet and real-world experiments are carried out. The results demonstrate that compared to the classic proximal policy optimization and soft actor-critic policies, our method not only significantly speeds up the inference, but also achieves much better performance in terms of the success rate for fulfilling the manipulation tasks. By conducting the ablation study, it is confirmed that the proposed RL with contrastive learning overcomes policy collapse.

Most prior AM demonstrations rely on external motion capture (MoCap) and emphasize position control for coarse interactions, limiting deployability. We present a fully onboard perception-control pipeline for contact-rich AM that achieves accurate motion tracking and regulated contact wrenches without MoCap. The main components are (1) an augmented visual-inertial odometry (VIO) estimator with contact-consistency factors that activate only during interaction, tightening uncertainty around the contact frame and reducing drift, and (2) image-based visual servoing (IBVS) to mitigate perception-control coupling, together with a hybrid force-motion controller that regulates contact wrenches and lateral motion for stable contact. Experiments show that our approach closes the perception-to-wrench loop using only onboard sensing, yielding an velocity estimation improvement of 66.01% at contact, reliable target approach, and stable force holding-pointing toward deployable, in-the-wild aerial manipulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b8c\u5168\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u8f7d\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u611f\u77e5-\u63a7\u5236\u4e00\u4f53\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u52a8\u6355\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u578b\u7a7a\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5c\uff08AM\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u60ef\u6027\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\uff08VIO\uff09\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u89c6\u89c9\u4f3a\u670d\uff08IBVS\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u6df7\u5408\u529b/\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u63a5\u89e6\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u901f\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u63a5\u89e6\u529b\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7a7a\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5c\u5927\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u6355\u6349\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e14\u4fa7\u91cd\u4f4d\u7f6e\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u91ce\u5916\u90e8\u7f72\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u8bbe\u5907\u3001\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u8fd0\u52a8\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e0e\u63a5\u89e6\u529b\u8c03\u63a7\u7684\u5168\u673a\u8f7d\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u60ef\u6027\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\uff08\u542b\u63a5\u89e6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u56e0\u5b50\uff09\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u89c6\u89c9\u4f3a\u670d\uff08IBVS\uff09\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6df7\u5408\u529b-\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u8026\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u8c03\u8282\u63a5\u89e6\u529b\u548c\u6a2a\u5411\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u7528\u673a\u8f7d\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5373\u53ef\u95ed\u73af\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u611f\u77e5\u5230\u63a5\u89e6\u529b\u7684\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u63a5\u89e6\u9636\u6bb5\u901f\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u534766.01%\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u53ef\u9760\u76ee\u6807\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u529b\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u5168\u673a\u8f7d\u611f\u77e5-\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7a7a\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u91ce\u5916\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u578bAM\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Metric-based methods, which extract statistically distinguishable features of MGTs, are often more practical than complex model-based methods that are prone to overfitting. Given their diverse designs, we first place representative metric-based methods within a unified framework, enabling a clear assessment of their advantages and limitations. Our analysis identifies a core challenge across these methods: the token-level detection score is easily biased by the inherent randomness of the MGTs generation process. To address this, we theoretically and empirically reveal two relationships of context detection scores that may aid calibration: Neighbor Similarity and Initial Instability. We then propose a Markov-informed score calibration strategy that models these relationships using Markov random fields, and implements it as a lightweight component via a mean-field approximation, allowing our method to be seamlessly integrated into existing detectors. Extensive experiments in various real-world scenarios, such as cross-LLM and paraphrasing attacks, demonstrate significant gains over baselines with negligible computational overhead.

We introduce Cross-View World Models (XVWM), trained with a cross-view prediction objective: given a sequence of frames from one viewpoint, predict the future state from the same or a different viewpoint after an action is taken. Enforcing cross-view consistency acts as geometric regularization: because the input and output views may share little or no visual overlap, to predict across viewpoints, the model must learn view-invariant representations of the environment's 3D structure. We train on synchronized multi-view gameplay data from Aimlabs, an aim-training platform providing precisely aligned multi-camera recordings with high-frequency action labels. The resulting model gives agents parallel imagination streams across viewpoints, enabling planning in whichever frame of reference best suits the task while executing from the egocentric view. Our results show that multi-view consistency provides a strong learning signal for spatially grounded representations. Finally, predicting the consequences of one's actions from another viewpoint may offer a foundation for perspective-taking in multi-agent settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff08XVWM\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u5373\u4ece\u4e00\u4e2a\u89c6\u89d2\u8f93\u5165\u5e27\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u540c\u4e00\u6216\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u7684\u672a\u6765\u72b6\u6001\uff09\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u76843D\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u53d8\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\uff08\u5982\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff09\u89c6\u89d2\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u5bfc\u822a\uff09\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u800c\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4fe1\u606f\u53ef\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCross-View World Models\uff08XVWM\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u540c\u6b65\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6e38\u620f\u6570\u636e\uff08Aimlabs\u5e73\u53f0\uff09\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u2014\u2014\u7ed9\u5b9a\u67d0\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u5e27\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u53e6\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\uff08\u76f8\u540c\u6216\u4e0d\u540c\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u672a\u6765\u72b6\u6001\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u51e0\u4f55\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u8feb\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u89c6\u89d2\u65e0\u5173\u76843D\u7ed3\u6784\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "result": "XVWM\u6210\u529f\u652f\u6301\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u5e76\u884c\u2018\u60f3\u8c61\u2019\u672a\u6765\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6309\u9700\u5207\u6362\u53c2\u8003\u7cfb\u8fdb\u884c\u89c4\u5212\uff08\u6267\u884c\u4ecd\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u89d2\uff09\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u662f\u5b66\u4e60\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a5\u5730\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u5f3a\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5e76\u521d\u6b65\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u652f\u6301\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u89c6\u89d2\u91c7\u62e9\uff08perspective-taking\uff09\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u5177\u5907\u51e0\u4f55\u610f\u8bc6\u548c\u4ed6\u4eba\u89c6\u89d2\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, existing steering-based alignment methods suffer from limited controllability: steering a target value often unintentionally activates other, non-target values. To characterize this limitation, we introduce value leakage, a diagnostic notion that captures the unintended activation of non-target values during value steering, along with a normalized leakage metric grounded in Schwartz's value theory. In light of this analysis, we propose NeVA, a neuron-level editing framework for controllable value alignment in LLMs. NeVA identifies sparse, value-relevant neurons and performs inference-time activation editing, enabling fine-grained control without parameter updates or retraining.

In this context, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers a distinct advantage, as it can explicitly guide the selection of subsequent viewpoints and then refine the representation with new observations. However, existing approaches rely solely on geometric cues, neglect manipulation-relevant semantics, and tend to prioritize exploitation over exploration. To tackle these limitations, we introduce an instance-aware Next Best View (NBV) policy that prioritizes underexplored regions by leveraging object features. Specifically, our object-aware 3DGS distills instancelevel information into one-hot object vectors, which are used to compute confidence-weighted information gain that guides the identification of regions associated with erroneous and uncertain Gaussians. Furthermore, our method can be easily adapted to an object-centric NBV, which focuses view selection on a target object, thereby improving reconstruction robustness to object placement. Experiments demonstrate that our NBV policy reduces depth error by up to 77.14% on the synthetic dataset and 34.10% on the real-world GraspNet dataset compared to baselines. Moreover, compared to targeting the entire scene, performing NBV on a specific object yields an additional reduction of 25.60% in depth error for that object.

Prior detectors developed for auto-regressive LLMs typically rely on single-pass cues and do not directly transfer to diffusion generation, where factuality evidence is distributed across the denoising trajectory and may appear, drift, or be self-corrected over time. We introduce TDGNet, a temporal dynamic graph framework that formulates hallucination detection as learning over evolving token-level attention graphs. At each denoising step, we sparsify the attention graph and update per-token memories via message passing, then apply temporal attention to aggregate trajectory-wide evidence for final prediction. Experiments on LLaDA-8B and Dream-7B across QA benchmarks show consistent AUROC improvements over output-based, latent-based, and static-graph baselines, with single-pass inference and modest overhead.

That means most of the existing MPNNs fail to be so `deep'. Although some previous work tended to handle this challenge via optimization- or structure-level remedies, the overall performance of GCNs still suffers from limited accuracy, poor stability, and unaffordable computational cost. Moreover, neglect of higher-order relationships during the propagation of MPNNs has further limited the performance of them. To overcome these challenges, a novel variant of PageRank named motif-based personalized PageRank (MPPR) is proposed to measure the influence of one node to another on the basis of considering higher-order motif relationships. Secondly, the MPPR is utilized to the message passing process of GCNs, thereby guiding the message passing process at a relatively `high' level. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms almost all of the baselines on accuracy, stability, and time consumption. Additionally, the proposed method can be considered as a component that can underpin almost all GCN tasks, with DGCRL being demonstrated in the experiment.

Under a Spectral Dominance condition, we show certified unlearnability is feasible when the poison spectrum overwhelms the clean semantic spectrum. Guided by this, we propose Unlearnable Tabular Data via DecOuPled Shortcut EmbeddIng (UTOPIA), which exploits feature redundancy to decouple optimization into two channels: high saliency features for semantic obfuscation and low saliency redundant features for embedding a hyper correlated shortcut, yielding constraint-aware dominant shortcuts while preserving tabular validity.

A major barrier is embodiment variability: different dexterous hands exhibit distinct kinematics and dynamics, forcing prior methods to train separate policies or rely on shared action spaces with per-embodiment decoder heads. We present DexFormer, an end-to-end, dynamics-aware cross-embodiment policy built on a modified transformer backbone that conditions on historical observations. By using temporal context to infer morphology and dynamics on the fly, DexFormer adapts to diverse hand configurations and produces embodiment-appropriate control actions. Trained over a variety of procedurally generated dexterous-hand assets, DexFormer acquires a generalizable manipulation prior and exhibits strong zero-shot transfer to Leap Hand, Allegro Hand, and Rapid Hand. Our results show that a single policy can generalize across heterogeneous hand embodiments, establishing a scalable foundation for cross-embodiment dexterous manipulation.

Standard reasoning LLMs verbalize intermediate steps as chain-of-thought; latent reasoning transformers (LRTs) instead perform deliberation entirely in continuous hidden space. We investigate an LRT, decoding the model's evolving beliefs at every step on a multiple-choice QA benchmark. We find that the model spontaneously learns a structured search process in latent space. Deliberation follows a consistent trajectory: an exploration phase where probability mass spreads across candidates, tentative commitment to a frontrunner, and either convergence or backtracking.

We present a filtering and segmentation algorithm for detecting precipitates in FIB cross-section micrographs, optimized using linear genetic programming (LGP), which accounts for the various artifacts. To this end, the optimization environment uses a domain-specific language for image processing to iterate on solutions. Programs in this language are a list of image-filtering blocks with tunable parameters that sequentially process an input image, allowing for reliable generation and mutation by a genetic algorithm. Our environment produces optimized human-interpretable MATLAB code representing an image filtering pipeline. Under ideal conditions--a population size of 60 and a maximum program length of 5 blocks--our system was able to find a near-human accuracy solution with an average evaluation error of 1.8% when comparing segmentations pixel-by-pixel to a human baseline using an XOR error evaluation. Our automation work enabled faster iteration cycles and furthered exploration of the material composition and processing space: our optimized pipeline algorithm processes a 3.6 megapixel image in about 2 seconds on average.

While existing studies augment LLMs with various knowledge types, it remains unclear how effectively the additional costs translate into accuracy. In this paper, we explore how meta-cognition of LLMs, i.e., their self-awareness of their own knowledge states, can regulate the reasoning process. Specifically, we propose MedCoG, a Medical Meta-Cognition Agent with Knowledge Graph, where the meta-cognitive assessments of task complexity, familiarity, and knowledge density dynamically regulate utilization of procedural, episodic, and factual knowledge. The LLM-centric on-demand reasoning aims to mitigate scaling laws by (1) reducing costs via avoiding indiscriminate scaling, (2) improving accuracy via filtering out distractive knowledge. To validate this, we empirically characterize the scaling curve and introduce inference density to quantify inference efficiency, defined as the ratio of theoretically effective cost to actual cost. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of MedCoG on five hard sets of medical benchmarks, yielding 5.5x inference density. Furthermore, the Oracle study highlights the significant potential of meta-cognitive regulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMedCoG\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u5bf9\u81ea\u8eab\u77e5\u8bc6\u72b6\u6001\uff08\u5982\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3001\u719f\u6089\u5ea6\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff09\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u63a7\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6027\u3001\u60c5\u666f\u6027\u548c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b05.5\u500d\u63a8\u7406\u5bc6\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u79cd\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u989d\u5916\u5f00\u9500\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6027\u4ef7\u6bd4\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0cLLM\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u6269\u5c55\u89c4\u5f8b\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u6536\u76ca\u9012\u51cf\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMedCoG\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u79cd\u4ee5LLM\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3001\u878d\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3001\u719f\u6089\u5ea6\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff09\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u63a7\u4e09\u7c7b\u77e5\u8bc6\uff08\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6027\u3001\u60c5\u666f\u6027\u3001\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\uff09\u7684\u6309\u9700\u8c03\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u2018\u63a8\u7406\u5bc6\u5ea6\u2019\uff08\u6709\u6548\u6210\u672c/\u5b9e\u9645\u6210\u672c\uff09\u91cf\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u9ad8\u96be\u5ea6\u533b\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86MedCoG\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u5bc6\u5ea6\u8fbe5.5\u500d\uff1bOracle\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63ed\u793a\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u8c03\u63a7\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u7684\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u63a8\u7406\u6269\u5c55\u89c4\u5f8b\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6536\u76ca\u9012\u51cf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u533b\u5b66AI\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Motivated by discrete physics losses and Hierarchical Deep Learning Neural Network (HiDeNN) constructions, we embed finite-element (FEM) computations at nodes and Gauss points directly into message-passing layers and propose a numerically consistent FEM-Informed Hypergraph Neural Networks (FHGNN). Similar to conventional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), training is purely physics-driven and requires no labeled data: the input is a node element hypergraph whose edges encode mesh connectivity. Guided by empirical results and condition-number analysis, we adopt an efficient variational loss. Validated on 3D benchmarks, including cyclic loading with isotropic/kinematic hardening, the proposed method delivers substantially improved accuracy and efficiency over recent, competitive PINN variants. By leveraging GPU-parallel tensor operations and the discrete representation, it scales effectively to large elastoplastic problems and can be competitive with, or faster than, multi-core FEM implementations at comparable accuracy.

Solving this vast challenge requires scalable coral regeneration technologies that can breed climate-resilient species and accelerate the natural regrowth processes; actions that are impeded by the absence of safe and robust tools to handle the fragile coral. We investigate ReefFlex, a generative soft finger design methodology that explores a diverse space of soft fingers to produce a set of candidates capable of safely grasping fragile and geometrically heterogeneous coral in a cluttered environment. Our key insight is encoding heterogeneous grasping into a reduced set of motion primitives, creating a simplified, tractable multi-objective optimisation problem. To evaluate the method, we design a soft robot for reef rehabilitation, which grows and manipulates coral in onshore aquaculture facilities for future reef out-planting. We demonstrate ReefFlex increases both grasp success and grasp quality (disturbance resistance, positioning accuracy) and reduces in adverse events encountered during coral manipulation compared to reference designs. ReefFlex, offers a generalisable method to design soft end-effectors for complex handling and paves a pathway towards automation in previously unachievable domains like coral handling for restoration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faReefFlex\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u8f6f\u6307\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u6293\u53d6\u8106\u5f31\u4e14\u51e0\u4f55\u5f02\u8d28\u7684\u73ca\u745a\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u73ca\u745a\u7901\u4fee\u590d\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7f16\u7801\u5f02\u8d28\u6293\u53d6\u4e3a\u7b80\u5316\u8fd0\u52a8\u57fa\u5143\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u73ca\u745a\u517b\u6b96\u8bbe\u65bd\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u6293\u53d6\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3001\u8d28\u91cf\u53ca\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u826f\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u5165\u4fb5\u7269\u79cd\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u6d3b\u52a8\u6b63\u4ee5\u524d\u6240\u672a\u6709\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u7834\u574f\u5168\u7403\u73ca\u745a\u7901\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u73ca\u745a\u518d\u751f\u6280\u672f\uff1b\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u5904\u7406\u8106\u5f31\u73ca\u745a\u6210\u4e3a\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faReefFlex\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u8f6f\u6307\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u5f02\u8d28\u6293\u53d6\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u4e00\u7ec4\u7b80\u5316\u8fd0\u52a8\u57fa\u5143\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u89e3\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8f6f\u6307\u6784\u578b\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9762\u5411\u73ca\u745a\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "ReefFlex\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u73ca\u745a\u6293\u53d6\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e0e\u6293\u53d6\u8d28\u91cf\uff08\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u6027\u3001\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u64cd\u4f5c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u826f\u4e8b\u4ef6\u53d1\u751f\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "ReefFlex\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u8106\u5f31\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u8f6f\u4f53\u672b\u7aef\u6267\u884c\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u73ca\u745a\u4fee\u590d\u7b49\u6b64\u524d\u96be\u4ee5\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u9886\u57df\u8fc8\u5411\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3002"}}

However, current SAEs are trained per modality, producing dictionaries whose features are not directly understandable and whose explanations do not transfer across domains. In this study, we introduce LUCID (Learning Unified vision-language sparse Codes for Interpretable concept Discovery), a unified vision-language sparse autoencoder that learns a shared latent dictionary for image patch and text token representations, while reserving private capacity for modality-specific details. We achieve feature alignment by coupling the shared codes with a learned optimal transport matching objective without the need of labeling. LUCID yields interpretable shared features that support patch-level grounding, establish cross-modal neuron correspondence, and enhance robustness against the concept clustering problem in similarity-based evaluation. Leveraging the alignment properties, we develop an automated dictionary interpretation pipeline based on term clustering without manual observations. Our analysis reveals that LUCID's shared features capture diverse semantic categories beyond objects, including actions, attributes, and abstract concepts, demonstrating a comprehensive approach to interpretable multimodal representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLUCID\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u6f5c\u5728\u5b57\u5178\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u5339\u914d\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6309\u6a21\u6001\u5355\u72ec\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7279\u5f81\u4e0d\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u89e3\u91ca\u65e0\u6cd5\u8de8\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLUCID\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\u4e0e\u6587\u672ctoken\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6f5c\u5728\u5b57\u5178\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u5339\u914d\u76ee\u6807\u5b9e\u73b0\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u672f\u8bed\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5b57\u5178\u89e3\u91ca\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u83b7\u5f97\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\u7ea7\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5bf9\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u7f13\u89e3\u6982\u5ff5\u805a\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u63ed\u793a\u5171\u4eab\u7279\u5f81\u6db5\u76d6\u5bf9\u8c61\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u3001\u5c5e\u6027\u53ca\u62bd\u8c61\u6982\u5ff5\u7b49\u591a\u5143\u8bed\u4e49\u7c7b\u522b\u3002", "conclusion": "LUCID\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u5f81\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u7f16\u7801\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6982\u5ff5\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Concept unlearning methods aim at reducing the models' likelihood of generating harmful content. Traditionally, this has been tackled at an individual concept level, with only a handful of recent works considering more realistic concept combinations. However, state of the art methods depend on full finetuning, which is computationally expensive. Concept localisation methods can facilitate selective finetuning, but existing techniques are static, resulting in suboptimal utility. In order to tackle these challenges, we propose TRUST (Targeted Robust Selective fine Tuning), a novel approach for dynamically estimating target concept neurons and unlearning them through selective finetuning, empowered by a Hessian based regularization. We show experimentally, against a number of SOTA baselines, that TRUST is robust against adversarial prompts, preserves generation quality to a significant degree, and is also significantly faster than the SOTA.

Prior works on dialogue summary evaluation largely ignore the complexities specific to this task: (i) shift in structure, from multiple speakers discussing information in a scattered fashion across several turns, to a summary's sentences, and (ii) shift in narration viewpoint, from speakers' first/second-person narration, standardized third-person narration in the summary. In this work, we introduce our framework DIALSUMMER to address the above. We propose DIAL-SUMMER's taxonomy of errors to comprehensively evaluate dialogue summaries at two hierarchical levels: DIALOGUE-LEVEL that focuses on the broader speakers/turns, and WITHIN-TURN-LEVEL that focuses on the information talked about inside a turn. We then present DIAL-SUMMER's dataset composed of dialogue summaries manually annotated with our taxonomy's fine-grained errors. We conduct empirical analyses of these annotated errors, and observe interesting trends (e.g., turns occurring in middle of the dialogue are the most frequently missed in the summary, extrinsic hallucinations largely occur at the end of the summary). We also conduct experiments on LLM-Judges' capability at detecting these errors, through which we demonstrate the challenging nature of our dataset, the robustness of our taxonomy, and the need for future work in this field to enhance LLMs' performance in the same.

Hence, we propose CLARITY that dynamically adapts its fusion strategy to the detected scene condition. Guided by vision-language model (VLM) priors, the network learns to modulate each modality's contribution based on the illumination state while leveraging object embeddings for segmentation, rather than applying a fixed fusion policy. We further introduce two mechanisms, i.e., one which preserves valid dark-object semantics that prior noise-suppression methods incorrectly discard, and a hierarchical decoder that enforces structural consistency across scales to sharpen boundaries on thin objects.

This ability, collectively known as general continual learning (GCL), encapsulates practical challenges such as online datastreams and blurry task boundaries. Although leveraging pretrained models (PTMs) has greatly advanced conventional continual learning (CL), these methods remain limited in reconciling the diverse and temporally mixed information along a single pass, resulting in sub-optimal GCL performance. Inspired by meta-plasticity and reconstructive memory in neuroscience, we introduce here an innovative approach named Meta Post-Refinement (MePo) for PTMs-based GCL. This approach constructs pseudo task sequences from pretraining data and develops a bi-level meta-learning paradigm to refine the pretrained backbone, which serves as a prolonged pretraining phase but greatly facilitates rapid adaptation of representation learning to downstream GCL tasks. MePo further initializes a meta covariance matrix as the reference geometry of pretrained representation space, enabling GCL to exploit second-order statistics for robust output alignment. MePo serves as a plug-in strategy that achieves significant performance gains across a variety of GCL benchmarks and pretrained checkpoints in a rehearsal-free manner (e.g., 15.10\\%, 13.36\\%, and 12.56\\% on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R, and CUB-200 under Sup-21/1K).

In particular, a concept of feature unlearning, in which a neural network progressively loses previously learned features over long training, has gained attention. In this study, we consider the infinite-width limit of a two-layer neural network updated with a large-batch stochastic gradient, then derive differential equations with different time scales, revealing the mechanism and conditions for feature unlearning to occur. Specifically, we utilize the fast-slow dynamics: while an alignment of first-layer weights develops rapidly, the second-layer weights develop slowly. The direction of a flow on a critical manifold, determined by the slow dynamics, decides whether feature unlearning occurs. We give numerical validation of the result, and derive theoretical grounding and scaling laws of the feature unlearning. Our results yield the following insights: (i) the strength of the primary nonlinear term in data induces the feature unlearning, and (ii) an initial scale of the second-layer weights mitigates the feature unlearning. Technically, our analysis utilizes Tensor Programs and the singular perturbation theory.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u65e0\u9650\u5bbd\u5ea6\u4e24\u5c42\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u5927\u6279\u6b21\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u9057\u5fd8\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5feb\u6162\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\u4e0e\u6807\u5ea6\u5f8b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u68af\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u7ed3\u6784\u662f\u7406\u8bba\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u800c\u7279\u5f81\u9057\u5fd8\uff08\u5373\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u957f\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u9010\u6b65\u4e22\u5931\u5148\u524d\u5b66\u5230\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff09\u73b0\u8c61\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\u53d7\u5230\u5173\u6ce8\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5f20\u91cf\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff08Tensor Programs\uff09\u548c\u5947\u5f02\u6444\u52a8\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u9650\u5bbd\u5ea6\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u5bf9\u4e24\u5c42\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5feb\u6162\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u7279\u5f81\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u53d1\u751f\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u7279\u5f81\u9057\u5fd8\u7531\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u4e3b\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u9879\u5f3a\u5ea6\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u4e14\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5c42\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53ef\u7f13\u89e3\u8be5\u73b0\u8c61\uff1b\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u7279\u5f81\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u6807\u5ea6\u5f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7279\u5f81\u9057\u5fd8\u662f\u5feb\u6162\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5171\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5176\u53d1\u751f\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u6162\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u6d41\u65b9\u5411\uff1b\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0e\u5b9a\u91cf\u523b\u753b\u3002"}}

To address this limitation, we propose a planning framework that explicitly incorporates user preferences regarding the desired level of safe clearance from surrounding vehicles. We design a questionnaire purposefully tailored to capture user preferences relevant to our framework, while minimizing unnecessary questions. Specifically, the questionnaire considers various interaction-relevant factors, including the surrounding vehicle's size, speed, position, and maneuvers of surrounding vehicles, as well as the maneuvers of the ego vehicle. The response indicates the user-preferred clearance for the scenario defined by the question and is incorporated as constraints in the optimal control problem. However, it is impractical to account for all possible scenarios that may arise in a driving environment within a single optimal control problem, as the resulting computational complexity renders real-time implementation infeasible. To overcome this limitation, we approximate the original problem by decomposing it into multiple subproblems, each dealing with one fixed scenario. We then solve these subproblems in parallel and select one using the cost function from the original problem. To validate our work, we conduct simulations using different user responses to the questionnaire. We assess how effectively our planner reflects user preferences compared to preference-agnostic baseline planners by measuring preference alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u878d\u5408\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u95ee\u5377\u83b7\u53d6\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u5468\u56f4\u8f66\u8f86\u5b89\u5168\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675f\u5d4c\u5165\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u4e3a\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u573a\u666f\u5206\u89e3\u4e0e\u5e76\u884c\u6c42\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9a7e\u9a76\u89c4\u5212\u672a\u8003\u8651\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u5468\u56f4\u8f66\u8f86\u5b89\u5168\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e58\u5750\u4e0d\u9002\uff1b\u9700\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u5e76\u6ee1\u8db3\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9762\u5411\u4ea4\u4e92\u56e0\u7d20\uff08\u5982\u5468\u56f4\u8f66\u5c3a\u5bf8\u3001\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u81ea\u8f66\u884c\u4e3a\uff09\u7684\u7cbe\u7b80\u95ee\u5377\uff0c\u5c06\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8ddd\u79bb\u504f\u597d\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b\u9488\u5bf9\u5168\u573a\u666f\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6309\u56fa\u5b9a\u573a\u666f\u5206\u89e3\u3001\u5e76\u884c\u6c42\u89e3\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u9009\u4f18\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u53cd\u6620\u4e0d\u540c\u7528\u6237\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u5728\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e0d\u8003\u8651\u504f\u597d\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u878d\u5165\u7528\u6237\u5b89\u5168\u8ddd\u79bb\u504f\u597d\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8212\u9002\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u573a\u666f\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u504f\u597d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u3002"}}

While generally structured, these documents are often dense, bureaucratic, and highly heterogeneous across municipalities, exhibiting significant variation in language, terminology, structure, and overall organization. This heterogeneity makes them difficult for non-experts to interpret and challenging for intelligent automated systems to process, limiting public transparency and civic engagement. To address these challenges, computational methods can be employed to structure and interpret such complex documents. In particular, Natural Language Processing (NLP) offers well-established methods that can enhance the accessibility and interpretability of governmental records. In this focus article, we review foundational NLP tasks that support the structuring of local governance meeting documents. Specifically, we review three core tasks: document segmentation, domain-specific entity extraction and automatic text summarization, which are essential for navigating lengthy deliberations, identifying political actors and personal information, and generating concise representations of complex decision-making processes. In reviewing these tasks, we discuss methodological approaches, evaluation metrics, and publicly available resources, while highlighting domain-specific challenges such as data scarcity, privacy constraints, and source variability. By synthesizing existing work across these foundational tasks, this article provides a structured overview of how NLP can enhance the structuring and accessibility of local governance meeting records.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\uff08NLP\uff09\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u548c\u89e3\u8bfb\u5730\u65b9\u6cbb\u7406\u4f1a\u8bae\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e2d\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u7840\u4efb\u52a1\uff1a\u6587\u6863\u5206\u5272\u3001\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u5b9e\u4f53\u62bd\u53d6\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u6587\u672c\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3001\u53ef\u7528\u8d44\u6e90\u53ca\u9886\u57df\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u5730\u65b9\u6cbb\u7406\u4f1a\u8bae\u8bb0\u5f55\u867d\u5177\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u56e0\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u672f\u8bed\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u7b49\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u88ab\u975e\u4e13\u5bb6\u7406\u89e3\u4e14\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5904\u7406\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u653f\u52a1\u900f\u660e\u4e0e\u516c\u4f17\u53c2\u4e0e\u3002", "method": "\u7efc\u8ff0NLP\u4e2d\u4e09\u9879\u57fa\u7840\u4efb\u52a1\uff1a\u6587\u6863\u5206\u5272\u3001\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u5b9e\u4f53\u62bd\u53d6\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u6587\u672c\u6458\u8981\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u5176\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3001\u516c\u5f00\u8d44\u6e90\u53ca\u9886\u57df\u6311\u6218\uff08\u5982\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u9650\u5236\u3001\u6765\u6e90\u5dee\u5f02\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u68b3\u7406\u4e86NLP\u652f\u6301\u5730\u65b9\u6cbb\u7406\u4f1a\u8bae\u6587\u6863\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u96be\u70b9\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u653f\u52a1\u6587\u6863\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u6846\u67b6\u6027\u53c2\u8003\u3002", "conclusion": "NLP\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u5730\u65b9\u6cbb\u7406\u4f1a\u8bae\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e0e\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u7b49\u73b0\u5b9e\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose a unified optimization framework that reinterprets prior art as implicit strategies to avoid these corrupted regions. Based on this insight, we introduce Adaptive Matching Distillation (AMD), a self-correcting mechanism that utilizes reward proxies to explicitly detect and escape Forbidden Zones. AMD dynamically prioritizes corrective gradients via structural signal decomposition and introduces Repulsive Landscape Sharpening to enforce steep energy barriers against failure mode collapse. Extensive experiments across image and video generation tasks (e.g., SDXL, Wan2.1) and rigorous benchmarks (e.g., VBench, GenEval) demonstrate that AMD significantly enhances sample fidelity and training robustness. For instance, AMD improves the HPSv2 score on SDXL from 30.64 to 31.25, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

This disparity restricts insect-scale robots to operation within motion capture environments, substantially limiting their applicability to tasks such as search-and-rescue and precision agriculture. In this work, we present a 1.29-gram aerial robot capable of hovering and tracking trajectories with solely onboard sensing and computation. The combination of a sensor suite, estimators, and a low-level controller achieved centimeter-scale positional flight accuracy. Additionally, we developed a hierarchical controller in which a human operator provides high-level commands to direct the robot's motion. In a 30-second flight experiment conducted outside a motion capture system, the robot avoided obstacles and ultimately landed on a sunflower. This level of sensing and computational autonomy represents a significant advancement for the aerial microrobotics community, further opening opportunities to explore onboard planning and power autonomy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u673a\u8f7d\u4f20\u611f\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u60ac\u505c\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u76841.29\u514b\u5fae\u578b\u7a7a\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5398\u7c73\u7ea7\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u65e0\u52a8\u4f5c\u6355\u6349\u7cfb\u7edf\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u6210\u529f\u5b8c\u6210\u907f\u969c\u4e0e\u7740\u9646\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6606\u866b\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff08\u5982\u641c\u7d22\u6551\u63f4\u3001\u7cbe\u51c6\u519c\u4e1a\uff09\u5e94\u7528\uff1b\u800c\u81ea\u7136\u754c\u7684\u7a7a\u4e2d\u6606\u866b\u5374\u80fd\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u5bc6\u96c6\u690d\u88ab\uff0c\u8be5\u5dee\u8ddd\u4fc3\u4f7f\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5f00\u53d1\u5177\u5907\u5b8c\u5168\u673a\u8f7d\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5fae\u578b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5957\u4ef6\u3001\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u4f4e\u5c42\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f4d\u7f6e\u63a7\u5236\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u5206\u5c42\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u7531\u4eba\u7c7b\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u5c42\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u81ea\u4e3b\u6267\u884c\u5e95\u5c42\u8fd0\u52a8\uff1b\u5728\u65e0\u52a8\u4f5c\u6355\u6349\u7684\u5ba4\u5916\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u98de\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5398\u7c73\u7ea7\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u60ac\u505c\u4e0e\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff1b\u572830\u79d2\u5ba4\u5916\u98de\u884c\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u907f\u969c\u5e76\u7cbe\u51c6\u964d\u843d\u5728\u5411\u65e5\u8475\u4e0a\uff1b\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u5982\u6b64\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5bf8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u673a\u8f7d\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u95ed\u73af\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5fae\u578b\u7a7a\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u673a\u8f7d\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u80fd\u91cf\u81ea\u4e3b\u7b49\u65b9\u5411\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u5fae\u578b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u5316\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

We test whether LLMs form the same kinds of conventions in a multimodal communication game. Both humans and LLMs display evidence of convention-formation (increasing the accuracy and consistency of their turns while decreasing their length) when communicating in same-type dyads (humans with humans, AI with AI). However, heterogenous human-AI pairs fail -- suggesting differences in communicative tendencies. In Experiment 2, we ask whether LLMs can be induced to behave more like human conversants, by prompting them to produce superficially humanlike behavior. While the length of their messages matches that of human pairs, accuracy and lexical overlap in human-LLM pairs continues to lag behind that of both human-human and AI-AI pairs. These results suggest that conversational alignment requires more than just the ability to mimic previous interactions, but also shared interpretative biases toward the meanings that are conveyed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u6d41\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5f62\u6210\u7c7b\u4f3c\u5bf9\u8bdd\u60ef\u4f8b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u540c\u8d28\u914d\u5bf9\uff08\u4eba-\u4eba\u6216AI-AI\uff09\u53ef\u5f62\u6210\u6709\u6548\u60ef\u4f8b\uff0c\u800c\u5f02\u8d28\u914d\u5bf9\uff08\u4eba-AI\uff09\u5219\u5931\u8d25\uff1b\u5373\u4f7f\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u8ba9LLM\u6a21\u4eff\u4eba\u7c7b\u8868\u8fbe\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5176\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8bcd\u6c47\u91cd\u53e0\u4ecd\u4e0d\u53ca\u4eba-\u4eba\u6216AI-AI\u914d\u5bf9\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u4eff\uff0c\u66f4\u9700\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u610f\u4e49\u89e3\u91ca\u503e\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u50cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e00\u6837\u5f62\u6210\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u6c9f\u901a\u60ef\u4f8b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4eba\u4e0eAI\u4e4b\u95f4\u80fd\u5426\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6c9f\u901a\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u540c\u8d28\uff08\u4eba-\u4eba\u3001AI-AI\uff09\u4e0e\u5f02\u8d28\uff08\u4eba-AI\uff09\u914d\u5bf9\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c2\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfcLLM\u751f\u6210\u7c7b\u4eba\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u56de\u5e94\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5206\u6790\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u8bcd\u6c47\u91cd\u53e0\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u540c\u8d28\u914d\u5bf9\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u60ef\u4f8b\u5f62\u6210\uff08\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0a\u5347\u3001\u54cd\u5e94\u53d8\u77ed\uff09\uff1b\u5f02\u8d28\u914d\u5bf9\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\uff1b\u63d0\u793a\u4f7fLLM\u54cd\u5e94\u957f\u5ea6\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\uff0c\u4f46\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8bcd\u6c47\u91cd\u53e0\u4ecd\u663e\u8457\u4f4e\u4e8e\u540c\u8d28\u914d\u5bf9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9700\u8981\u6a21\u4eff\u8868\u5c42\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u66f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6df1\u5c42\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u89e3\u91ca\u503e\u5411\uff1b\u5f53\u524dLLM\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u6c9f\u901a\u9e3f\u6c9f\u3002"}}

However, as the amount of context grows, their reliability often deteriorates, a phenomenon known as \"context rot\". Existing long-context benchmarks primarily focus on single-step settings that evaluate a model's ability to retrieve information from a long snippet. In realistic scenarios, however, LLMs often need to act as agents that explore environments, follow instructions and plans, extract useful information, and predict correct actions under a dynamically growing context. To assess language agents in such settings, we introduce LOCA-bench (a benchmark for LOng-Context Agents). Given a task prompt, LOCA-bench leverages automated and scalable control of environment states to regulate the agent's context length. This design enables LOCA-bench to extend the context length potentially to infinity in a controlled way while keeping the underlying task semantics fixed. LOCA-bench evaluates language agents as a combination of models and scaffolds, including various context management strategies. While agent performance generally degrades as the environment states grow more complex, advanced context management techniques can substantially improve the overall success rate. We open-source LOCA-bench to provide a platform for evaluating models and scaffolds in long-context, agentic scenarios: https://github.com/hkust-nlp/LOCA-bench", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LOCA-bench\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bed\u8a00\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff08language agents\uff09\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u589e\u957f\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\uff08\u5373'context rot'\uff09\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u591a\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u5355\u6b65\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u53cd\u6620\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8bed\u8a00\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9700\u6301\u7eed\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86LOCA-bench\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u73af\u5883\u72b6\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53ef\u63a7\u5730\u5ef6\u957f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\uff08\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u53ef\u8fbe\u65e0\u9650\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u53d8\uff1b\u652f\u6301\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5404\u7c7b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ba1\u7406'scaffold'\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u8054\u5408\u8bc4\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u73af\u5883\u72b6\u6001\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u666e\u904d\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4f46\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ba1\u7406\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "LOCA-bench\u4e3a\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001\u5177\u8eab\u5f0f\uff08agentic\uff09\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e0escaffold\u534f\u540c\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f00\u6e90\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b0\u5e73\u53f0\u3002"}}

We present BitLogic, a fully gradient-based, end-to-end trainable framework for FPGA-native neural networks built around Lookup Table (LUT) computation. BitLogic replaces multiply-accumulate operations with differentiable LUT nodes that map directly to FPGA primitives, enabling native binary computation, sparse connectivity, and efficient hardware realization. The framework offers a modular functional API supporting diverse architectures, along with learned encoders, hardware-aware heads, and multiple boundary-consistent LUT relaxations. An automated Register Transfer Level (RTL) export pipeline translates trained PyTorch models into synthesizable HDL, ensuring equivalence between software and hardware inference. Experiments across standard vision benchmarks and heterogeneous hardware platforms demonstrate competitive accuracy and substantial gains in FPGA efficiency, including 72.3% test accuracy on CIFAR-10 achieved with fewer than 0.3M logic gates, while attaining sub-20 ns single-sample inference using only LUT resources.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faBitLogic\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u67e5\u627e\u8868\uff08LUT\uff09\u8282\u70b9\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u4e58\u52a0\u8fd0\u7b97\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684FPGA\u539f\u751f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6781\u4f4e\u786c\u4ef6\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6210\u672c\u65e5\u76ca\u7531\u90e8\u7f72\u4e3b\u5bfc\u800c\u975e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5bf9\u7b97\u672f\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u4e13\u7528\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff1b\u73b0\u6709FPGA\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u65b9\u6cd5\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBitLogic\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u68af\u5ea6\u9a71\u52a8\u3001\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684FPGA\u539f\u751f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ef\u5fae\u5206LUT\u8282\u70b9\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u6620\u5c04FPGA\u67e5\u627e\u8868\u539f\u8bed\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u6a21\u5757\u5316API\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001\u786c\u4ef6\u611f\u77e5\u8f93\u51fa\u5934\u53ca\u591a\u79cd\u8fb9\u754c\u4e00\u81f4\u7684LUT\u677e\u5f1b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u914d\u5907\u81ea\u52a8RTL\u5bfc\u51fa\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c06PyTorch\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u4e3a\u7b49\u6548\u53ef\u7efc\u5408HDL\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-10\u4e0a\u8fbe72.3%\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ec5\u7528<0.3M\u903b\u8f91\u95e8\uff1b\u5355\u6837\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf<20 ns\uff0c\u4e14\u7eaf\u4f7f\u7528LUT\u8d44\u6e90\uff1b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u5f02\u6784\u786c\u4ef6\u5e73\u53f0\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u4e0eFPGA\u6548\u7387\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "BitLogic\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eLUT\u7684\u5168\u53ef\u5fae\u3001\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u8def\u5f84\u5728FPGA\u4e0a\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u3001\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u8fb9\u7f18AI\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

While parallelization offers scalability, existing hybrid CPU-GPU solvers face critical bottlenecks due to host-device synchronization latency and branch divergence on SIMT architectures, limiting their utility for real-time planning and hindering real-robot deployment. We present Vec-QMDP, a CPU-native parallel planner that aligns POMDP search with modern CPUs' SIMD architecture, achieving $227\\times$--$1073\\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art serial planners. Vec-QMDP adopts a Data-Oriented Design (DOD), refactoring scattered, pointer-based data structures into contiguous, cache-efficient memory layouts. We further introduce a hierarchical parallelism scheme: distributing sub-trees across independent CPU cores and SIMD lanes, enabling fully vectorized tree expansion and collision checking. Efficiency is maximized with the help of UCB load balancing across trees and a vectorized STR-tree for coarse-level collision checking.

This work explores an alternative axis: increasing per-token computation without expanding parameters, by internalizing latent Chain-of-Thought (CoT) into pretraining. We propose Pretraining with Token-Level Adaptive Latent CoT (adaptive latent CoT), where the model generates a variable-length latent CoT trajectory before emitting each token -- allocating longer trajectories to difficult tokens and shorter (or even zero) trajectories to easy ones. Importantly, this behavior emerges naturally from one-stage pretraining on general text and reduces computation in both training and inference via token-wise adaptive halting. Experiments with Llama architectures show that adaptive latent CoT consistently improves language modeling perplexity and broad downstream accuracy, even with fewer training FLOPs than prior recurrent baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u5185\u5316\u9690\u5f0f\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\uff08latent CoT\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2atoken\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u914d\u53ef\u53d8\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8bed\u6599\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u53c2\u6570\u6216\u6570\u636e\u589e\u957f\u7684\u65b0\u6269\u5c55\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPretraining with Token-Level Adaptive Latent CoT\uff1a\u5728\u901a\u7528\u6587\u672c\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\uff0c\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8f93\u51fatoken\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u53d8\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u9690\u5f0fCoT\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7token\u7ea7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u505c\u673a\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8282\u7ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728Llama\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u66f4\u4f4eFLOPs\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u964d\u4f4e\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u5faa\u73af\u5f0f\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5185\u5316\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9690\u5f0fCoT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u2018\u6bcftoken\u8ba1\u7b97\u6269\u5c55\u2019\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u6027\u80fd\u589e\u76ca\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u6807\u6ce8\u6216\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002"}}

To address this gap, we introduce EXPERIGEN, an agentic framework that operationalizes end-to-end discovery through a Bayesian optimization inspired two-phase search, in which a Generator proposes candidate hypotheses and an Experimenter evaluates them empirically. Across multiple domains, EXPERIGEN consistently discovers 2-4x more statistically significant hypotheses that are 7-17 percent more predictive than prior approaches, and naturally extends to complex data regimes including multimodal and relational datasets. Beyond statistical performance, hypotheses must be novel, empirically grounded, and actionable to drive real scientific progress. To evaluate these qualities, we conduct an expert review of machine-generated hypotheses, collecting feedback from senior faculty. Among 25 reviewed hypotheses, 88 percent were rated moderately or strongly novel, 70 percent were deemed impactful and worth pursuing, and most demonstrated rigor comparable to senior graduate-level research.

We propose the first BO algorithm that achieves no-regret guarantee in a general reward setting, requiring only Lipschitz continuity of the objective function and accommodating a broad class of measurement noise. The core of our approach is a novel surrogate model, termed as infinite Gaussian process ($\\infty$-GP). It is a Bayesian nonparametric model that places a prior on the space of reward distributions, enabling it to represent a substantially broader class of reward models than classical Gaussian process (GP). The $\\infty$-GP is used in combination with Thompson Sampling (TS) to enable effective exploration and exploitation. Correspondingly, we develop a new TS regret analysis framework for general rewards, which relates the regret to the total variation distance between the surrogate model and the true reward distribution.

Unlike standard locomotion or static manipulation, this task demands a seamless integration of explosive whole-body coordination and precise, timing-critical interception. While recent advances have achieved lifelike motion mimicry, bridging the gap between kinematic imitation and functional, physics-aware striking without compromising stylistic naturalness is non-trivial. To address this, we propose Imitation-to-Interaction, a progressive reinforcement learning framework designed to evolve a robot from a \"mimic\" to a capable \"striker.\" Our approach establishes a robust motor prior from human data, distills it into a compact, model-based state representation, and stabilizes dynamics via adversarial priors. Crucially, to overcome the sparsity of expert demonstrations, we introduce a manifold expansion strategy that generalizes discrete strike points into a dense interaction volume. We validate our framework through the mastery of diverse skills, including lifts and drop shots, in simulation.

However, progress has been hindered by the lack of large-scale datasets providing both ECG images and their corresponding ground truth signals with comprehensive annotations. We introduce PTB-XL-Image-17K, a complete synthetic ECG image dataset comprising 17,271 high-quality 12-lead ECG images generated from the PTB-XL signal database. Our dataset uniquely provides five complementary data types per sample: (1) realistic ECG images with authentic grid patterns and annotations (50% with visible grid, 50% without), (2) pixel-level segmentation masks, (3) ground truth time-series signals, (4) bounding box annotations in YOLO format for both lead regions and lead name labels, and (5) comprehensive metadata including visual parameters and patient information. We present an open-source Python framework enabling customizable dataset generation with controllable parameters including paper speed (25/50 mm/s), voltage scale (5/10 mm/mV), sampling rate (500 Hz), grid appearance (4 colors), and waveform characteristics.

In response to this unresolved dilemma, we introduce RAPS, a reputation-aware publish-subscribe paradigm for adaptive, scalable, and robust coordination of LLM agents. RAPS is grounded in the Distributed Publish-Subscribe Protocol, allowing LLM agents to exchange messages based on their declared intents rather than predefined topologies. Beyond this substrate, RAPS further incorporates two coherent overlays: (i) Reactive Subscription, enabling agents to dynamically refine their intents; and (ii) Bayesian Reputation, empowering each agent with a local watchdog to detect and isolate malicious peers.

Capturing chirality in machine learning models remains challenging due to the geometric complexity of stereochemical relationships and the limitations of traditional molecular representations that often lack explicit stereochemical encoding. Existing approaches to chiral molecular representation primarily focus on central chirality, relying on handcrafted stereochemical tags or limited 3D encodings, and thus fail to generalize to more complex forms such as axial chirality. In this work, we introduce ChiDeK (Chiral Determinant Kernels), a framework that systematically integrates stereogenic information into molecular representation learning. We propose the chiral determinant kernel to encode the SE(3)-invariant chirality matrix and employ cross-attention to integrate stereochemical information from local chiral centers into the global molecular representation. This design enables explicit modeling of chiral-related features within a unified architecture, capable of jointly encoding central and axial chirality. To support the evaluation of axial chirality, we construct a new benchmark for electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and optical rotation (OR) prediction. Across four tasks, including R/S configuration classification, enantiomer ranking, ECD spectrum prediction, and OR prediction, ChiDeK achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, most notably yielding over 7% higher accuracy on axially chiral tasks on average.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faChiDeK\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u624b\u6027\u884c\u5217\u5f0f\u6838\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e0e\u8f74\u5411\u624b\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u624b\u6027\u5206\u5b50\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u624b\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5bf9\u8f74\u5411\u624b\u6027\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u5f62\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u8868\u793a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u663e\u5f0f\u7acb\u4f53\u5316\u5b66\u7f16\u7801\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u624b\u6027\u884c\u5217\u5f0f\u6838\u4ee5\u7f16\u7801SE(3)-\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u624b\u6027\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c06\u5c40\u90e8\u624b\u6027\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5165\u5168\u5c40\u5206\u5b50\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e0e\u8f74\u5411\u624b\u6027\u7684\u8054\u5408\u7f16\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u5728R/S\u6784\u578b\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u5bf9\u6620\u4f53\u6392\u5e8f\u3001ECD\u8c31\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u5149\u5b66\u65cb\u8f6c\u9884\u6d4b\u56db\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u8d85\u8d8aSOTA\uff1b\u8f74\u5411\u624b\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u8d857%\u3002", "conclusion": "ChiDeK\u4e3a\u624b\u6027\u5206\u5b50\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u624b\u6027\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u4e2d\u5fc3/\u8f74\u5411\uff09\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u3002"}}

To address this, we introduce BiManiBench, a hierarchical benchmark evaluating MLLMs across three tiers: fundamental spatial reasoning, high-level action planning, and low-level end-effector control. Our framework isolates unique bimanual challenges, such as arm reachability and kinematic constraints, thereby distinguishing perceptual hallucinations from planning failures. Analysis of over 30 state-of-the-art models reveals that despite high-level reasoning proficiency, MLLMs struggle with dual-arm spatial grounding and control, frequently resulting in mutual interference and sequencing errors.

To fill this gap, we introduce the first conceptual and methodological framework for unintended CUA behaviors, by defining their key characteristics, automatically eliciting them, and analyzing how they arise from benign inputs. We propose AutoElicit: an agentic framework that iteratively perturbs benign instructions using CUA execution feedback, and elicits severe harms while keeping perturbations realistic and benign. Using AutoElicit, we surface hundreds of harmful unintended behaviors from state-of-the-art CUAs such as Claude 4.5 Haiku and Opus. We further evaluate the transferability of human-verified successful perturbations, identifying persistent susceptibility to unintended behaviors across various other frontier CUAs. This work establishes a foundation for systematically analyzing unintended behaviors in realistic computer-use settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee3\u7406\uff08CUAs\uff09\u610f\u5916\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0e\u65b9\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6AutoElicit\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u6267\u884c\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u6307\u4ee4\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8f93\u5165\u826f\u6027\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u81ea\u52a8\u63ed\u793a\u5927\u91cf\u4e25\u91cd\u4f46\u610f\u5916\u7684\u6709\u5bb3\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbfCUAs\u4e0a\u7684\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9CUA\u610f\u5916\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u4e3a\u8f76\u4e8b\u6027\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5176\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u957f\u5c3e\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u523b\u753b\u4e0e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u63a2\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAutoElicit\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u4ee5CUA\u6267\u884c\u53cd\u9988\u4e3a\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u6270\u52a8\u826f\u6027\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u5408\u7406\u6027\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u826f\u6027\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u89e6\u53d1\u4e25\u91cd\u610f\u5916\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u6270\u52a8\u5728\u4e0d\u540cCUAs\u95f4\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728Claude 4.5 Haiku\u548cOpus\u7b49\u524d\u6cbfCUAs\u4e0a\u6210\u529f\u63ed\u793a\u6570\u767e\u79cd\u6709\u5bb3\u610f\u5916\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u786e\u8ba4\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6270\u52a8\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u524d\u6cbfCUAs\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u98ce\u9669\u5177\u6709\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u666e\u9002\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u9762\u5411\u771f\u5b9e\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4f7f\u7528\u573a\u666f\u7684CUA\u610f\u5916\u884c\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u5206\u6790\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Existing large-scale models often suffer from prohibitive computational costs, while lightweight alternatives typically compromise on holistic facial representations and temporal stability. In this paper, we propose SoulX-FlashHead, a unified 1.3B-parameter framework designed for real-time, infinite-length, and high-fidelity streaming video generation. To address the instability of audio features in streaming scenarios, we introduce Streaming-Aware Spatiotemporal Pre-training equipped with a Temporal Audio Context Cache mechanism, which ensures robust feature extraction from short audio fragments. Furthermore, to mitigate the error accumulation and identity drift inherent in long-sequence autoregressive generation, we propose Oracle-Guided Bidirectional Distillation, leveraging ground-truth motion priors to provide precise physical guidance. We also present VividHead, a large-scale, high-quality dataset containing 782 hours of strictly aligned footage to support robust training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SoulX-FlashHead achieves state-of-the-art performance on HDTF and VFHQ benchmarks.

Since clinical decision-making is inherently collaborative, we challenge the monolithic scaling paradigm and ask whether a Small Agent Group (SAG) can support better clinical reasoning. SAG shifts from single-model intelligence to collective expertise by distributing reasoning, evidence-based analysis, and critical audit through a collaborative deliberation process. To assess the clinical utility of SAG, we conduct extensive evaluations using diverse clinical metrics spanning effectiveness, reliability, and deployment cost. Our results show that SAG achieves superior performance compared to a single giant model, both with and without additional optimization or retrieval-augmented generation.

While optimal algorithms are known for each measure individually, there is no known algorithm achieving optimal bounds for both simultaneously. Marinov and Zimmert [2021] first showed that such simultaneous optimality is impossible against an adaptive adversary. Our work takes a first step to demonstrate its possibility against an oblivious adversary when losses are deterministic. First, we extend the impossibility result of Marinov and Zimmert [2021] to the case of deterministic losses. Then, we present an algorithm achieving optimal static and dynamic regret simultaneously against an oblivious adversary. Together, they reveal a fundamental separation between adaptive and oblivious adversaries when multiple regret benchmarks are considered simultaneously. It also provides new insight into the long open problem of simultaneously achieving optimal regret against switching benchmarks of different numbers of switches.\n  Our algorithm uses negative static regret to compensate for the exploration overhead incurred when controlling dynamic regret, and leverages Blackwell approachability to jointly control both regrets.

We propose Graph-Loc, a graph-based localization framework that tracks the platform pose against compact structural map priors represented as a lightweight point-line graph. Such priors can be constructed from heterogeneous sources commonly available in practice, including polygon outlines vectorized from occupancy/grid maps and CAD/model/floor-plan layouts. For each incoming LiDAR scan, Graph-Loc extracts sparse point and line primitives to form an observation graph, retrieves a pose-conditioned visible subgraph via LiDAR ray simulation, and performs scan-to-map association through unbalanced optimal transport with a local graph-context regularizer. The unbalanced formulation relaxes mass conservation, improving robustness to missing, spurious, and fragmented structures under occlusion. To enhance stability in low-observability segments, we estimate information anisotropy from the refinement normal matrix and defer updates along weakly constrained directions until sufficient constraints reappear. Experiments on public benchmarks, controlled stress tests, and real-world deployments demonstrate accurate and stable tracking with KB-level priors from heterogeneous map sources, including under geometrically degenerate and sustained occlusion and in the presence of gradual scene changes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Graph-Loc\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684LiDAR\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u70b9\u7ebf\u56fe\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7d27\u51d1\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u3001\u91cd\u590d\u3001\u4e25\u91cd\u906e\u6321\u7684LiDAR\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u4f4d\u59ff\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u5730\u56fe\u7684LiDAR\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9762\u4e34\u5730\u56fe\u5b58\u50a8\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u5728\u7ebf\u89c2\u6d4b\u5e38\u5b58\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u6027\u3001\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u4e0e\u4e25\u91cd\u906e\u6321\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u517c\u987e\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u70b9\u7ebf\u56fe\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\uff08\u53ef\u6e90\u81ea\u6805\u683c\u5730\u56fe\u77e2\u91cf\u5316\u3001CAD/\u5e73\u9762\u56fe\u7b49\u5f02\u6784\u6e90\uff09\uff1b\u5bf9\u6bcf\u5e27LiDAR\u626b\u63cf\u63d0\u53d6\u7a00\u758f\u70b9\u7ebf\u5f62\u6210\u89c2\u6d4b\u56fe\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7LiDAR\u5149\u7ebf\u6a21\u62df\u68c0\u7d22\u59ff\u6001\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u53ef\u89c1\u5b50\u56fe\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u5e26\u5c40\u90e8\u56fe\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6b63\u5219\u9879\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u8fdb\u884c\u626b\u63cf-\u5730\u56fe\u5339\u914d\uff1b\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6cd5\u7ebf\u77e9\u9635\u4f30\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5f31\u7ea6\u675f\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6\u3001\u53d7\u63a7\u538b\u529b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u5747\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86Graph-Loc\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700KB\u7ea7\u5f02\u6784\u5730\u56fe\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u9000\u5316\u3001\u6301\u7eed\u906e\u6321\u53ca\u573a\u666f\u7f13\u6162\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "Graph-Loc\u4e3a\u957f\u671f\u81ea\u4e3b\u8fd0\u884c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316LiDAR\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73b0\u5b9e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In this work, we investigate unsupervised approaches to enhance the long-context capabilities of LLMs, eliminating the need for heavy human annotations or teacher models' supervision. Specifically, we first replace a few paragraphs with special placeholders in a long document. LLMs are trained through reinforcement learning to reconstruct the document by correctly identifying and sequencing missing paragraphs from a set of candidate options. This training paradigm enables the model to capture global narrative coherence, significantly boosting long-context performance. We validate the effectiveness of our method on two widely used benchmarks, RULER and LongBench~v2. While acquiring noticeable gains on RULER, it can also achieve a reasonable improvement on LongBench~v2 without any manually curated long-context QA data.

Existing evaluators frequently struggle with a critical perception gap we term \"Attention Collapse,\" where models neglect cross-image comparisons and fail to capture fine-grained details, resulting in inaccurate perception and miscalibrated scores. To address these limitations, we propose SpatialReward, a reward model that enforces precise verification via explicit spatial reasoning. By anchoring reasoning to predicted edit regions, SpatialReward grounds semantic judgments in pixel-level evidence, significantly enhancing evaluative accuracy. Trained on a curated 260k spatial-aware dataset, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on MMRB2 and EditReward-Bench, and outperforms proprietary evaluators on our proposed MultiEditReward-Bench. Furthermore, SpatialReward serves as a robust signal in online RL, boosting OmniGen2 by +0.90 on GEdit-Bench--surpassing the leading discriminative model and doubling the gain of GPT-4.1 (+0.45).

This work presents a structure-aware and robustness-oriented counterfactual search method based on the conditional Gaussian network classifier (CGNC). The CGNC has a generative structure that encodes conditional dependencies and potential causal relations among features through a directed acyclic graph (DAG). This structure naturally embeds feature relationships into the search process, eliminating the need for additional constraints to ensure consistency with the model's structural assumptions. We adopt a convergence-guaranteed cutting-set procedure as an adversarial optimization framework, which iteratively approximates solutions that satisfy global robustness conditions. To address the nonconvex quadratic structure induced by feature dependencies, we apply piecewise McCormick relaxation to reformulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), ensuring global optimality. Experimental results show that our method achieves strong robustness, with direct global optimization of the original formulation providing especially stable and efficient results.

However, a theoretical understanding of why sign-based updates outperform variance-adapted methods remains elusive. In this paper, we aim to bridge the gap between theory and practice through the lens of heavy-tailed gradient noise, a phenomenon frequently observed in language modeling tasks. Theoretically, we introduce a novel generalized heavy-tailed noise condition that captures the behavior of LLMs more accurately than standard finite variance assumptions. Under this noise model, we establish sharp convergence rates of SignSGD and Lion for generalized smooth function classes, matching or surpassing previous best-known bounds. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to Muon and Muonlight, providing what is, to our knowledge, the first rigorous analysis of matrix optimization under heavy-tailed stochasticity. These results offer a strong theoretical justification for the empirical superiority of sign-based optimizers, showcasing that they are naturally suited to handle the noisy gradients associated with heavy tails.

This capability enables embodied AI agents to perform complex tasks, without involvement of an expert, making human-robot interaction (HRI) more convenient. However these developments raise significant security and privacy challenges such as self-preferencing, where a single LLM service provider dominates the market and uses this power to promote their own preferences. LLM oracles have been recently proposed as a mechanism to decentralize LLMs by executing multiple LLMs from different vendors and aggregating their outputs to obtain a more reliable and trustworthy final result. However, the accuracy of these approaches highly depends on the aggregation method. The current aggregation methods mostly use semantic similarity between various LLM outputs, not suitable for robotic task planning, where the temporal order of tasks is important. To fill the gap, we propose an LLM oracle with a new aggregation method for robotic task planning. In addition, we propose a decentralized multi-robot infrastructure based on Hyperledger Fabric that can host the proposed oracle. The proposed infrastructure enables users to express their natural language intent to the system, which then can be decomposed into subtasks.

While prior work observed that convexity and efficiency co-occur in color naming, the analytical relation between them and why they co-occur have not been well understood. We address this gap by combining analytical and empirical analyses that build on the Information Bottleneck (IB) framework for semantic efficiency. First, we show that convexity and efficiency are distinct in the sense that neither entails the other: there are convex systems which are inefficient, and optimally-efficient systems that are non-convex. Crucially, however, the IB-optimal systems are mostly convex in the domain of color naming, explaining the main empirical basis for the convexity approach. Second, we show that efficiency is a stronger predictor for discriminating attested color naming systems from hypothetical variants, with convexity adding negligible improvement on top of that. Finally, we discuss a range of empirical phenomena that convexity cannot account for but efficiency can. Taken together, our work suggests that while convexity and efficiency can yield similar structural observations, they are fundamentally distinct, with efficiency providing a more comprehensive account of semantic typology.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\uff08IB\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790\u8bed\u4e49\u8303\u7574\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u51f8\u6027\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e8c\u8005\u867d\u5e38\u5171\u73b0\u4f46\u672c\u8d28\u72ec\u7acb\uff1b\u6548\u7387\u662f\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u66f4\u591a\u7ecf\u9a8c\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bed\u4e49\u8303\u7574\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u51f8\u6027\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u5171\u73b0\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u53ca\u5176\u5185\u5728\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u4e8c\u8005\u5206\u6790\u5173\u7cfb\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u89e3\u6790\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\uff08IB\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u5efa\u6a21\u8bed\u4e49\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u989c\u8272\u547d\u540d\u9886\u57df\u68c0\u9a8c\u51f8\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "1\uff09\u51f8\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u4e92\u4e0d\u8574\u542b\uff1b2\uff09IB\u6700\u4f18\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u989c\u8272\u547d\u540d\u4e2d\u591a\u4e3a\u51f8\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u51f8\u6027\u5047\u8bf4\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u57fa\u7840\uff1b3\uff09\u6548\u7387\u6bd4\u51f8\u6027\u66f4\u80fd\u533a\u5206\u771f\u5b9e\u4e0e\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u989c\u8272\u547d\u540d\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1b4\uff09\u6548\u7387\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u51f8\u6027\u65e0\u6cd5\u6db5\u76d6\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u7ecf\u9a8c\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u51f8\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u867d\u4ea7\u751f\u76f8\u4f3c\u7ed3\u6784\u89c2\u5bdf\uff0c\u4f46\u672c\u8d28\u4e0d\u540c\uff1b\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u89e3\u91ca\u529b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7c7b\u578b\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

The effectiveness of these Artificial Intelligence (AI) models depends on the quality and accessibility of publicly available datasets, which provide the basis for training and analyzing classification algorithms. Although several public waste classification datasets exist, they remain fragmented, inconsistent, and biased toward specific environments. Differences in class names, annotation formats, image conditions, and class distributions make it difficult to combine these datasets or train models that generalize well to real world scenarios. To address these issues, we introduce the GlobalWasteData (GWD) archive, a large scale dataset of 89,807 images across 14 main categories, annotated with 68 distinct subclasses. We compile this novel integrated GWD archive by merging multiple publicly available datasets into a single, unified resource. This GWD archive offers consistent labeling, improved domain diversity, and more balanced class representation, enabling the development of robust and generalizable waste recognition models. Additional preprocessing steps such as quality filtering, duplicate removal, and metadata generation further improve dataset reliability.

We attribute this to a fundamental architectural flaw: standard LLMs operate as \"malloc-only\" engines, continuously accumulating valid and redundant steps alike without a mechanism to prune obsolete information. To break this cycle, we propose Free()LM, a model that introduces an intrinsic self-forgetting capability via the Free-Module, a plug-and-play LoRA adapter. By iteratively switching between reasoning and cleaning modes, Free()LM dynamically identifies and prunes useless context chunks, maintaining a compact and noise-free state.\n  Extensive experiments show that Free()LM provides consistent improvements across all model scales (8B to 685B).

While deep learning shows promise in processing B-rep models, existing methods suffer from a representation gap: continuous approaches offer analytical precision but are visually abstract, whereas discrete methods provide intuitive clarity at the expense of geometric precision. To bridge this gap, we introduce Brep2Shape, a novel self-supervised pre-training method designed to align abstract boundary representations with intuitive shape representations. Our method employs a geometry-aware task where the model learns to predict dense spatial points from parametric B\u00e9zier control points, enabling the network to better understand physical manifolds derived from abstract coefficients. To enhance this alignment, we propose a Dual Transformer backbone with parallel streams that independently encode surface and curve tokens to capture their distinct geometric properties. Moreover, the topology attention is integrated to model the interdependencies between surfaces and curves, thereby maintaining topological consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that Brep2Shape offers significant scalability, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and faster convergence across various downstream tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faBrep2Shape\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u5c06\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u8868\u793a\uff08B-rep\uff09\u4e0e\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u6d41Transformer\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u62d3\u6251\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u66f4\u5feb\u6536\u655b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406B-rep\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u8868\u793a\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff1a\u8fde\u7eed\u65b9\u6cd5\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\u4f46\u89c6\u89c9\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u79bb\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f4\u89c2\u4f46\u51e0\u4f55\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f4e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBrep2Shape\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4eceB\u00e9zier\u63a7\u5236\u70b9\u9884\u6d4b\u7a20\u5bc6\u7a7a\u95f4\u70b9\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b\u6784\u5efaDual Transformer\u4e3b\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u7f16\u7801\u66f2\u9762\u4e0e\u66f2\u7ebftoken\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u62d3\u6251\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e8c\u8005\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u62d3\u6251\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0SOTA\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u663e\u8457\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u66f4\u5feb\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "Brep2Shape\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u4e86B-rep\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u6027\u4e0e\u76f4\u89c2\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86CAD\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u62d3\u6251\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Bi-Adapt achieves cross-category affordance mapping by leveraging the strong capability of vision foundation models. Fine-tuning with restricted data on novel categories, Bi-Adapt exhibits notable generalization to out-of-category objects in a zero-shot manner. Extensive experiments conducted in both simulation and real-world environments validate the effectiveness of our approach and demonstrate its high efficiency, achieving a high success rate on different benchmark tasks across novel categories with limited data.

Across datasets from the United Kingdom and Singapore, this approach outperforms existing methods in predicting validated fusion scores. Applied to extremist manifestos, two distinct high-fusion pathways to violence emerge: ideologues tend to frame themselves in terms of group, forming kinship bonds; whereas grievance-driven individuals frame the group in terms of their personal identity.

Motivated by the efficiency and high-quality reconstruction ability of recent Gaussian Splatting (GS) techniques, we propose TOM-GS, a thermal odometry and mapping method that integrates learning-based odometry with GS-based dense mapping. TOM-GS is among the first GS-based SLAM systems tailored for thermal cameras, featuring dedicated thermal image enhancement and monocular depth integration. Extensive experiments on motion estimation and novel-view rendering demonstrate that TOM-GS outperforms existing learning-based methods, confirming the benefits of learning-based pipelines for robust thermal odometry and dense reconstruction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86TOM-GS\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u70ed\u6210\u50cf\u76f8\u673a\u7684\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u578bSLAM\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u5f0f\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u4e0e\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\uff08GS\uff09\u7a20\u5bc6\u5efa\u56fe\uff0c\u5728\u6076\u52a3\u73af\u5883\uff08\u5982\u70df\u96fe\u3001\u9ed1\u6697\uff09\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u51c6\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u6e32\u67d3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u70ed\u7ea2\u5916\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u4e0e\u5efa\u56fe\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u51e0\u4f55\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5dee\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7a20\u5bc6\u5730\u56fe\uff1b\u800c\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\uff08GS\uff09\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u6545\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u5c06\u5176\u5f15\u5165\u70ed\u7ea2\u5916SLAM\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTOM-GS\uff1a\u878d\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u5f0f\u5355\u76ee\u70ed\u7ea2\u5916\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u4e0eGS\u7a20\u5bc6\u5efa\u56fe\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e13\u7528\u70ed\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u70ed\u76f8\u673a\u7684GS-SLAM\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u6e32\u67d3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cTOM-GS\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u70edSLAM\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u5728\u70ed\u7ea2\u5916\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u91cd\u5efa\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "TOM-GS\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5c06\u5b66\u4e60\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u4e0eGS\u5efa\u56fe\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u70ed\u7ea2\u5916SLAM\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u7a20\u5bc6\u91cd\u5efa\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6076\u52a3\u73af\u5883\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

In this paper, we implement and evaluate various state-of-the-art acquisition functions, analyzing their accuracy and computational costs, while discussing the advantages and disadvantages of each method. Our findings reveal that representativity-based acquisition functions effectively explore the dataset but do not prioritize boundary decisions, whereas uncertainty-based acquisition functions focus on refining boundary decisions already identified by the neural network. This trade-off is known as the exploration-exploitation dilemma. To address this dilemma, we introduce six aggregation structures: series, parallel, hybrid, adaptive feedback, random exploration, and annealing exploration. Our aggregated acquisition functions alleviate common AL pathologies such as batch mode inefficiency and the cold start problem. Additionally, we focus on balancing accuracy and energy consumption, contributing to the development of more sustainable, energy-aware artificial intelligence (AI). We evaluate our proposed structures on various models and datasets. Our results demonstrate the potential of these structures to reduce computational costs while maintaining or even improving accuracy. Innovative aggregation approaches, such as alternating between acquisition functions such as BALD and BADGE, have shown robust results.

While large vision-language models (VLMs) trained on web-scale data offer powerful common-sense reasoning, they lack the grounded experience necessary for safe vehicle control. We posit that an effective autonomous agent should leverage the world knowledge of VLMs to guide a steerable driving policy toward robust control in driving scenarios. To this end, we propose SteerVLA, which leverages the reasoning capabilities of VLMs to produce fine-grained language instructions that steer a vision-language-action (VLA) driving policy. Key to our method is this rich language interface between the high-level VLM and low-level VLA, which allows the high-level policy to more effectively ground its reasoning in the control outputs of the low-level policy. To provide fine-grained language supervision aligned with vehicle control, we leverage a VLM to augment existing driving data with detailed language annotations, which we find to be essential for effective reasoning and steerability. We evaluate SteerVLA on a challenging closed-loop benchmark, where it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 4.77 points in overall driving score and by 8.04 points on a long-tail subset.

At the heart of this process is not just the ability to communicate but also the remarkable flexibility in how we can express ourselves. We can express the same thoughts in virtually infinite ways using different words and structures - this ability to rephrase and reformulate expressions is known as paraphrase. Modeling paraphrases is a keystone to meaning in computational language models; being able to construct different variations of texts that convey the same meaning or not shows strong abilities of semantic understanding. If computational language models are to represent meaning, they must understand and control the different aspects that construct the same meaning as opposed to different meanings at a fine granularity. Yet most existing approaches reduce paraphrasing to a binary decision between two texts or to producing a single rewrite of a source, obscuring which linguistic factors are responsible for meaning preservation. In this thesis, I propose that decomposing paraphrases into their constituent linguistic aspects (paraphrase types) offers a more fine-grained and cognitively grounded view of semantic equivalence. I show that even advanced machine learning models struggle with this task. Yet, when explicitly trained on paraphrase types, models achieve stronger performance on related paraphrase tasks and downstream applications. For example, in plagiarism detection, language models trained on paraphrase types surpass human baselines: 89.6% accuracy compared to 78.4% for plagiarism cases from Wikipedia, and 66.5% compared to 55.7% for plagiarism of scientific papers from arXiv. In identifying duplicate questions on Quora, models trained with paraphrase types improve over models trained on binary pairs.

However, the degree to which brain signals truly encode visual information remains unclear. Current visual decoding approaches explore various brain-image alignment strategies, yet most emphasize high-level semantic features while neglecting pixel-level details, thereby limiting our understanding of the human visual system. In this paper, we propose a brain-image alignment strategy that leverages multiple pre-trained visual encoders with distinct inductive biases to capture hierarchical and multi-scale visual representations, while employing a contrastive learning objective to achieve effective alignment between brain signals and visual embeddings. Furthermore, we introduce a Fusion Prior, which learns a stable mapping on large-scale visual data and subsequently matches brain features to this pre-trained prior, thereby enhancing distributional consistency across modalities.

AI models for biology are trained on large volumes of data, including data related to biological sequences, structures, images, and functions. The type of data used to train a model is intimately tied to the capabilities it ultimately possesses--including those of biosecurity concern. For this reason, an international group of more than 100 researchers at the recent 50th anniversary Asilomar Conference endorsed data controls to prevent the use of AI for harmful applications such as bioweapons development. To help design such controls, we introduce a five-tier Biosecurity Data Level (BDL) framework for categorizing pathogen data.

A popular and promising approach is to regularize actor-critic methods with behavior cloning (BC), which yields realistic policies and mitigates bias from out-of-distribution actions, but can impose an often-overlooked performance ceiling: when dataset actions are suboptimal, indiscriminate imitation structurally prevents the actor from fully exploiting high-value regions suggested by the critic, especially in later training when imitation is already dominant. We formally analyzed this limitation by investigating convergence properties of BC-regularized actor-critic optimization and verified it on a controlled continuous bandit task. To break this ceiling, we propose proximal action replacement (PAR), a plug-and-play training sample replacer that progressively replaces low-value actions with high-value actions generated by a stable actor, broadening the action exploration space while reducing the impact of low-value data. PAR is compatible with multiple BC regularization paradigms. Extensive experiments across offline RL benchmarks show that PAR consistently improves performance and approaches state-of-the-art when combined with the basic TD3+BC.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a proximal action replacement (PAR) \u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\uff08BC\uff09\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u9650\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9010\u6b65\u66ff\u6362\u4f4e\u4ef7\u503c\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u4ef7\u503c\u52a8\u4f5c\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "BC\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u52a8\u4f5c\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u52a8\u4f5c\u672c\u8eab\u6b21\u4f18\u65f6\uff0c\u76f2\u76ee\u6a21\u4eff\u4f1a\u9650\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u63a2\u7d22\u9ad8\u4ef7\u503c\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u5929\u82b1\u677f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faproximal action replacement (PAR)\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u66ff\u6362\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u7528\u7a33\u5b9aactor\u751f\u6210\u7684\u9ad8\u4ef7\u503c\u52a8\u4f5c\u66ff\u6362\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u4f4e\u4ef7\u503c\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u52a8\u4f5c\u63a2\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "PAR\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4e00\u81f4\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eTD3+BC\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u63a5\u8fd1\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "PAR\u6709\u6548\u7a81\u7834\u4e86BC\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u3001\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u5f3a\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u6539\u8fdb\u6280\u672f\u3002"}}

The formulation explicitly accounts for time-varying longitudinal velocity in the lateral-yaw dynamics and retains nonlinear steering-coupled interaction terms that are commonly simplified in the literature. Unlike approaches that assume constant longitudinal speed, the proposed design targets the transient post-impact regime where speed variations and nonlinear coupling significantly influence recovery.

A Probabilistic Perspective on the Emergence of Reasoning in RLVR", "comment": "15 pages", "summary": "Whether Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) endows Large Language Models (LLMs) with new capabilities or merely elicits latent traces remains a central debate. In this work, we align with the former view, proposing a probabilistic framework where capability is defined by instance-level solvability. We hypothesize that the emergence of complex reasoning can be driven by sharpening atomic step probabilities, which enables models to overcome the exponential decay of success rates inherent in multi-step reasoning chains. Utilizing the Algebrarium framework, we train models exclusively on single-step operations and evaluate their performance on unseen multi-step tasks. Our empirical results confirm that: (1) RLVR incentivizes the exploration of previously inaccessible solution paths by amplifying the model's existing skills; (2) composite performance is strictly governed by the joint probability of atomic steps, evidenced by high Pearson correlation coefficients ($\u03c1\\in [0.69, 0.96]$); and (3) RLVR, acting as a global optimizer, can cause specific skills to be sacrificed to maximize aggregate reward. Our work offers a novel explanation for emergent abilities in RLVR, suggesting that the iterative optimization of solvable problems enables models to develop the capabilities to tackle previously unsolvable scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6982\u7387\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u53ef\u89e3\u6027\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\uff08RLVR\uff09\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u5347\u539f\u5b50\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u6210\u529f\u6982\u7387\u6765\u9a71\u52a8\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7Algebrarium\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86RLVR\u5982\u4f55\u653e\u5927\u5df2\u6709\u6280\u80fd\u3001\u9075\u5faa\u8054\u5408\u6982\u7387\u89c4\u5f8b\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u727a\u7272\u5c40\u90e8\u6280\u80fd\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u5168\u5c40\u5956\u52b1\u3002", "motivation": "\u6f84\u6e05RLVR\u662f\u8d4b\u4e88LLM\u65b0\u80fd\u529b\u8fd8\u662f\u4ec5\u6fc0\u53d1\u6f5c\u5728\u80fd\u529b\u8fd9\u4e00\u6838\u5fc3\u4e89\u8bae\uff1b\u63a2\u7a76\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6d8c\u73b0\u7684\u5185\u5728\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u53ef\u89e3\u6027\u7684\u6982\u7387\u80fd\u529b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6e90\u4e8e\u539f\u5b50\u6b65\u9aa4\u6210\u529f\u6982\u7387\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u5728Algebrarium\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u4ec5\u7528\u5355\u6b65\u64cd\u4f5c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u591a\u6b65\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6790\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u89c2\u5bdf\u68c0\u9a8c\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "result": "\uff081\uff09RLVR\u80fd\u6fc0\u52b1\u63a2\u7d22\u539f\u5148\u4e0d\u53ef\u8fbe\u7684\u89e3\u8def\u5f84\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u591a\u6b65\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u4e25\u683c\u7531\u5404\u539f\u5b50\u6b65\u9aa4\u6210\u529f\u6982\u7387\u7684\u8054\u5408\u51b3\u5b9a\uff08Pearson\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u65700.69\u20130.96\uff09\uff1b\uff083\uff09RLVR\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5168\u5c40\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u7279\u5b9a\u6280\u80fd\u88ab\u727a\u7272\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6574\u4f53\u5956\u52b1\u3002", "conclusion": "RLVR\u5e76\u975e\u4ec5\u63ed\u793a\u9690\u542b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u53ef\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u771f\u6b63\u53d1\u5c55\u51fa\u89e3\u51b3\u5148\u524d\u4e0d\u53ef\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b0\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u80fd\u529b\u6d8c\u73b0\u672c\u8d28\u662f\u539f\u5b50\u6b65\u9aa4\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7a81\u7834\u3002"}}

Implicit methods, on the other hand, capture high-level implicit motion semantics directly from the driving video, but suffer from identity leakage and entanglement between motion and appearance. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel implicit motion representation that compresses per-frame motion into compact 1D motion tokens. This design relaxes strict spatial constraints inherent in 2D representations and effectively prevents identity information leakage from the motion video. Furthermore, we design a temporally consistent mask token-based retargeting module that enforces a temporal training bottleneck, mitigating interference from the source images' motion and improving retargeting consistency. Our methodology employs a three-stage training strategy to enhance the training efficiency and ensure high fidelity.

In this paper, we identify this assumption as Dogma 4 of Reinforcement Learning (RL). We demonstrate that while this dogma holds in static environments, it fails in social settings where evaluators may be sycophantic, lazy, or adversarial. We prove that under Dogma 4, standard RL agents suffer from what we call Objective Decoupling, a structural failure mode where the agent's learned objective permanently separates from the latent ground truth, guaranteeing convergence to misalignment. To resolve this, we propose Epistemic Source Alignment (ESA). Unlike standard robust methods that rely on statistical consensus (trusting the majority), ESA utilizes sparse safety axioms to judge the source of the feedback rather than the signal itself. We prove that this \"judging the judges\" mechanism guarantees convergence to the true objective, even when a majority of evaluators are biased.

Tayal", "S. Akshay"], "title": "Data-Aware and Scalable Sensitivity Analysis for Decision Tree Ensembles", "comment": null, "summary": "Decision tree ensembles are widely used in critical domains, making robustness and sensitivity analysis essential to their trustworthiness. We study the feature sensitivity problem, which asks whether an ensemble is sensitive to a specified subset of features -- such as protected attributes -- whose manipulation can alter model predictions. Existing approaches often yield examples of sensitivity that lie far from the training distribution, limiting their interpretability and practical value. We propose a data-aware sensitivity framework that constrains the sensitive examples to remain close to the dataset, thereby producing realistic and interpretable evidence of model weaknesses. To this end, we develop novel techniques for data-aware search using a combination of mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) encodings. Our contributions are fourfold. First, we strengthen the NP-hardness result for sensitivity verification, showing it holds even for trees of depth 1. Second, we develop MILP-optimizations that significantly speed up sensitivity verification for single ensembles and for the first time can also handle multiclass tree ensembles.

In this paper, we propose an entity and relation extraction algorithm based on hypergraph neural network (Legal-KAHRE) for drug-related judgment documents. Firstly, we design a candidate span generator based on neighbor-oriented packing strategy and biaffine mechanism, which identifies spans likely to contain entities. Secondly, we construct a legal dictionary with judicial domain knowledge and integrate it into text encoding representation using multi-head attention. Additionally, we incorporate domain-specific cases like joint crimes and combined punishment for multiple crimes into the hypergraph structure design.

In this work, a simple and efficient adaptive zoom-in framework is explored for object detection on UAV images. The main motivation is that the foreground objects are generally smaller and sparser than those in common scene images, which hinders the optimization of effective object detectors. We thus aim to zoom in adaptively on the objects to better capture object features for the detection task. To achieve the goal, two core designs are required: \\textcolor{black}{i) How to conduct non-uniform zooming on each image efficiently? ii) How to enable object detection training and inference with the zoomed image space?} Correspondingly, a lightweight offset prediction scheme coupled with a novel box-based zooming objective is introduced to learn non-uniform zooming on the input image. Based on the learned zooming transformation, a corner-aligned bounding box transformation method is proposed. The method warps the ground-truth bounding boxes to the zoomed space to learn object detection, and warps the predicted bounding boxes back to the original space during inference. We conduct extensive experiments on three representative UAV object detection datasets, including VisDrone, UAVDT, and SeaDronesSee. The proposed ZoomDet is architecture-independent and can be applied to an arbitrary object detection architecture. Remarkably, on the SeaDronesSee dataset, ZoomDet offers more than 8.4 absolute gain of mAP with a Faster R-CNN model, with only about 3 ms additional latency.

However, conventional practices rely on random sequences of fixed length, overlooking the variable-length nature of LLM inputs. Input length directly influences the activation distribution and, consequently, the weight importance captured by the Hessian, which in turn affects quantization outcomes. As a result, Hessian estimates derived from fixed-length calibration may fail to represent the true importance of weights across diverse input scenarios. We propose MaCa (Matryoshka Calibration), a simple yet effective method for length-aware Hessian construction. MaCa (i) incorporates multi-scale sequence length information into Hessian estimation and (ii) regularizes each sequence as an independent sample, yielding a more stable and fruitful Hessian for accurate quantization. Experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., Qwen3, Gemma3, LLaMA3) demonstrate that MaCa consistently improves accuracy under low bit quantization, offering a lightweight enhancement compatible with existing PTQ frameworks.

While recent advances in pose estimation have significantly improved numerical accuracy, practical robotic systems still suffer from frequent execution failures even when pose estimates appear accurate. This gap suggests that pose accuracy alone is insufficient to guarantee execution-level reliability. In this paper, we reveal that such failures arise from a deterministic geometric error amplification mechanism, in which small pose estimation errors are magnified through system structure and motion execution, leading to unstable or failed alignment. Rather than modifying pose estimation algorithms, we propose a Reliability-aware Execution Gating mechanism that operates at the execution level. The proposed approach evaluates geometric consistency and configuration risk before execution, and selectively rejects or scales high-risk pose updates. We validate the proposed method on a real UR5 robotic platform performing single-step visual alignment tasks under varying camera-target distances and off-axis configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed execution gating significantly improves task success rates, reduces execution variance, and suppresses tail-risk behavior, while leaving average pose accuracy largely unchanged. Importantly, the proposed mechanism is estimator-agnostic and can be readily integrated with both classical geometry-based and learning-based pose estimation pipelines. These results highlight the importance of execution-level reliability modeling and provide a practical solution for improving robustness in near-field vision-guided robotic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u5f15\u5bfc\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u8fd1\u573a\u548c\u79bb\u8f74\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u6267\u884c\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u2014\u2014\u51e0\u4f55\u8bef\u5dee\u653e\u5927\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6267\u884c\u7ea7\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5df2\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u770b\u4f3c\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u9891\u7e41\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4ec5\u9760\u59ff\u6001\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6267\u884c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6267\u884c\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\uff08Reliability-aware Execution Gating\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u6267\u884c\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6784\u578b\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u62d2\u7edd\u6216\u7f29\u653e\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u59ff\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5177\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728UR5\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u6267\u884c\u65b9\u5dee\u3001\u6291\u5236\u5c3e\u90e8\u98ce\u9669\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5e73\u5747\u59ff\u6001\u7cbe\u5ea6\u57fa\u672c\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6267\u884c\u7ea7\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u5bf9\u8fd1\u573a\u89c6\u89c9\u5f15\u5bfc\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff1b\u6240\u63d0\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236 estimator-agnostic\u3001\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

We present a unified theoretical framework for analyzing the effect of arbitrary contextual information in Transformer-based LLMs. Our analysis characterizes contextual influence through output error dynamics. In a single-layer Transformer, we prove that the context-conditioned error vector decomposes additively into the baseline error vector and a contextual correction vector. This yields necessary geometric conditions for error reduction: the contextual correction must align with the negative baseline error and satisfy a norm constraint. We further show that the contextual correction norm admits an explicit upper bound determined by context-query relevance and complementarity. These results extend to multi-context and multi-layer Transformers. Experiments across ICL, retrieval-augmented generation, and memory evolution validate our theory and motivate a principled context selection strategy that improves performance by $0.6\\%$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u793a\u4f8b\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u77e5\u8bc6\u6216\u4ea4\u4e92\u5386\u53f2\uff09\u5bf9Transformer\u7c7b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u8bef\u5dee\u52a8\u6001\u4fee\u6b63\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u8bef\u5dee\u51cf\u5c0f\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\u53ca\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u539f\u5219\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u4e0d\u66f4\u65b0\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\u5728\u9664\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ICL\uff09\u5916\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4ecd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f93\u51fa\u8bef\u5dee\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u5c42Transformer\u4e2d\u8bc1\u660e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fee\u6b63\u8bef\u5dee\u5411\u91cf\u53ef\u52a0\u6027\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u5176\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u8bef\u5dee\u5bf9\u9f50\u53ca\u8303\u6570\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587-\u67e5\u8be2\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4e0e\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u51b3\u5b9a\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u5411\u91cf\u8303\u6570\u4e0a\u754c\uff1b\u5c06\u7ed3\u8bba\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u591a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0e\u591a\u5c42Transformer\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u672c\u8d28\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728ICL\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6f14\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u539f\u5219\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f7f\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u53470.6%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u8bef\u5dee\u4fee\u6b63\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6027\u8d28\u7edf\u4e00\u523b\u753b\uff0c\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u65b9\u5411\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u8303\u6570\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u4f18\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5229\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, existing systems often face limitations in both accuracy and the ability to recognize small targets. In this study, we propose a bionic stabilized localization system based on CA-YOLO, designed to enhance both target localization accuracy and small target recognition capabilities. Acting as the \"brain\" of the system, the target detection algorithm emulates the visual focusing mechanism of animals by integrating bionic modules into the YOLO backbone network. These modules include the introduction of a small target detection head and the development of a Characteristic Fusion Attention Mechanism (CFAM). Furthermore, drawing inspiration from the human Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex (VOR), a bionic pan-tilt tracking control strategy is developed, which incorporates central positioning, stability optimization, adaptive control coefficient adjustment, and an intelligent recapture function. The experimental results show that CA-YOLO outperforms the original model on standard datasets (COCO and VisDrone), with average accuracy metrics improved by 3.94%and 4.90%, respectively.Further time-sensitive target localization experiments validate the effectiveness and practicality of this bionic stabilized localization system.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eCA-YOLO\u7684\u4eff\u751f\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u5934\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff08CFAM\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u76ee\u6807\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u53d7\u524d\u5ead\u773c\u53cd\u5c04\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u4e91\u53f0\u8ddf\u8e2a\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86COCO\u548cVisDrone\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u73b0\u4ee3\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5728YOLO\u4e3b\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210\u4eff\u751f\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u5305\u62ec\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u5934\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff08CFAM\uff09\uff1b\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u524d\u5ead\u773c\u53cd\u5c04\uff08VOR\uff09\u539f\u7406\u7684\u4eff\u751f\u4e91\u53f0\u8ddf\u8e2a\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u542b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u6570\u8c03\u6574\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u91cd\u6355\u83b7\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "result": "CA-YOLO\u5728COCO\u548cVisDrone\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u53473.94%\u548c4.90%\uff1b\u65f6\u654f\u76ee\u6807\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u4eff\u751f\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u76ee\u6807\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) targets these mechanisms but faces scalability challenges. Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) offers potential for delivering personalized DBT coaching at scale, yet rapid development has outpaced safety infrastructure. Methods: We developed Glow, a GenAI-powered DBT skills coach delivering chain and solution analysis for individuals at risk for HIV and substance use. In partnership with a Los Angeles community health organization, we conducted usability testing with clinical staff (n=6) and individuals with lived experience (n=28). Using the Helpful, Honest, and Harmless (HHH) framework, we employed user-driven adversarial testing wherein participants identified target behaviors and generated contextually realistic risk probes. We evaluated safety performance across 37 risk probe interactions. Results: Glow appropriately handled 73% of risk probes, but performance varied by agent. The solution analysis agent demonstrated 90% appropriate handling versus 44% for the chain analysis agent. Safety failures clustered around encouraging substance use and normalizing harmful behaviors. The chain analysis agent fell into an \"empathy trap,\" providing validation that reinforced maladaptive beliefs. Additionally, 27 instances of DBT skill misinformation were identified. Conclusions: This study provides the first systematic safety evaluation of GenAI-delivered DBT coaching for HIV and substance use risk reduction. Findings reveal vulnerabilities requiring mitigation before clinical trials. The HHH framework and user-driven adversarial testing offer replicable methods for evaluating GenAI mental health interventions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u540d\u4e3aGlow\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684DBT\u6280\u80fd\u6559\u7ec3\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eHIV\u548c\u7269\u8d28\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u5371\u4eba\u7fa4\u7684\u94fe\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7HHH\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u7528\u6237\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5bf9\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u529f\u80fd\u6a21\u5757\u4e2d\u5b89\u5168\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u9f13\u52b1\u7269\u8d28\u4f7f\u7528\u3001\u5f3a\u5316\u4e0d\u826f\u4fe1\u5ff5\u53caDBT\u6280\u80fd\u9519\u8bef\u7b49\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "HIV\u4e0e\u7269\u8d28\u4f7f\u7528\u662f\u5177\u6709\u5171\u540c\u5fc3\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\uff08\u51b2\u52a8\u6027\u4e0e\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u826f\u5e94\u5bf9\uff09\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\uff1bDBT\u53ef\u9776\u5411\u5e72\u9884\u8fd9\u4e9b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff1bGenAI\u867d\u6709\u671b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u3001\u89c4\u6a21\u5316DBT\u8f85\u5bfc\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u5df2\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1Glow\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eGenAI\u7684DBT\u6280\u80fd\u6559\u7ec3\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u94fe\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u8054\u5408\u6d1b\u6749\u77f6\u793e\u533a\u5065\u5eb7\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5f00\u5c55\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08\u4e34\u5e8a\u4eba\u5458n=6\uff0c\u4eb2\u5386\u8005n=28\uff09\uff1b\u91c7\u7528HHH\uff08\u6709\u76ca\u3001\u8bda\u5b9e\u3001\u65e0\u5bb3\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u65bd\u7528\u6237\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u751f\u621037\u4e2a\u60c5\u5883\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u63a2\u9488\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b89\u5168\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "result": "Glow\u5bf973%\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u63a2\u9488\u5904\u7406\u6070\u5f53\uff0c\u4f46\u5404\u4ee3\u7406\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff1a\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5206\u6790\u4ee3\u7406\u8fbe90%\uff0c\u94fe\u5206\u6790\u4ee3\u7406\u4ec544%\uff1b\u5b89\u5168\u5931\u6548\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u9f13\u52b1\u7269\u8d28\u4f7f\u7528\u3001\u5408\u7406\u5316\u6709\u5bb3\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\u94fe\u5206\u6790\u4ee3\u7406\u9677\u5165\u201c\u5171\u60c5\u9677\u9631\u201d\uff0c\u8fc7\u5ea6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u800c\u5f3a\u5316\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u826f\u4fe1\u5ff5\uff1b\u5171\u53d1\u73b027\u4f8bDBT\u6280\u80fd\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9GenAI\u8f85\u52a9DBT\u5e72\u9884HIV/\u7269\u8d28\u4f7f\u7528\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u7ed3\u679c\u63ed\u793a\u5173\u952e\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u987b\u5728\u8fdb\u5165\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u524d\u52a0\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\uff1bHHH\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u9a71\u52a8\u5bf9\u6297\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e3aGenAI\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u5e72\u9884\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This is particularly harmful in modern applications such as learning-enhanced platform operations and post-bandit statistical inference. Thus motivated, we introduce a new performance metric of MAB algorithms termed allocation variability, which is the largest (over arms) standard deviation of an arm's number of pulls. We establish a fundamental trade-off between allocation variability and regret, the canonical performance metric of reward maximization. In particular, for any algorithm, the worst-case regret $R_T$ and worst-case allocation variability $S_T$ must satisfy $R_T \\cdot S_T=\u03a9(T^{\\frac{3}{2}})$ as $T\\rightarrow\\infty$, as long as $R_T=o(T)$. This indicates that any minimax regret-optimal algorithm must incur worst-case allocation variability $\u0398(T)$, the largest possible scale; while any algorithm with sublinear worst-case regret must necessarily incur ${S}_T= \u03c9(\\sqrt{T})$. We further show that this lower bound is essentially tight, and that any point on the Pareto frontier $R_T \\cdot S_T=\\tilde\u0398(T^{3/2})$ can be achieved by a simple tunable algorithm UCB-f, a generalization of the classic UCB1. Finally, we discuss implications for platform operations and for statistical inference, when bandit algorithms are used.

Therefore, this study categorizes and analyzes the characteristics of muscles, as well as their management and utilization methods, based on the various research conducted on the musculoskeletal humanoids we have developed, Kengoro and Musashi. We classify the features of the musculoskeletal structure into five properties: Redundancy, Independency, Anisotropy, Variable Moment Arm, and Nonlinear Elasticity. We then organize the diverse advantages and disadvantages of musculoskeletal humanoids that arise from the combination of these properties. In particular, we discuss body schema learning and reflex control, along with muscle grouping and body schema adaptation. Also, we describe the implementation of movements through an integrated system and discuss future challenges and prospects.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u808c\u9aa8\u9abc\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff08\u5982Kengoro\u548cMusashi\uff09\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0e\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e94\u5927\u56fa\u6709\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u5197\u4f59\u6027\u3001\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u3001\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u53d8\u529b\u81c2\u3001\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5f39\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u5728\u672c\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u53cd\u5c04\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u808c\u8089\u5206\u7ec4\u53ca\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4e0e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u808c\u9aa8\u9abc\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u7ed3\u6784\u56fa\u6709\u7279\u6027\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5f52\u7eb3\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u8054\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u4e3b\u7814\u53d1\u7684Kengoro\u4e0eMusashi\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u5bf9\u808c\u9aa8\u9abc\u7ed3\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u5f52\u7eb3\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u70bc\u51fa\u4e94\u7c7b\u6838\u5fc3\u7269\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u672c\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u53cd\u5c04\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u808c\u8089\u5206\u7ec4\u7b49\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u808c\u9aa8\u9abc\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4e94\u5927\u5c5e\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u7ec4\u5408\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0e\u5c40\u9650\uff1b\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5c5e\u6027\u2014\u63a7\u5236\u529f\u80fd\u6620\u5c04\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u96c6\u6210\u5316\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u82e5\u5e72\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u808c\u9aa8\u9abc\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u4e8e\u4eff\u751f\u5f62\u6001\uff0c\u66f4\u5728\u4e8e\u5176\u591a\u7ef4\u7269\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u534f\u540c\u5229\u7528\uff1b\u672a\u6765\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u53d1\u5c55\u9762\u5411\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

As the conclusive written instrument issued by a court, a judgment document embodies complex legal reasoning. However, existing methods often oversimplify this complex process, particularly by omitting the ``Pre-Judge'' phase, a crucial step where human judges form a preliminary conclusion. This omission leads to two core challenges: 1) the ineffective acquisition of foundational judicial elements, and 2) the inadequate modeling of the Pre-Judge process, which collectively undermine the final document's legal soundness. To address these challenges, we propose \\textit{\\textbf{J}udicial \\textbf{U}nified \\textbf{S}ynthesis \\textbf{T}hrough \\textbf{I}ntermediate \\textbf{C}onclusion \\textbf{E}mulation} (JUSTICE), a novel framework that emulates the ``Search $\\rightarrow$ Pre-Judge $\\rightarrow$ Write'' cognitive workflow of human judges. Specifically, it introduces the Pre-Judge stage through three dedicated components: Referential Judicial Element Retriever (RJER), Intermediate Conclusion Emulator (ICE), and Judicial Unified Synthesizer (JUS). RJER first retrieves legal articles and a precedent case to establish a referential foundation. ICE then operationalizes the Pre-Judge phase by generating a verifiable intermediate conclusion. Finally, JUS synthesizes these inputs to craft the final judgment. Experiments on both an in-domain legal benchmark and an out-of-distribution dataset show that JUSTICE significantly outperforms strong baselines, with substantial gains in legal accuracy, including a 4.6\\% improvement in prison term prediction. Our findings underscore the importance of explicitly modeling the Pre-Judge process to enhance the legal coherence and accuracy of generated judgment documents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faJUSTICE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u6cd5\u5b98'\u68c0\u7d22\u2192\u9884\u5224\u2192\u64b0\u5199'\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f15\u5165\u9884\u5224\u9636\u6bb5\uff08Pre-Judge\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5224\u51b3\u4e66\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u6cd5\u5b98\u5f62\u6210\u521d\u6b65\u7ed3\u8bba\u7684'\u9884\u5224'\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u53f8\u6cd5\u8981\u7d20\u83b7\u53d6\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u9884\u5224\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u5145\u5206\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5224\u51b3\u4e66\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faJUSTICE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u53c2\u8003\u6027\u53f8\u6cd5\u8981\u7d20\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\uff08RJER\uff09\u3001\u4e2d\u95f4\u7ed3\u8bba\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff08ICE\uff09\u548c\u53f8\u6cd5\u7edf\u4e00\u5408\u6210\u5668\uff08JUS\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4f9d\u636e\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u95f4\u7ed3\u8bba\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u5224\u51b3\u5408\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9886\u57df\u5185\u6cd5\u5f8b\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u76d1\u72f1\u5211\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53474.6%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u9884\u5224\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u5224\u51b3\u4e66\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

We identify two limitations in existing benchmarks: (1) They provide limited insights on the representation usefulness of OCL models, and (2) localization and representation usefulness are assessed using disjoint metrics. To address (1), we use instruction-tuned VLMs as evaluators, enabling scalable benchmarking across diverse VQA datasets to measure how well VLMs leverage OCL representations for complex reasoning tasks. To address (2), we introduce a unified evaluation task and metric that jointly assess localization (where) and representation usefulness (what), thereby eliminating inconsistencies introduced by disjoint evaluation.

Such explicit reasoning requires extended context lengths, resulting in substantially higher resource consumption. Prior work has shown that adversarially crafted inputs can trigger redundant reasoning processes, exposing LRMs to resource-exhaustion vulnerabilities. However, the reasoning process itself, especially its reflective component, has received limited attention, even though it can lead to over-reflection and consume excessive computing power. In this paper, we introduce Recursive Entropy to quantify the risk of resource consumption in reflection, thereby revealing the safety issues inherent in inference itself. Based on Recursive Entropy, we introduce RECUR, a resource exhaustion attack via Recursive Entropy guided Counterfactual Utilization and Reflection. It constructs counterfactual questions to verify the inherent flaws and risks of LRMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, under benign inference, recursive entropy exhibits a pronounced decreasing trend.

Transformers, as powerful foundational models, have been applied to scRNA-seq clustering. Their self-attention mechanism automatically assigns higher attention weights to cells within the same cluster, enhancing the distinction between clusters. Existing methods for scRNA-seq clustering, such as graph transformer-based models, treat each cell as a token in a sequence. Their computational and space complexities are $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ with respect to the number of cells, limiting their applicability to large-scale scRNA-seq datasets.To address this challenge, we propose a Bipartite Graph Transformer-based clustering model (BGFormer) for scRNA-seq data. We introduce a set of learnable anchor tokens as shared reference points to represent the entire dataset. A bipartite graph attention mechanism is introduced to learn the similarity between cells and anchor tokens, bringing cells of the same class closer together in the embedding space. BGFormer achieves linear computational complexity with respect to the number of cells, making it scalable to large datasets.

Existing work like UniDomain effectively learns symbolic manipulation domains from real-world demonstrations, described in Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), and has successfully applied them to real-world tasks. These domains, however, are restricted to tabletop manipulation. We propose UniPlan, a vision-language task planning system for long-horizon mobile-manipulation in large-scale indoor environments, that unifies scene topology, visuals, and robot capabilities into a holistic PDDL representation. UniPlan programmatically extends learned tabletop domains from UniDomain to support navigation, door traversal, and bimanual coordination. It operates on a visual-topological map, comprising navigation landmarks anchored with scene images. Given a language instruction, UniPlan retrieves task-relevant nodes from the map and uses a VLM to ground the anchored image into task-relevant objects and their PDDL states; next, it reconnects these nodes to a compressed, densely-connected topological map, also represented in PDDL, with connectivity and costs derived from the original map; Finally, a mobile-manipulation plan is generated using off-the-shelf PDDL solvers.

The bottleneck lies in the data construction and reward design for scientific post-training. We develop a large-scale, systematic data processing pipeline that transforms heterogeneous open-source science data into Dr. SCI dataset, which comprises of 1M questions across eight STEM subjects, with explicit verifiable/open-ended splits, scalable difficulty annotation, and fine-grained rubrics that operationalize evaluation for open-ended answers. Building on this dataset, we propose the Dr. SCI post-training pipeline, which redesigns the standard SFT -> RL workflow through three components: (i) Exploration-Expanding SFT, which broadens the model's reasoning pattern coverage prior to RL; (ii) Dynamic Difficulty Curriculum, which adapts training data to the model's evolving scientific capability; and (iii) SciRubric-Guided RL, which enables stable reinforcement learning on open-ended scientific questions via rubric-based evaluation with explicit answer correctness. Qwen3-4B-Base trained using Dr.SCI pipeline achieves 63.2 on GPQA-diamond and 32.4 on GPQA-general, consistently improves over strong post-trained baselines such as o1-mini and GPT-4o, demonstrating substantial gains in scientific reasoning, especially in open-ended settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDr. SCI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0e\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u7684SFT-RL\u8303\u5f0f\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u79d1\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u79d1\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u56e0\u76d1\u7763\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u96be\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b100\u4e07\u9053STEM\u9886\u57df\u9898\u76ee\u7684Dr. SCI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1/\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u5212\u5206\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u96be\u5ea6\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5Dr. SCI\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u63a2\u7d22\u6269\u5c55\u5f0f\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08Exploration-Expanding SFT\uff09\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u96be\u5ea6\u8bfe\u7a0b\uff08Dynamic Difficulty Curriculum\uff09\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eSciRubric\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08SciRubric-Guided RL\uff09\u3002", "result": "Qwen3-4B-Base\u7ecfDr. SCI\u6d41\u7a0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\uff0c\u5728GPQA-diamond\u548cGPQA-general\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u8fbe63.2\u548c32.4\u5206\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8ao1-mini\u3001GPT-4o\u7b49\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u9762\u5411\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u79d1\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66AI\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u3001\u53ef\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

In this paper, we present a deep learning-based approach for classifying cat breeds using a subset of the Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset, which contains high-resolution images of various domestic breeds. We employed the Global Context Vision Transformer (GCViT) architecture-tiny for cat breed recognition. To improve model generalization, we used extensive data augmentation, including rotation, horizontal flipping, and brightness adjustment. Experimental results show that the GCViT-Tiny model achieved a test accuracy of 92.00% and validation accuracy of 94.54%. These findings highlight the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures for fine-grained image classification tasks. Potential applications include veterinary diagnostics, animal shelter management, and mobile-based breed recognition systems.

Motivated by this observation, we propose WMSS (Weak Agents Can Make Strong Agents Stronger), a post-training paradigm that leverages weak checkpoints to guide continued optimization. By identifying recoverable learning gaps via entropy dynamics and reinforcing them through compensatory learning, WMSS enables strong agents to improve beyond conventional post-training saturation.

The aim of this work is to form a comprehensive understanding of groundwater salinization underlying causal factors and identify important meteorological, geological and anthropogenic drivers of salinity. We have integrated different datasets of potential covariates, to create a robust framework for machine learning based predictive models including Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, Neural network, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), convolution neural network (CNN) and linear regression (LR), of groundwater salinity. Additionally, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) followed by Global sensitivity analysis (GSA) and Explainable AI (XAI) based SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were used to estimate the importance scores and find insights into the drivers of salinization. We also did causality analysis via Double machine learning using various predictive models. From these analyses, key meteorological (Precipitation, Temperature), geological (Distance from river, Distance to saline body, TWI, Shoreline distance), and anthropogenic (Area of agriculture field, Treated Wastewater) covariates are identified to be influential drivers of groundwater salinity across Israel.

While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated its strength in such settings, it may struggle to sufficiently explore and discover complex manipulation strategies, especially in sparse-reward settings. Our approach is based on the idea of a lower-dimensional manifold of feasible, likely-visited states during such manipulation and to guide RL with a sampler from this manifold. We propose Sample-Guided RL, which uses model-based constraint solvers to efficiently sample feasible configurations (satisfying differentiable collision, contact, and force constraints) and leverage them to guide RL for universal (goal-conditioned) manipulation policies. We study using this data directly to bias state visitation, as well as using black-box optimization of open-loop trajectories between random configurations to impose a state bias and optionally add a behavior cloning loss. In a minimalistic double sphere manipulation setting, Sample-Guided RL discovers complex manipulation strategies and achieves high success rates in reaching any statically stable state. In a more challenging panda arm setting, our approach achieves a significant success rate over a near-zero baseline, and demonstrates a breadth of complex whole-body-contact manipulation strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSample-Guided RL\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u91c7\u6837\u53ef\u884c\u6784\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u901a\u7528\uff08\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6\uff09\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u64cd\u7eb5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u4e0b\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u96be\u4ee5\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u590d\u6742\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff1b\u800c\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u6ee1\u8db3\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f15\u5bfc\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSample-Guided RL\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7ea6\u675f\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff08\u6ee1\u8db3\u53ef\u5fae\u78b0\u649e\u3001\u63a5\u89e6\u4e0e\u529b\u7ea6\u675f\uff09\u91c7\u6837\u4f4e\u7ef4\u53ef\u884c\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u6b64\u504f\u7f6eRL\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u8bbf\u95ee\u5206\u5e03\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7ed3\u5408\u9ed1\u7bb1\u4f18\u5316\u751f\u6210\u5f00\u73af\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u65bd\u52a0\u72b6\u6001\u504f\u597d\u6216\u5f15\u5165\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u53cc\u7403\u7b80\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u53d1\u73b0\u590d\u6742\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u610f\u9759\u6001\u7a33\u5b9a\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u9ad8\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff1b\u5728\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684Panda\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u63a5\u8fd1\u96f6\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u5168\u8eab\u63a5\u89e6\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u4e0eRL\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u4e0e\u63a2\u7d22\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u3001\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Most existing methods focus on the single-intent SLU, where each utterance only has one intent. However, in real-world scenarios users usually express multiple intents in an utterance, which poses a challenge for existing dialogue systems and datasets. In this paper, we propose a generative framework to simultaneously address multiple intent detection and slot filling. In particular, an attention-over-attention decoder is proposed to handle the variable number of intents and the interference between the two sub-tasks by incorporating an inductive bias into the process of multi-task learning. Besides, we construct two new multi-intent SLU datasets based on single-intent utterances by taking advantage of the next sentence prediction (NSP) head of the BERT model.

However, single time-point segmentations fail to capture the biological heterogeneity and temporal evolution of stroke. We propose a bi-temporal analysis framework that characterizes ischemic tissue using statistical descriptors, radiomic texture features, and deep feature embeddings from two architectures (mJ-Net and nnU-Net). Bi-temporal refers to admission (T1) and post-treatment follow-up (T2). All features are extracted at T1 from CTP, with follow-up DWI aligned to ensure spatial correspondence. Manually delineated masks at T1 and T2 are intersected to construct six regions of interest (ROIs) encoding both initial tissue state and final outcome. Features were aggregated per region and analyzed in feature space. Evaluation on 18 patients with successful reperfusion demonstrated meaningful clustering of region-level representations. Regions classified as penumbra or healthy at T1 that ultimately recovered exhibited feature similarity to preserved brain tissue, whereas infarct-bound regions formed distinct groupings. Both baseline GLCM and deep embeddings showed a similar trend: penumbra regions exhibit features that are significantly different depending on final state, whereas this difference is not significant for core regions. Deep feature spaces, particularly mJ-Net, showed strong separation between salvageable and non-salvageable tissue, with a penumbra separation index that differed significantly from zero (Wilcoxon signed-rank test). These findings suggest that encoder-derived feature manifolds reflect underlying tissue phenotypes and state transitions, providing insight into imaging-based quantification of stroke evolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\uff08\u5165\u9662\u65f6CTP\u548c\u968f\u8bbf\u65f6DWI\uff09\u7684\u751f\u7269\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u878d\u5408\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u533a\u57df\u5212\u5206\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7f3a\u8840\u6027\u5352\u4e2d\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8868\u578b\u53ca\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u53d8\u7684\u5f71\u50cf\u5b66\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5355\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u5206\u5272\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u5352\u4e2d\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u523b\u753b\u7f3a\u8840\u6838\u5fc3\u4e0e\u534a\u6697\u5e26\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u53cc\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\uff08T1\uff1a\u5165\u9662CTP\uff1bT2\uff1a\u968f\u8bbfDWI\uff09\u914d\u51c6\u4e0eROI\u5212\u5206\u6846\u67b6\uff086\u7c7b\u533a\u57df\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6GLCM\u7eb9\u7406\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u7edf\u8ba1\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u53camJ-Net/nnU-Net\u6df1\u5ea6\u5d4c\u5165\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u805a\u7c7b\u4e0e\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u572818\u4f8b\u6210\u529f\u518d\u901a\u60a3\u8005\u4e2d\uff0c\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u5448\u73b0\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u533a\u57df\u805a\u7c7b\uff1b\u534a\u6697\u5e26\u533a\u57df\u6700\u7ec8\u8f6c\u5f52\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\uff08p<0.05\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u6838\u5fc3\u533a\u57df\u65e0\u6b64\u5dee\u5f02\uff1bmJ-Net\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u534a\u6697\u5e26\u5206\u79bb\u6307\u6570\u663e\u8457\u975e\u96f6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5bfc\u51fa\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6d41\u5f62\u53ef\u53cd\u6620\u5352\u4e2d\u7ec4\u7ec7\u771f\u5b9e\u8868\u578b\u4e0e\u72b6\u6001\u8dc3\u8fc1\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f71\u50cf\u7684\u5352\u4e2d\u6f14\u5316\u91cf\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Our empirical analysis reveals an alarming inconsistency in existing evaluations: the standard deviation across ten repeated runs of a single model on HumanEval (1.67) actually exceeds the performance gap among the top-10 models on the official leaderboard (0.91), rendering current rankings statistically precarious. To mitigate these instabilities, we propose a decentralized evaluation framework that enables hardware and parameter diversity through large-scale benchmarking across heterogeneous compute nodes. By leveraging the blockchain-based protocol, the framework incentivizes global contributors to act as independent validators, using a robust reward system to ensure evaluation integrity and discourage dishonest participation. This collective verification transforms evaluation from a \"centralized black box\" into a \"decentralized endorsement\" where multi-party consensus and diverse inference environments yield a more stable, representative metric. Experimental results demonstrate that the decentralized evaluation framework reduces the standard deviation across ten runs on the same model to 0.28. This significant improvement over conventional frameworks ensures higher statistical confidence in model rankings. We have completely implemented this platform and will soon release it to the community.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u7684\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524d\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u3001\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u504f\u5dee\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0fLLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u3001\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6ce2\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u53d1\u73b0\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u6b21\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5dee\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8fc7\u9876\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6392\u540d\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u7684\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5f02\u6784\u8ba1\u7b97\u8282\u70b9\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6fc0\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u9f13\u52b1\u5168\u7403\u8d21\u732e\u8005\u4f5c\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8005\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u65b9\u5171\u8bc6\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u540c\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u5728HumanEval\u4e0a\u5341\u6b21\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5dee\u4ece1.67\u964d\u81f30.28\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bc4\u4f30\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6392\u540d\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u5f53\u524dLLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c06\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f\u4ece\u2018\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u9ed1\u7bb1\u2019\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u2018\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u80cc\u4e66\u2019\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Tan"], "title": "ODELoRA: Training Low-Rank Adaptation by Solving Ordinary Differential Equations", "comment": "38 pages", "summary": "Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a widely adopted parameter-efficient fine-tuning method in deep transfer learning, due to its reduced number of trainable parameters and lower memory requirements enabled by Burer-Monteiro factorization on adaptation matrices. However, classical LoRA training methods treat the low-rank factor matrices individually and optimize them using standard gradient-based algorithms. Such decoupled optimization schemes are theoretically and empirically suboptimal, as they fail to fully exploit the intrinsic structure of the LoRA parameterization. In this work, we propose a novel continuous-time optimization dynamic for LoRA factor matrices in the form of an ordinary differential equation (ODE) that emulates the gradient flow of full fine-tuning on the balanced manifold. We term this approach ODELoRA. To faithfully track the trajectories of ODELoRA, we adopt well-established and theoretically grounded time-discretization schemes, including Euler and Runge--Kutta methods. Our framework provides a unified ODE-based perspective for understanding and designing LoRA training algorithms. We establish linear convergence of the proposed method under strongly convex objectives for certain discretization schemes under mild conditions, and further extend our analysis to the matrix sensing setting. Moreover, we show that ODELoRA achieves stable feature learning, a property that is crucial for training deep neural networks at different scales of problem dimensionality. Empirical results on matrix sensing tasks confirm the derived linear convergence behavior, and experiments on training physics-informed neural networks further demonstrate the superiority of ODELoRA over existing baselines, especially in the training stability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faODELoRA\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e38\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08ODE\uff09\u7684LoRA\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u6a21\u62df\u5168\u91cf\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u8026\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u6536\u655b\u6027\u4e0e\u77e9\u9635\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ecf\u5178LoRA\u5c06\u4f4e\u79e9\u56e0\u5b50\u77e9\u9635\u72ec\u7acb\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u5176\u5185\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e0a\u7684\u6b21\u4f18\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u62df\u5168\u91cf\u5fae\u8c03\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4ODE\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316LoRA\u56e0\u5b50\u77e9\u9635\uff1b\u91c7\u7528Euler\u548cRunge\u2013Kutta\u7b49\u53ef\u9760\u65f6\u5e8f\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u5f3a\u51f8\u76ee\u6807\u4e0b\u7279\u5b9a\u79bb\u6563\u683c\u5f0f\u5177\u6709\u7ebf\u6027\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u77e9\u9635\u611f\u77e5\u573a\u666f\uff1b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u77e9\u9635\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ODELoRA\u4e3aLoRA\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684ODE\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u9ad8\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

This has two key advantages. First, it captures the recurrent nature of CoT, but where the thought tokens are generated as input is processing. Second, since the thoughts are represented as tokens, they can be learned from natural language supervision, and using teacher-forcing, which is parallelizable. Empirically, Thinking States outperforms other latent reasoning methods on multiple reasoning tasks, narrowing the gap to CoT on math problems, and matching its performance on 2-Hop QA with improved latency.

However, global alignment is easily dominated by non-diagnostic information, while local alignment fails to integrate key diagnostic evidence. As a result, learning reliable diagnostic representations becomes difficult, which limits their applicability in medical scenarios with limited paired data. To address this issue, we propose an LLM-Guided Diagnostic Evidence Alignment method (LGDEA), which shifts the pretraining objective toward evidence-level alignment that is more consistent with the medical diagnostic process. Specifically, we leverage LLMs to extract key diagnostic evidence from radiology reports and construct a shared diagnostic evidence space, enabling evidence-aware cross-modal alignment and allowing LGDEA to effectively exploit abundant unpaired medical images and reports, thereby substantially alleviating the reliance on paired data. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves consistent and significant improvements on phrase grounding, image--text retrieval, and zero-shot classification, and even rivals pretraining methods that rely on substantial paired data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLGDEA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u62a5\u544a\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u5173\u952e\u8bca\u65ad\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u8bca\u65ad\u8bc1\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bc1\u636e\u7ea7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u9879\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709CLIP\u5f0f\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5168\u5c40\u6216\u5c40\u90e8\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4f46\u5168\u5c40\u5bf9\u9f50\u6613\u53d7\u975e\u8bca\u65ad\u4fe1\u606f\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5c40\u90e8\u5bf9\u9f50\u96be\u4ee5\u6574\u5408\u5173\u952e\u8bca\u65ad\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u7684\u533b\u7597\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u9760\u8bca\u65ad\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLLM-Guided Diagnostic Evidence Alignment\uff08LGDEA\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u62a5\u544a\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u5173\u952e\u8bca\u65ad\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5171\u4eab\u8bca\u65ad\u8bc1\u636e\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bc1\u636e\u7ea7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u5927\u91cf\u672a\u914d\u5bf9\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u62a5\u544a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u77ed\u8bed\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u56fe\u6587\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u53ef\u5ab2\u7f8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "LGDEA\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc1\u636e\u7ea7\u5bf9\u9f50\u66f4\u5951\u5408\u533b\u5b66\u8bca\u65ad\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u5bf9\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u533b\u7597\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u8bca\u65ad\u8868\u5f81\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer an energy-efficient alternative due to their event-driven nature; however, their integration with continuous Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) representations is fundamentally challenged by distribution mismatch, where high-dynamic-range embeddings degrade the information coding capacity of threshold-based neurons. To resolve this, we propose Prompt-Tuned Spiking Neural Networks (PTS-SNN), a parameter-efficient neuromorphic adaptation framework that aligns frozen SSL backbones with spiking dynamics. Specifically, we introduce a Temporal Shift Spiking Encoder to capture local temporal dependencies via parameter-free channel shifts, establishing a stable feature basis. To bridge the domain gap, we devise a Context-Aware Membrane Potential Calibration strategy. This mechanism leverages a Spiking Sparse Linear Attention module to aggregate global semantic context into learnable soft prompts, which dynamically regulate the bias voltages of Parametric Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (PLIF) neurons. This regulation effectively centers the heterogeneous input distribution within the responsive firing range, mitigating functional silence or saturation.

MOSAIC first learns a teleoperation-oriented general motion tracker via RL on a multi-source motion bank with adaptive resampling and rewards that emphasize world-frame motion consistency, which is critical for mobile teleoperation. To bridge the sim-to-real interface gap without sacrificing generality, MOSAIC then performs rapid residual adaptation: an interface-specific policy is trained using minimal interface-specific data, and then distilled into the general tracker through an additive residual module, outperforming naive fine-tuning or continual learning.

However, the actual effect of reasoning on visual synthesis remains unclear. We present UReason, a diagnostic benchmark for reasoning-driven image generation that evaluates whether reasoning can be faithfully executed in pixels. UReason contains 2,000 instances across five task families: Code, Arithmetic, Spatial, Attribute, and Text reasoning. To isolate the role of reasoning traces, we introduce an evaluation framework comparing direct generation, reasoning-guided generation, and de-contextualized generation which conditions only on the refined prompt. Across eight open-source unified models, we observe a consistent Reasoning Paradox: Reasoning traces generally improve performance over direct generation, yet retaining intermediate thoughts as conditioning context often hinders visual synthesis, and conditioning only on the refined prompt yields substantial gains. Our analysis suggests that the bottleneck lies in contextual interference rather than insufficient reasoning capacity. UReason provides a principled testbed for studying reasoning in unified models and motivates future methods that effectively integrate reasoning for visual generation while mitigating interference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faUReason\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u63a8\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\u75d5\u8ff9\u867d\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u4e2d\u95f4\u601d\u7ef4\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u53cd\u800c\u5e72\u6270\u89c6\u89c9\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u74f6\u9888\u5728\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5e72\u6270\u800c\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u5408\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524d\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u94fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b2000\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u3001\u8986\u76d6\u4e94\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u57fa\u51c6UReason\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u76f4\u63a5\u751f\u6210\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u548c\u53bb\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5316\u751f\u6210\u4e09\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u5206\u79bb\u63a8\u7406\u75d5\u8ff9\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516b\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u53d1\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u7684'\u63a8\u7406\u6096\u8bba'\uff1a\u63a8\u7406\u75d5\u8ff9\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u4fdd\u7559\u4e2d\u95f4\u601d\u7ef4\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u53cd\u800c\u963b\u788d\u751f\u6210\uff1b\u4ec5\u7528\u7cbe\u70bc\u63d0\u793a\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63a8\u7406\u74f6\u9888\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1bUReason\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u52a8\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6574\u5408\u3002"}}

Slot attention is a popular approach that represents individual objects as latent vectors, called slots. Current methods obtain these slot representations solely from the last layer of a pre-trained vision transformer (ViT), ignoring valuable, semantically rich information encoded across the other layers. To better utilize this latent semantic information, we introduce MUFASA, a lightweight plug-and-play framework for slot attention-based approaches to unsupervised object segmentation. Our model computes slot attention across multiple feature layers of the ViT encoder, fully leveraging their semantic richness. We propose a fusion strategy to aggregate slots obtained on multiple layers into a unified object-centric representation. Integrating MUFASA into existing OCL methods improves their segmentation results across multiple datasets, setting a new state of the art while simultaneously improving training convergence with only minor inference overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMUFASA\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728ViT\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u5c42\u4e0a\u6267\u884cslot attention\u5e76\u878d\u5408\u591a\u5c42slots\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u76ee\u6807\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5b66\u4e60\uff08OCL\uff09\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709slot attention\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528ViT\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5176\u4ed6\u5c42\u8574\u542b\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "MUFASA\u5728ViT\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u5c42\u4e0a\u8ba1\u7b97slot attention\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u5c06\u591a\u5c42slots\u805a\u5408\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u65b0SOTA\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u52a0\u5feb\u8bad\u7ec3\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u4ec5\u5f15\u5165\u8f7b\u5fae\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528ViT\u591a\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3aslot attention-based OCL\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u5206\u5272\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

We argue that this limitation stems from inadequate credit assignment for visual attention during training. To address this issue, we propose SAYO, a visual reasoning model trained with a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that introduces a region-level visual attention-based reward. This reward explicitly aligns optimization signals with visually grounded reasoning steps, enabling the model to learn more reliable attention behaviors.

Maximal Update Parametrization ($\u03bc$P) helps explain why many hyperparameters transfer across width. Yet depth scaling is less understood for modern architectures, whose computation graphs contain multiple parallel paths and residual aggregation. To unify various non-recurrent multi-path neural networks such as CNNs, ResNets, and Transformers, we introduce a graph-based notion of effective depth. Under stabilizing initializations and a maximal-update criterion, we show that the optimal learning rate decays with effective depth following a universal -3/2 power law.

Previous works often rely on heavy, expensive force sensors unsuitable for typical quadrotor platforms, or perform grasping without force feedback, risking damage to fragile objects. To address these limitations, we propose a novel force-aware grasping framework incorporating six low-cost, sensitive skin-like tactile sensors. We introduce a magnetic-based tactile sensing module that provides high-precision three-dimensional force measurements. We eliminate geomagnetic interference through a reference Hall sensor and simplify the calibration process compared to previous work. The proposed framework enables precise force-aware grasping control, allowing safe manipulation of fragile objects and real-time weight measurement of grasped items. The system is validated through comprehensive real-world experiments, including balloon grasping, dynamic load variation tests, and ablation studies, demonstrating its effectiveness in various aerial manipulation scenarios. Our approach achieves fully onboard operation without external motion capture systems, significantly enhancing the practicality of force-sensitive aerial manipulation.

We introduce \\textbf{WorldTravel}, a benchmark comprising 150 real-world travel scenarios across 5 cities that demand navigating an average of 15+ interdependent temporal and logical constraints. To evaluate agents in realistic deployments, we develop \\textbf{WorldTravel-Webscape}, a multi-modal environment featuring over 2,000 rendered webpages where agents must perceive constraint parameters directly from visual layouts to inform their planning. Our evaluation of 10 frontier models reveals a significant performance collapse: even the state-of-the-art GPT-5.2 achieves only 32.67\\% feasibility in text-only settings, which plummets to 19.33\\% in multi-modal environments. We identify a critical Perception-Action Gap and a Planning Horizon threshold at approximately 10 constraints where model reasoning consistently fails, suggesting that perception and reasoning remain independent bottlenecks.

This study investigates the intrinsic few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) capabilities of frozen DINOv3 features through a training-free baseline, FSSDINO, utilizing class-specific prototypes and Gram-matrix refinement. Our results across binary, multi-class, and cross-domain (CDFSS) benchmarks demonstrate that this minimal approach, applied to the final backbone layer, is highly competitive with specialized methods involving complex decoders or test-time adaptation. Crucially, we conduct an Oracle-guided layer analysis, identifying a significant performance gap between the standard last-layer features and globally optimal intermediate representations. We reveal a \"Safest vs. Optimal\" dilemma: while the Oracle proves higher performance is attainable, matching the results of compute-intensive adaptation methods, current unsupervised and support-guided selection metrics consistently yield lower performance than the last-layer baseline. This characterizes a \"Semantic Selection Gap\" in Foundation Models, a disconnect where traditional heuristics fail to reliably identify high-fidelity features. Our work establishes the \"Last-Layer\" as a deceptively strong baseline and provides a rigorous diagnostic of the latent semantic potentials in DINOv3.The code is publicly available at https://github.com/hussni0997/fssdino.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684Few-Shot\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5FSSDINO\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684DINOv3\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7c7b\u7279\u5b9a\u539f\u578b\u4e0eGram\u77e9\u9635\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u867d\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u4f46\u5e76\u975e\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u201c\u8bed\u4e49\u9009\u62e9\u9e3f\u6c9f\u201d\u8fd9\u4e00\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u51bb\u7ed3DINOv3\u7279\u5f81\u5728few-shot\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5728\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u68c0\u9a8c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6781\u7b80\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5426\u5ab2\u7f8e\u590d\u6742\u9002\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8bca\u65ad\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7279\u5f81\u5c42\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFSSDINO\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u51bb\u7ed3DINOv3\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7c7b\u7279\u5b9a\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165Gram\u77e9\u9635\u7ec6\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u8fdb\u884cOracle\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u9010\u5c42\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5404\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u591a\u79cd\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u652f\u6301\u96c6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "FSSDINO\u5728\u4e8c\u503c\u3001\u591a\u7c7b\u53ca\u8de8\u57df\uff08CDFSS\uff09\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u4e13\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff1bOracle\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08\u6700\u4f18\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u8fdc\u8d85\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u5c42\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u9009\u62e9\u6307\u6807\u65e0\u6cd5\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8be5\u6700\u4f18\u5c42\u3002", "conclusion": "DINOv3\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u5c42\u662f\u6781\u5177\u6b3a\u9a97\u6027\u7684\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u5f53\u524d\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u5b58\u5728\u2018\u8bed\u4e49\u9009\u62e9\u9e3f\u6c9f\u2019\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u96be\u4ee5\u88ab\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u9760\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6839\u672c\u5c40\u9650\uff1b\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3aViT\u7279\u5f81\u8bed\u4e49\u6f5c\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e25\u8c28\u8bca\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Such designs offer limited capacity for structural exploration, making it difficult to escape deep local optima in complex Combinatorial Optimization Problems (COPs). In this work, we propose G-LNS, a generative evolutionary framework that extends LLM-based AHD to the automated design of Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) operators. Unlike prior methods that evolve heuristics in isolation, G-LNS leverages LLMs to co-evolve tightly coupled pairs of destroy and repair operators. A cooperative evaluation mechanism explicitly captures their interaction, enabling the discovery of complementary operator logic that jointly performs effective structural disruption and reconstruction. Extensive experiments on challenging COP benchmarks, such as Traveling Salesman Problems (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problems (CVRP), demonstrate that G-LNS significantly outperforms LLM-based AHD methods as well as strong classical solvers. The discovered heuristics not only achieve near-optimal solutions with reduced computational budgets but also exhibit robust generalization across diverse and unseen instance distributions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faG-LNS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u7834\u574f\u4e0e\u4fee\u590d\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u90bb\u57df\u641c\u7d22\uff08LNS\uff09\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728TSP\u548cCVRP\u7b49\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u7ecf\u5178\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u81ea\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08AHD\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u6784\u9020\u6027\u4f18\u5148\u89c4\u5219\u6216\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5c40\u90e8\u641c\u7d22\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u6613\u9677\u5165\u590d\u6742\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u8fdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6G-LNS\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u6210\u5bf9\u7684\u3001\u7d27\u5bc6\u8026\u5408\u7684destroy\u4e0erepair\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u4f5c\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5236\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e8c\u8005\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u4ee5\u53d1\u73b0\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u7b97\u5b50\u903b\u8f91\u3002", "result": "\u5728TSP\u548cCVRP\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\uff0cG-LNS\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709LLM-based AHD\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u5f3a\u7ecf\u5178\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff1b\u6240\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u80fd\u5728\u66f4\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u8fd1\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u6837\u4e14\u672a\u89c1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "G-LNS\u6210\u529f\u5c06LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u62d3\u5c55\u81f3LNS\u7b97\u5b50\u5c42\u9762\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u4e0e\u4ea4\u4e92\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u6c42\u89e3\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

We argue this stems from mimicking raw trajectories without understanding the underlying intent. To address this, we propose explicitly disentangling behavior intent from execution details in end-2-end IL: \\textit{``Mimic Intent, Not just Trajectories'' (MINT)}. We achieve this via \\textit{multi-scale frequency-space tokenization}, which enforces a spectral decomposition of action chunk representation. We learn action tokens with a multi-scale coarse-to-fine structure, and force the coarsest token to capture low-frequency global structure and finer tokens to encode high-frequency details. This yields an abstract \\textit{Intent token} that facilitates planning and transfer, and multi-scale \\textit{Execution tokens} that enable precise adaptation to environmental dynamics. Building on this hierarchy, our policy generates trajectories through \\textit{next-scale autoregression}, performing progressive \\textit{intent-to-execution reasoning}, thus boosting learning efficiency and generalization. Crucially, this disentanglement enables \\textit{one-shot transfer} of skills, by simply injecting the Intent token from a demonstration into the autoregressive generation process.

Recent advancements in NLP, particularly through large language models (LLMs), have greatly improved outcomes in this field. This study introduces ViGoEmotions -- a Vietnamese emotion corpus comprising 20,664 social media comments in which each comment is classified into 27 fine-grained distinct emotions. To evaluate the quality of the dataset and its impact on emotion classification, eight pre-trained Transformer-based models were evaluated under three preprocessing strategies: preserving original emojis with rule-based normalization, converting emojis into textual descriptions, and applying ViSoLex, a model-based lexical normalization system. Results show that converting emojis into text often improves the performance of several BERT-based baselines, while preserving emojis yields the best results for ViSoBERT and CafeBERT. In contrast, removing emojis generally leads to lower performance. ViSoBERT achieved the highest Macro F1-score of 61.50% and Weighted F1-score of 63.26%. Strong performance was also observed from CafeBERT and PhoBERT. These findings highlight that while the proposed corpus can support diverse architectures effectively, preprocessing strategies and annotation quality remain key factors influencing downstream performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86ViGoEmotions\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b20,664\u6761\u8d8a\u5357\u8bed\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u8bc4\u8bba\u3001\u6807\u6ce827\u79cd\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u60c5\u7eea\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u8d8a\u5357\u8bed\u60c5\u7eea\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u4fdd\u7559/\u8f6c\u6362/\u79fb\u9664emoji\uff09\u5bf9\u591a\u4e2aTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u60c5\u7eea\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eViSoBERT\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u4e14\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u8d28\u91cf\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8d8a\u5357\u8bed\u60c5\u7eea\u5206\u6790\u8d44\u6e90\u532e\u4e4f\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8be5\u8bed\u8a00\u60c5\u7eea\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0cemoji\u5728\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u5176\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u5f0f\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86ViGoEmotions\u8d8a\u5357\u8bed\u60c5\u7eea\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0820,664\u6761\u8bc4\u8bba\uff0c27\u7c7b\u60c5\u7eea\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e09\u79cdemoji\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u4fdd\u7559+\u89c4\u5219\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u3001\u8f6c\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u3001\u4f7f\u7528ViSoLex\u6a21\u578b\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\uff09\u4e0b\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e868\u4e2a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982ViSoBERT\u3001CafeBERT\u3001PhoBERT\u7b49\uff09\u7684\u60c5\u7eea\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "ViSoBERT\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u9ad8Macro F1\uff0861.50%\uff09\u548cWeighted F1\uff0863.26%\uff09\uff1b\u5c06emoji\u8f6c\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u666e\u904d\u63d0\u5347BERT\u7c7b\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u800c\u4fdd\u7559emoji\u5219\u6700\u5229\u4e8eViSoBERT\u548cCafeBERT\uff1b\u79fb\u9664emoji\u603b\u4f53\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "ViGoEmotions\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8d8a\u5357\u8bed\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u60c5\u7eea\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u4f46\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u6807\u6ce8\u8d28\u91cf\uff0cemoji\u4e0d\u5e94\u7b80\u5355\u79fb\u9664\uff0c\u9700\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u6027\u5b9a\u5236\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, existing training-free methods often rely on rigid visual feature injection, creating a conflict between identity fidelity and textual adaptability. To address this, we propose FlexID, a novel training-free framework utilizing intent-aware modulation. FlexID orthogonally decouples identity into two dimensions: a Semantic Identity Projector (SIP) that injects high-level priors into the language space, and a Visual Feature Anchor (VFA) that ensures structural fidelity within the latent space. Crucially, we introduce a Context-Aware Adaptive Gating (CAG) mechanism that dynamically modulates the weights of these streams based on editing intent and diffusion timesteps. By automatically relaxing rigid visual constraints when strong editing intent is detected, CAG achieves synergy between identity preservation and semantic variation. Extensive experiments on IBench demonstrate that FlexID achieves a state-of-the-art balance between identity consistency and text adherence, offering an efficient solution for complex narrative generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFlexID\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u610f\u56fe\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u6587\u672c\u9075\u5faa\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u521a\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u6ce8\u5165\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFlexID\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8bed\u4e49\u8eab\u4efd\u6295\u5f71\u5668\uff08SIP\uff09\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u951a\u70b9\uff08VFA\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u95e8\u63a7\uff08CAG\uff09\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u4e8c\u8005\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728IBench\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFlexID\u5728\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6587\u672c\u9075\u5faa\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u590d\u6742\u53d9\u4e8b\u751f\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "FlexID\u4e3a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

This paper introduces the Pavlovian Associative Learning Models Simulator (PALMS), a Python environment to simulate Pavlovian conditioning experiments. In addition to the canonical Rescorla-Wagner model, PALMS incorporates several attentional learning approaches, including Pearce-Kaye-Hall, Mackintosh Extended, Le Pelley's Hybrid, and a novel extension of the Rescorla-Wagner model with a unified variable learning rate that integrates Mackintosh's and Pearce and Hall's opposing conceptualisations. The simulator's graphical interface allows for the input of entire experimental designs in an alphanumeric format, akin to that used by experimental neuroscientists. Moreover, it uniquely enables the simulation of experiments involving hundreds of stimuli, as well as the computation of configural cues and configural-cue compounds across all models, thereby considerably expanding their predictive capabilities. PALMS operates efficiently, providing instant visualisation of results, supporting rapid, precise comparisons of various models' predictions within a single architecture and environment. Furthermore, graphic displays can be easily saved, and simulated data can be exported to spreadsheets.

However, traditional modular pipelines often incur cumulative latency, whereas purely reinforcement learning (RL) approaches typically provide limited formal safety guarantees. To bridge this gap, we propose an end-to-end RL framework augmented with model-based safety mechanisms. We incorporate physical priors in both training and deployment. During training, we design a physics-informed reward structure that provides global navigational guidance. During deployment, we integrate a real-time safety filter that projects the policy outputs onto a provably safe set to enforce strict collision-avoidance constraints. This hybrid architecture reconciles high-speed flight with robust safety assurances. Benchmark evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms both traditional planners and recent end-to-end obstacle avoidance approaches based on differentiable physics.

We propose a cognitively inspired framework for efficient long-context inference based on chunk-wise compression and selective memory recall, rather than processing all raw tokens. The framework segments long inputs into chunks and encodes each chunk into compressed memory representations using a learned compressor. A gating module dynamically selects relevant memory blocks, which are then iteratively processed by a reasoning module with an evolving working memory to solve downstream tasks. The compressor and reasoner are jointly optimized via end-to-end reinforcement learning, while the gating module is trained separately as a classifier. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves competitive accuracy on multi-hop reasoning benchmarks such as RULER-HQA, extrapolates context length from 7K to 1.75M tokens, and offers a favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-off compared to strong long-context baselines. In particular, it achieves up to a 2 times reduction in peak GPU memory usage and a 6 times inference speedup over MemAgent.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u53d7\u8ba4\u77e5\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5757\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8bb0\u5fc6\u53ec\u56de\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u957f\u6587\u672c\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u9057\u5fd8\u53ca\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u788e\u7247\u5316\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u957f\u8f93\u5165\u5206\u5757\uff0c\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u5668\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u538b\u7f29\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u95e8\u63a7\u6a21\u5757\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u76f8\u5173\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5757\uff0c\u5e76\u7531\u5177\u5907\u6f14\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5757\u8fed\u4ee3\u5904\u7406\uff1b\u538b\u7f29\u5668\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u95e8\u63a7\u6a21\u5757\u5355\u72ec\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728RULER-HQA\u7b49\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u53ef\u4ece7K\u6269\u5c55\u81f31.75M tokens\uff0c\u5cf0\u503cGPU\u5185\u5b58\u51cf\u5c112\u500d\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53476\u500d\uff08\u76f8\u6bd4MemAgent\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8ba4\u77e5\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u538b\u7f29\u4e0e\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u56de\u5fc6\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing methods either (i) use end-to-end trained models with vision-language embeddings, which struggle to generalize beyond training data and lack action-level explainability, or (ii) rely on modular zero-shot pipelines with large language models (LLMs) and open-set object detectors, which suffer from error propagation, high computational cost, and difficulty integrating their reasoning back into the navigation policy. To this end, we propose a compact 3B-parameter Vision-Language-Action (VLA) agent that performs human-like embodied reasoning for both object recognition and action selection, removing the need for stitched multi-model pipelines. Instead of raw embedding matching, our agent employs explicit image-grounded reasoning to directly answer \"Is this the target object?\" and \"Why should I take this action?\" The reasoning process unfolds in three stages: \"think\", \"think summary\", and \"action\", yielding improved explainability, stronger generalization, and more efficient navigation.

We implemented Puda as a browser-based system that serves as a common platform across diverse services and evaluated it through a personalized travel planning task. Our results show that providing Predefined Category Subsets achieves 97.2% of the personalization performance (evaluated via an LLM-as-a-Judge framework across three criteria) obtained when sharing Detailed Browsing History.

Standard Behavior Cloning (BC), by mimicking the robot's executed trajectory, fundamentally ignores this compensatory mechanism. In this work, we propose a Dual-State Conditioning framework that shifts the learning objective to \"Intent Cloning\" (master command). We posit that the Intent-Execution Mismatch, the discrepancy between master command and slave response, is not noise, but a critical signal that physically encodes implicit interaction forces and algorithmically reveals the operator's strategy for overcoming system dynamics. By predicting the master intent, our policy learns to generate a \"virtual equilibrium point\", effectively realizing implicit impedance control. Furthermore, by explicitly conditioning on the history of this mismatch, the model performs implicit system identification, perceiving tracking errors as external forces to close the control loop. To bridge the temporal gap caused by inference latency, we further formulate the policy as a trajectory inpainter to ensure continuous control. We validate our approach on a sensorless, low-cost bi-manual setup. Empirical results across tasks requiring contact-rich manipulation and dynamic tracking reveal a decisive gap: while standard execution-cloning fails due to the inability to overcome contact stiffness and tracking lag, our mismatch-aware approach achieves robust success. This presents a minimalist behavior cloning framework for low-cost hardware, enabling force perception and dynamic compensation without relying on explicit force sensing.

Building on this paradigm, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) dLLMs with autoregressive (AR) initialization have further demonstrated strong performance competitive with mainstream AR models. However, we identify a fundamental mismatch between MoE architectures and diffusion-based decoding. Specifically, a large number of experts are activated at each denoising step, while only a small subset of tokens is ultimately accepted, resulting in substantial inference overhead and limiting their deployment in latency-sensitive applications. In this work, we propose TEAM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates MoE dLLMs by enabling more accepted tokens with fewer activated experts. TEAM is motivated by the observation that expert routing decisions exhibit strong temporal consistency across denoising levels as well as spatial consistency across token positions. Leveraging these properties, TEAM employs three complementary expert activation and decoding strategies, conservatively selecting necessary experts for decoded and masked tokens and simultaneously performing aggressive speculative exploration across multiple candidates. Experimental results demonstrate that TEAM achieves up to 2.2x speedup over vanilla MoE dLLM, with negligible performance degradation.

We argue that this fragmentation largely stems from the absence of an analyzable, self-consistent formal model that enables implementation-independent characterization and comparison of LLM agents. To address this gap, we propose the \\texttt{Structural Context Model}, a formal model for analyzing and comparing LLM agents from the perspective of context structure. Building upon this foundation, we introduce two complementary components that together span the full lifecycle of LLM agent research and development: (1) a declarative implementation framework; and (2) a sustainable agent engineering workflow, \\texttt{Semantic Dynamics Analysis}. The proposed workflow provides principled insights into agent mechanisms and supports rapid, systematic design iteration.

However, their sequential autoregressive decoding forces inherently parallel clinical reasoning, such as differential diagnosis, into a single linear reasoning path, limiting both efficiency and reliability for complex medical problems. To address this, we propose MedVerse, a reasoning framework for complex medical inference that reformulates medical reasoning as a parallelizable directed acyclic graph (DAG) process based on Petri net theory. The framework adopts a full-stack design across data, model architecture, and system execution. For data creation, we introduce the MedVerse Curator, an automated pipeline that synthesizes knowledge-grounded medical reasoning paths and transforms them into Petri net-structured representations. At the architectural level, we propose a topology-aware attention mechanism with adaptive position indices that supports parallel reasoning while preserving logical consistency. Systematically, we develop a customized inference engine that supports parallel execution without additional overhead. Empirical evaluations show that MedVerse improves strong general-purpose LLMs by up to 8.9%.

While vision-only methods have become the de facto standard due to their technical advances, they can benefit from effective and cost-efficient fusion with radar measurements. In this work, we advance fusion methods by repurposing Gaussian Splatting as an efficient universal view transformer that bridges the view disparity gap, mapping both image pixels and radar points into a common Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representation. Our main contribution is GaussianCaR, an end-to-end network for BEV segmentation that, unlike prior BEV fusion methods, leverages Gaussian Splatting to map raw sensor information into latent features for efficient camera-radar fusion. Our architecture combines multi-scale fusion with a transformer decoder to efficiently extract BEV features. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance on par with, or even surpassing, the state of the art on BEV segmentation tasks (57.3%, 82.9%, and 50.1% IoU for vehicles, roads, and lane dividers) on the nuScenes dataset, while maintaining a 3.2x faster inference runtime.

Existing methods typically employ coarse-grained attention as a proxy for block importance estimation, but often resort to expensive token-level searching or scoring, resulting in significant selection overhead. In this work, we trace the inaccuracy of standard coarse-grained attention via mean pooling to a theoretical root cause: the interaction between mean pooling and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE). We prove that mean pooling acts as a low-pass filter that induces destructive interference in high-frequency dimensions, effectively creating a \"blind spot\" for local positional information (e.g., slash patterns). To address this, we introduce Prism, a training-free spectral-aware approach that decomposes block selection into high-frequency and low-frequency branches. By applying energy-based temperature calibration, Prism restores the attenuated positional signals directly from pooled representations, enabling block importance estimation using purely block-level operations, thereby improving efficiency. Extensive evaluations confirm that Prism maintains accuracy parity with full attention while delivering up to $\\mathbf{5.1\\times}$ speedup.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPrism\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u8c31\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5757\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u5757\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e2d\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587LLM\u9884\u586b\u5145\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5757\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5757\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u4f9d\u8d56\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff08\u5982\u5747\u503c\u6c60\u5316\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4e0eRoPE\u4ea4\u4e92\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u9891\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u2018\u76f2\u70b9\u2019\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "Prism\u5c06\u5757\u9009\u62e9\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u9ad8\u9891\u4e0e\u4f4e\u9891\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u6e29\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\u4ece\u6c60\u5316\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5168\u7a0b\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5757\u7ea7\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "Prism\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u76f8\u5f53\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u9ad85.1\u500d\u7684\u9884\u586b\u5145\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "Prism\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u3001\u8c31\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5757\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u5747\u503c\u6c60\u5316\u4e0eRoPE\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587LLM\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Gait recognition provides a practical alternative, as it can be captured reliably at a distance. To promote progress in gait recognition and provide a fair evaluation platform, the International Competition on Human Identification at a Distance (HID) has been organized annually since 2020. Since 2023, the competition has adopted the challenging SUSTech-Competition dataset, which features substantial variations in clothing, carried objects, and view angles. No dedicated training data are provided, requiring participants to train their models using external datasets. Each year, the competition applies a different random seed to generate distinct evaluation splits, which reduces the risk of overfitting and supports a fair assessment of cross-domain generalization. While HID 2023 and HID 2024 already used this dataset, HID 2025 explicitly examined whether algorithmic advances could surpass the accuracy limits observed previously. Despite the heightened difficulty, participants achieved further improvements, and the best-performing method reached 94.2% accuracy, setting a new benchmark on this dataset.

Whereas machine learning has been described as the automation of automation, generative AI operates by navigating contextual, semantic, and stylistic coherence rather than optimizing predefined objective metrics. This paper introduces the concept of Vibe-Automation to characterize this transition.\n  The central claim is that the significance of GenAI lies in its functional access to operationalized tacit regularities: context-sensitive patterns embedded in practice that cannot be fully specified through explicit algorithmic rules. Although generative systems do not possess tacit knowledge in a phenomenological sense, they operationalize sensitivities to tone, intent, and situated judgment encoded in high-dimensional latent representations. On this basis, the human role shifts from algorithmic problem specification toward Vibe-Engineering, understood as the orchestration of alignment and contextual judgment in generative systems.\n  The paper connects this epistemological shift to educational and institutional transformation by proposing a conceptual framework structured across three analytical levels and three domains of action: faculty worldview, industry relations, and curriculum design. The risks of mode collapse and cultural homogenization are briefly discussed, emphasizing the need for deliberate engagement with generative systems to avoid regression toward synthetic uniformity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u201c\u6c1b\u56f4\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\uff08Vibe-Automation\uff09\u201d\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u6807\u5fd7\u7740\u4e00\u79cd\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8bba\u8dc3\u8fc1\u2014\u2014\u4ece\u4f18\u5316\u663e\u6027\u6307\u6807\u8f6c\u5411\u6355\u6349\u548c\u8fd0\u4f5c\u9690\u542b\u4e8e\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u5883\u5316\u3001\u9ed8\u4f1a\u6027\u89c4\u5f8b\uff1b\u4eba\u7c7b\u89d2\u8272\u76f8\u5e94\u8f6c\u5411\u201c\u6c1b\u56f4\u5de5\u7a0b\uff08Vibe-Engineering\uff09\u201d\uff0c\u5373\u534f\u8c03\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u60c5\u5883\u5224\u65ad\uff1b\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u6784\u5efa\u8986\u76d6\u6559\u5e08\u8ba4\u77e5\u3001\u4ea7\u4e1a\u5408\u4f5c\u4e0e\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e09\u5c42\u4e09\u57df\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u53d8\u9769\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u800c\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9\u8bed\u5883\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u98ce\u683c\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u5173\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u5f81\u4e0e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u672c\u8d28\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6982\u5ff5\u6765\u523b\u753b\u8fd9\u4e00\u8d28\u53d8\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u5ff5\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u5efa\u6784\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u2018Vibe-Automation\u2019\u4e0e\u2018Vibe-Engineering\u2019\u4e24\u4e2a\u539f\u521b\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8bba\u3001\u5b9e\u8df5\u54f2\u5b66\u4e0e\u6559\u80b2\u5b66\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e09\u5c42\uff08\u6559\u5e08\u4e16\u754c\u89c2\u3001\u4ea7\u4e1a\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff09\u4e09\u57df\uff08\u5206\u6790\u5c42\u7ea7/\u884c\u52a8\u9886\u57df\uff09\u7684\u6574\u5408\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u786e\u7acb\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u80fd\u529b\u5728\u4e8e\u64cd\u4f5c\u5316\u9ed8\u4f1a\u89c4\u5f8b\uff08\u800c\u975e\u62e5\u6709\u9ed8\u4f1a\u77e5\u8bc6\uff09\uff0c\u5398\u6e05\u4e86\u4eba\u673a\u5206\u5de5\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff08\u4ece\u7b97\u6cd5\u95ee\u9898\u8bbe\u5b9a\u8f6c\u5411\u6c1b\u56f4\u5de5\u7a0b\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u9762\u5411\u6559\u80b2\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f6c\u578b\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u5206\u6790\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0e\u98ce\u9669\u8b66\u793a\uff08\u5982\u6a21\u5f0f\u574d\u584c\u3001\u6587\u5316\u540c\u8d28\u5316\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u4e0d\u662f\u6280\u672f\u8fed\u4ee3\u800c\u662f\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8bba\u9769\u547d\uff1b\u5176\u771f\u6b63\u4ef7\u503c\u5728\u4e8e\u62d3\u5c55\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u4e0d\u53ef\u8a00\u660e\u5b9e\u8df5\u667a\u6167\u7684\u6280\u672f\u6027\u4ecb\u5165\u65b9\u5f0f\uff1b\u6559\u80b2\u4e0e\u5236\u5ea6\u54cd\u5e94\u5fc5\u987b\u4e3b\u52a8\u5f15\u5bfc\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u671d\u5411\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u60c5\u5883\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4e0e\u6279\u5224\u6027\u5171\u6cbb\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u88ab\u52a8\u9002\u5e94\u6216\u9677\u5165\u5408\u6210\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u3002"}}

We introduce \"graph-based conformal compression\", a framework for constructing compact subgraphs that preserve statistical validity while reducing structural complexity. We formulate compression as selecting a smallest subgraph capturing a prescribed fraction of the probability mass, and reduce to a weighted version of densest $k$-subgraphs in hypergraphs, in the regime where the subgraph has a large fraction of edges. We design efficient approximation algorithms that achieve constant factor coverage and size trade-offs. Crucially, we prove that our relaxation satisfies a monotonicity property, derived from a connection to parametric minimum cuts, which guarantees the nestedness required for valid conformal guarantees.

We examine this famous critic from both the perspective in pre-existing literature of linguistics and psychology as well as a research based on an experiment inquiring the capacity of learning both possible and impossible languages among LLMs. We constructed a set of syntactically impossible languages by applying certain transformations to English. These include reversing whole sentences, and adding negation based on word-count parity. Two rounds of controlled experiments were each conducted on GPT-2 small models and long short-term memory (LSTM) models. Statistical analysis (Welch's t-test) shows GPT2 small models underperform in learning all of the impossible languages compared to their performance on the possible language (p<.001). On the other hand, LSTM models' performance tallies with Chomsky's argument, suggesting the irreplaceable role of the evolution of transformer architecture.

While existing animal identification methods excel in controlled, single-camera settings, they face severe challenges regarding cross-camera generalization. When models trained on source cameras are deployed to new monitoring nodes characterized by divergent illumination, backgrounds, viewpoints, and heterogeneous imaging properties, recognition performance often degrades dramatically. This limits the large-scale application of non-contact technologies in dynamic, real-world farming environments. To address this challenge, this study proposes a cross-camera cow identification framework based on disentangled representation learning. This framework leverages the Subspace Identifiability Guarantee (SIG) theory in the context of bovine visual recognition. By modeling the underlying physical data generation process, we designed a principle-driven feature disentanglement module that decomposes observed images into multiple orthogonal latent subspaces. This mechanism effectively isolates stable, identity-related biometric features that remain invariant across cameras, thereby substantially improving generalization to unseen cameras. We constructed a high-quality dataset spanning five distinct camera nodes, covering heterogeneous acquisition devices and complex variations in lighting and angles. Extensive experiments across seven cross-camera tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an average accuracy of 86.0%, significantly outperforming the Source-only Baseline (51.9%) and the strongest cross-camera baseline method (79.8%).

While prior studies have explored sycophantic behavior in general contexts, its impact on morally grounded visual decision-making remains insufficiently understood. To address this gap, we present the first systematic study of moral sycophancy in VLMs, analyzing ten widely-used models on the Moralise and M^3oralBench datasets under explicit user disagreement. Our results reveal that VLMs frequently produce morally incorrect follow-up responses even when their initial judgments are correct, and exhibit a consistent asymmetry: models are more likely to shift from morally right to morally wrong judgments than the reverse when exposed to user-induced bias. Follow-up prompts generally degrade performance on Moralise, while yielding mixed or even improved accuracy on M^3oralBench, highlighting dataset-dependent differences in moral robustness. Evaluation using Error Introduction Rate (EIR) and Error Correction Rate (ECR) reveals a clear trade-off: models with stronger error-correction capabilities tend to introduce more reasoning errors, whereas more conservative models minimize errors but exhibit limited ability to self-correct. Finally, initial contexts with a morally right stance elicit stronger sycophantic behavior, emphasizing the vulnerability of VLMs to moral influence and the need for principled strategies to improve ethical consistency and robustness in multimodal AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5728\u9053\u5fb7\u5224\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u8c04\u5a9a\u884c\u4e3a\uff08moral sycophancy\uff09\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5728\u7528\u6237\u610f\u89c1\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u6613\u4ece\u6b63\u786e\u9053\u5fb7\u5224\u65ad\u8f6c\u5411\u9519\u8bef\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u7ea0\u9519\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u9519\u8bef\u5f15\u5165\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u7406\u89e3VLMs\u5728\u9053\u5fb7\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u53d7\u7528\u6237\u610f\u89c1\u5f71\u54cd\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u8c04\u5a9a\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u7528\u6237\u660e\u786e\u8868\u8fbe\u5f02\u8bae\u65f6\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eMoralise\u548cM^3oralBench\u4e24\u4e2a\u9053\u5fb7\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5bf910\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41VLM\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5728\u663e\u5f0f\u7528\u6237\u5f02\u8bae\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5206\u6790\u5176\u521d\u59cb\u4e0e\u540e\u7eed\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165Error Introduction Rate\uff08EIR\uff09\u548cError Correction Rate\uff08ECR\uff09\u91cf\u5316\u9519\u8bef\u5f15\u5165\u4e0e\u4fee\u6b63\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "VLMs\u5728\u7528\u6237\u5f02\u8bae\u4e0b\u5e38\u5c06\u539f\u672c\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u5224\u65ad\u8f6c\u4e3a\u9519\u8bef\uff1b\u5b58\u5728\u53f3\u2192\u9519\u6613\u3001\u9519\u2192\u53f3\u96be\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff1b\u540e\u7eed\u63d0\u793a\u5728Moralise\u4e0a\u666e\u904d\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5728M^3oralBench\u4e0a\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4e00\uff1b\u5f3a\u7ea0\u9519\u80fd\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u6613\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4fdd\u5b88\u6a21\u578b\u5c11\u51fa\u9519\u4f46\u96be\u81ea\u7ea0\uff1b\u521d\u59cb\u9053\u5fb7\u7acb\u573a\u6b63\u786e\u65f6\u8c04\u5a9a\u503e\u5411\u66f4\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "VLMs\u5728\u9053\u5fb7\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u4e14\u8106\u5f31\u7684\u8c04\u5a9a\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u8bbe\u8ba1\u517c\u987e\u4f26\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Yet, understanding how this behavior emerges on natural data is challenging because retrieval and memorization are entangled. To disentangle the two, we introduce Gaussian Match-and-Copy (GMC), a minimalist benchmark that isolates long-range retrieval through pure second-order correlation signals. Numerical investigations show that this task retains key qualitative aspects of how Transformers develop match-and-copy circuits in practice, and separates architectures by their retrieval capabilities. We also analyze the optimization dynamics in a simplified attention setting. Although many solutions are a priori possible under a regression objective, including ones that do not implement retrieval, we identify an implicit-bias regime in which gradient descent drives the parameters to diverge while their direction aligns with the max-margin separator, yielding hard match selection. We prove this max-margin alignment for GD trajectories that reach vanishing empirical loss under explicit technical conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9ad8\u65af\u5339\u914d\u4e0e\u590d\u5236\uff08GMC\uff09\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u79bb\u548c\u7814\u7a76Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u7a0b\u68c0\u7d22\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u9690\u5f0f\u504f\u5411\u4e8e\u6700\u5927\u95f4\u9694\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u786c\u5339\u914d\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u884c\u4e3a\u76f8\u4e92\u7ea0\u7f20\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5355\u72ec\u7406\u89e3\u5339\u914d\u4e0e\u590d\u5236\u8fd9\u4e00\u6838\u5fc3\u68c0\u7d22\u539f\u8bed\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u6d8c\u73b0\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u9694\u79bb\u957f\u7a0b\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7b80\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9ad8\u65af\u5339\u914d\u4e0e\u590d\u5236\uff08GMC\uff09 minimalist \u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7eaf\u4e8c\u9636\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0e\u7b80\u5316\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6280\u672f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8bc1\u660e\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u8f68\u8ff9\u671d\u5411\u6700\u5927\u95f4\u9694\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u65b9\u5411\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "GMC\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86Transformer\u5b9e\u9645\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5f62\u6210\u5339\u914d-\u590d\u5236\u56de\u8def\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5b9a\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u7ecf\u9a8c\u635f\u5931\u8d8b\u8fd1\u96f6\u65f6\uff0c\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u53c2\u6570\u65b9\u5411\u6536\u655b\u81f3\u6700\u5927\u95f4\u9694\u5206\u79bb\u8d85\u5e73\u9762\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5339\u914d\u4e0e\u590d\u5236\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u5728\u65e0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e72\u6270\u4e0b\u7531\u4e8c\u9636\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u53f7\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u4e14\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u5f0f\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4fc3\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u786c\u5339\u914d\u800c\u975e\u8f6f\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3Transformer\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u652f\u6491\u3002"}}

One major goal of offloading a subset of functions in the processing chain of a CAV to remote devices is to reduce the overall computational complexity on the CAV. The extension of using remote services, however, requires careful safety analysis, since the remotely created data are corrupted more easily, e.g., through an attacker on the remote device or by intercepting the wireless transmission. To tackle this problem, we first analyze the concept of SOA for distributed environments. From this, we derive a safety framework that validates the reliability of remote services and the data received locally. Since it is possible for the autonomous driving task to offload multiple different services, we propose a specific multi-staged framework for safety analysis dependent on the service composition of local and remote services. For efficiency reasons, we directly include the multi-staged framework for safety analysis in our service-oriented function offloading framework (SOFOF) that we have proposed in earlier work.

However, existing work lacks a unified answer to three fundamental questions: (1) what defines high-quality reasoning, (2) how to reliably evaluate long, implicitly structured reasoning traces, and (3) how to use such evaluation signals for reasoning optimization. To address these challenges, we provide a unified perspective. (1) We introduce the ME$^2$ principle to characterize reasoning quality along macro- and micro-level concerning efficiency and effectiveness. (2) Built on this principle, we model reasoning traces as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and develop a DAG-based pairwise evaluation method, capturing complex reasoning structures.

We present MammoColor, an end-to-end framework with a Task-Driven Chromatic Encoding (TDCE) module that converts single-channel mammograms into TDCE-encoded views for visual augmentation. Materials and Methods:MammoColor couples a lightweight TDCE module with a BI-RADS triage classifier and was trained end-to-end on VinDr-Mammo. Performance was evaluated on an internal test set, two public datasets (CBIS-DDSM and INBreast), and three external clinical cohorts. We also conducted a multi-reader, multi-case (MRMC) observer study with a washout period, comparing (1) grayscale-only, (2) TDCE-only, and (3) side-by-side grayscale+TDCE. Results:On VinDr-Mammo, MammoColor improved AUC from 0.7669 to 0.8461 (P=0.004). Gains were larger in dense breasts (AUC 0.749 to 0.835). In the MRMC study, TDCE-encoded images improved specificity (0.90 to 0.96; P=0.052) with comparable sensitivity.

SHARP: Shapley Credit-based Optimization for Multi-Agent System", "comment": null, "summary": "Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools via multi-agent systems offers a promising new paradigm for decomposing and solving complex problems. However, training these systems remains notoriously difficult due to the credit assignment challenge, as it is often unclear which specific functional agent is responsible for the success or failure of decision trajectories. Existing methods typically rely on sparse or globally broadcast rewards, failing to capture individual contributions and leading to inefficient reinforcement learning. To address these limitations, we introduce the Shapley-based Hierarchical Attribution for Reinforcement Policy (SHARP), a novel framework for optimizing multi-agent reinforcement learning via precise credit attribution. SHARP effectively stabilizes training by normalizing agent-specific advantages across trajectory groups, primarily through a decomposed reward mechanism comprising a global broadcast-accuracy reward, a Shapley-based marginal-credit reward for each agent, and a tool-process reward to improve execution efficiency. Extensive experiments across various real-world benchmarks demonstrate that SHARP significantly outperforms recent state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average match improvements of 23.66% and 14.05% over single-agent and multi-agent approaches, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSHARP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Shapley\u503c\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5c42\u5f52\u56e0\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LLM\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u534f\u540c\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u5f52\u56e0\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5404\u4ee3\u7406\u5bf9\u51b3\u7b56\u6210\u8d25\u7684\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f4e\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eShapley\u503c\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u5f52\u56e0\u6846\u67b6SHARP\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5168\u5c40\u5e7f\u64ad\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5956\u52b1\u3001Shapley\u8fb9\u9645\u4fe1\u7528\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u6d41\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ec4\u5185\u4ee3\u7406\u4f18\u52bf\u8fdb\u884c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cSHARP\u5e73\u5747\u5339\u914d\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u57fa\u7ebf\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u534723.66%\u548c14.05%\u3002", "conclusion": "SHARP\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In Time Series Classification (TSC), ensembles have proven highly effective whether based on neural networks (NNs) or traditional methods like HIVE-COTE. However most existing NN-based ensemble methods for TSC train multiple models with identical architectures and configurations. These ensembles aggregate predictions without explicitly promoting diversity which often leads to redundant feature representations and limits the benefits of ensembling. In this work, we introduce a diversity-driven ensemble learning framework that explicitly encourages feature diversity among neural network ensemble members. Our approach employs a decorrelated learning strategy using a feature orthogonality loss applied directly to the learned feature representations. This ensures that each model in the ensemble captures complementary rather than redundant information.

In this work, we revisit the necessity of such dense visual processing and show that projected visual embeddings are already well-aligned with the language space, while effective vision-language interaction occurs in only a small subset of layers. Based on these insights, we propose ViCA (Vision-only Cross-Attention), a minimal MLLM architecture in which visual tokens bypass all self-attention and feed-forward layers, interacting with text solely through sparse cross-attention at selected layers. Extensive evaluations across three MLLM backbones, nine multimodal benchmarks, and 26 pruning-based baselines show that ViCA preserves 98% of baseline accuracy while reducing visual-side computation to 4%, consistently achieving superior performance-efficiency trade-offs. Moreover, ViCA provides a regular, hardware-friendly inference pipeline that yields over 3.5x speedup in single-batch inference and over 10x speedup in multi-batch inference, reducing visual grounding to near-zero overhead compared with text-only LLMs. It is also orthogonal to token pruning methods and can be seamlessly combined for further efficiency gains.

A key limitation is that many VLMs rely on surface correlations rather than building logically coherent structured representations, which often leads to missed higher-level semantic structure and non-causal relational understanding, hindering compositional and verifiable reasoning. To address these limitations by introducing human models into the reasoning process, we propose CoTZero, an annotation-free paradigm with two components: (i) a dual-stage data synthesis approach and (ii) a cognition-aligned training method. In the first component, we draw inspiration from neurocognitive accounts of compositional productivity and global-to-local analysis. In the bottom-up stage, CoTZero extracts atomic visual primitives and incrementally composes them into diverse, structured question-reasoning forms. In the top-down stage, it enforces hierarchical reasoning by using coarse global structure to guide the interpretation of local details and causal relations. In the cognition-aligned training component, built on the synthesized CoT data, we introduce Cognitively Coherent Verifiable Rewards (CCVR) in Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) to further strengthen VLMs' hierarchical reasoning and generalization, providing stepwise feedback on reasoning coherence and factual correctness. Experiments show that CoTZero achieves an F1 score of 83.33 percent on our multi-level semantic inconsistency benchmark with lexical-perturbation negatives, across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings. Ablations confirm that each component contributes to more interpretable and human-aligned visual reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCoTZero\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u8ba4\u77e5\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u8868\u9762\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u903b\u8f91\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u96be\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u9ad8\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCoTZero\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\uff08i\uff09\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u2014\u2014\u5e95\u5c42\u63d0\u53d6\u89c6\u89c9\u539f\u5b50\u5355\u5143\u5e76\u7ec4\u5408\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u95ee\u7b54\u63a8\u7406\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u9876\u5c42\u5229\u7528\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u5f15\u5bfc\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\u4e0e\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u7406\u89e3\uff1b\uff08ii\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u5408\u6210\u94fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e00\u81f4\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\uff08CCVR\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5206\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u4e0e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cCoTZero\u53d6\u5f9783.33%\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\uff08\u542b\u8bcd\u6c47\u6270\u52a8\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u57df\u5185\u4e0e\u8de8\u57df\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff1b\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5404\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CoTZero\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8ba4\u77e5\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u65e0\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86VLMs\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u3001\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fc8\u5411\u4eba\u7c7b\u6c34\u5e73\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

To address this, a surge of deep generative models has recently emerged to learn dynamics at coarsened timesteps for efficient trajectory generation, yet they either generalize poorly across systems or, due to limited molecular diversity of trajectory data, fail to fully exploit structural information to improve generative fidelity. Here, we present the Pretrained Variational Bridge (PVB) in an encoder-decoder fashion, which maps the initial structure into a noised latent space and transports it toward stage-specific targets through augmented bridge matching. This unifies training on both single-structure and paired trajectory data, enabling consistent use of cross-domain structural knowledge across training stages. Moreover, for protein-ligand complexes, we further introduce a reinforcement learning-based optimization via adjoint matching that speeds progression toward the holo state, which supports efficient post-optimization of docking poses. Experiments on proteins and protein-ligand complexes demonstrate that PVB faithfully reproduces thermodynamic and kinetic observables from MD while delivering stable and efficient generative dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u53d8\u5206\u6865\uff08PVB\uff09\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u6865\u5339\u914d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u5229\u7528\u5355\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u914d\u5bf9\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u86cb\u767d-\u914d\u4f53\u590d\u5408\u7269\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4f34\u968f\u5339\u914d\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u8fbe\u5230\u5168\u606f\u6001\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5bf9\u63a5\u6784\u8c61\u540e\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff08MD\uff09\u6a21\u62df\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8de8\u7cfb\u7edf\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6216\u5229\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u53d8\u5206\u6865\uff08PVB\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u521d\u59cb\u7ed3\u6784\u6620\u5c04\u81f3\u52a0\u566a\u9690\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u6865\u5339\u914d\u5411\u9636\u6bb5\u7279\u5b9a\u76ee\u6807\u4f20\u8f93\uff1b\u7edf\u4e00\u8bad\u7ec3\u5355\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u914d\u5bf9\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u9488\u5bf9\u86cb\u767d-\u914d\u4f53\u590d\u5408\u7269\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4f34\u968f\u5339\u914d\u4f18\u5316\u4ee5\u52a0\u901f\u8d8b\u5411holo\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u53ca\u86cb\u767d-\u914d\u4f53\u590d\u5408\u7269\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPVB\u80fd\u5fe0\u5b9e\u590d\u73b0MD\u7684\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u5b9a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "conclusion": "PVB\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u57df\u7ed3\u6784\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e00\u81f4\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

However, these are rarely available for high-dimensional mechanical systems such as deformable objects or soft robots. While neural architectures can learn to approximate complex dynamics, they are either limited to low-dimensional systems or provide only limited formal control guarantees due to a lack of embedded physical structure. This paper introduces a latent control framework based on learned structure-preserving reduced-order dynamics for high-dimensional Lagrangian systems. We derive a reduced tracking law for fully actuated systems and adopt a Riemannian perspective on projection-based model-order reduction to study the resulting latent and projected closed-loop dynamics. By quantifying the sources of modeling error, we derive interpretable conditions for stability and convergence. We extend the proposed controller and analysis to underactuated systems by introducing learned actuation patterns.

A Mechanistic Analysis of Cell Location", "comment": null, "summary": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for table-related tasks, the internal mechanisms enabling them to process linearized two-dimensional structured tables remain opaque. In this work, we investigate the process of table understanding by dissecting the atomic task of cell location. Through activation patching and complementary interpretability techniques, we delineate the table understanding mechanism into a sequential three-stage pipeline: Semantic Binding, Coordinate Localization, and Information Extraction. We demonstrate that models locate the target cell via an ordinal mechanism that counts discrete delimiters to resolve coordinates. Furthermore, column indices are encoded within a linear subspace that allows for precise steering of model focus through vector arithmetic. Finally, we reveal that models generalize to multi-cell location tasks by multiplexing the identical attention heads identified during atomic location.

The approach combines geological modelling, synthetic data generation, and supervised image segmentation to address limited real data and class imbalance. First, discrete fracture network models are used to generate synthetic jointed rock images at field-relevant scales via parametric modelling, preserving joint persistence, connectivity, and node-type distributions. Second, segmentation models are trained using mixed training and pretraining followed by fine-tuning on real images. The method is tested in box and slope domains using several real datasets. The results show that synthetic data can support supervised joint trace detection when real data are scarce. Mixed training performs well when real labels are consistent (e.g. box-domain), while fine-tuning is more robust when labels are noisy (e.g. slope-domain where labels can be biased, incomplete, and inconsistent). Fully zero-shot prediction from synthetic model remains limited, but useful generalisation is achieved by fine-tuning with a small number of real data. Qualitative analysis shows clearer and more geologically meaningful joint traces than indicated by quantitative metrics alone. The proposed method supports reliable joint mapping and provides a basis for further work on domain adaptation and evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5730\u8d28\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u5272\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u5ca9\u4f53\u8282\u7406\u8ff9\u7ebf\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u6620\u5c04\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u771f\u5b9e\u5ca9\u4f53\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u3001\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u53ca\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8282\u7406\u8ff9\u7ebf\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u5730\u8d28\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u88c2\u9699\u7f51\u7edc\uff08DFN\uff09\u5efa\u6a21\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u91ce\u5916\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u5408\u6210\u8282\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08\u5408\u6210+\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\uff09\u4e0e\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u5fae\u8c03\uff09\u7b56\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5728\u7bb1\u57df\u548c\u5761\u57df\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u8865\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b\u6df7\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u4e00\u81f4\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u7bb1\u57df\uff09\u8868\u73b0\u597d\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u5927\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u5761\u57df\uff09\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\uff1b\u4ec5\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u771f\u5b9e\u6837\u672c\u5fae\u8c03\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\uff1b\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u7ed3\u679c\u66f4\u5177\u5730\u8d28\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5730\u8d28\u9a71\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8282\u7406\u8ff9\u7ebf\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose an effect-centric, admissibility-first framework that treats discovered graphs as structural hypotheses and evaluates them by identifiability, stability, and falsification rather than by graph recovery accuracy alone. Empirically, we study the effect of early exposure to competitive gameplay on short-term retention using real-world game telemetry. We find that many statistically plausible discovery outputs do not admit point-identified causal queries once minimal temporal and semantic constraints are enforced, highlighting identifiability as a critical bottleneck for decision support. When identification is possible, several algorithm families converge to similar, decision-consistent effect estimates despite producing substantially different graph structures, including cases where the direct treatment-outcome edge is absent and the effect is preserved through indirect causal pathways. These converging estimates survive placebo, subsampling, and sensitivity refutation. In contrast, other methods exhibit sporadic admissibility and threshold-sensitive or attenuated effects due to endpoint ambiguity. These results suggest that graph-level metrics alone are inadequate proxies for causal reliability for a given target query. Therefore, trustworthy causal conclusions in telemetry-driven systems require prioritizing admissibility and effect-level validation over causal structural recovery alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4ee5\u6548\u5e94\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3001\u4ee5\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u4e3a\u5148\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5728\u53cd\u9988\u9a71\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5bf9\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u8bc1\u4f2a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5355\u7eaf\u8ffd\u6c42\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u6062\u590d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0a\u5408\u7406\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u7ed3\u679c\u5728\u52a0\u5165\u57fa\u672c\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u7ea6\u675f\u540e\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u70b9\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u800c\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5219\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\u4ecd\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6548\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9065\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u81ea\u6211\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u9a71\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5176\u7528\u4e8e\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6548\u5e94\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3001\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u4f18\u5148\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u89c6\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u8bc1\u4f2a\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6e38\u620f\u9065\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u65e9\u671f\u7ade\u6280\u4f53\u9a8c\u5bf9\u77ed\u671f\u7559\u5b58\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u8bb8\u591a\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0a\u5408\u7406\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u5728\u65bd\u52a0\u57fa\u672c\u65f6\u5e8f\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7ea6\u675f\u540e\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u76ee\u6807\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u70b9\u8bc6\u522b\uff1b\u5f53\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u65f6\uff0c\u591a\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u867d\u8f93\u51fa\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\u7684\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5374\u6536\u655b\u5230\u76f8\u4f3c\u4e14\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6548\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u76f4\u63a5\u8fb9\u7f3a\u5931\u4f46\u6548\u5e94\u7ecf\u95f4\u63a5\u8def\u5f84\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u60c5\u5f62\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u8be5\u4f30\u8ba1\u901a\u8fc7\u5b89\u6170\u5242\u68c0\u9a8c\u3001\u5b50\u62bd\u6837\u4e0e\u654f\u611f\u6027\u53cd\u9a73\uff1b\u800c\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5219\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u6548\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\u5bf9\u9608\u503c\u654f\u611f\u6216\u8870\u51cf\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56fe\u5c42\u9762\u6307\u6807\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u4ee3\u7406\u7279\u5b9a\u76ee\u6807\u56e0\u679c\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff1b\u5728\u9065\u6d4b\u9a71\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e94\u4f18\u5148\u4fdd\u969c\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u5e94\u7ea7\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u8ffd\u6c42\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u6062\u590d\u3002"}}

When trying to turn these metrics into a single ranking, natural aggregation procedures can become incoherent or unstable to changes in the model set. We formalize this aggregation as a social choice problem where each metric induces a preference ranking over models on each dataset, and a benchmark operator aggregates these votes across metrics. While prior work has focused on Arrow's impossibility result, we argue that the impossibility often originates from pathological examples and identify sufficient conditions under which these disappear, and meaningful multi-criteria benchmarking becomes possible. In particular, we deal with three restrictions on the combinations of rankings and prove that on single-peaked, group-separable and distance-restricted preferences, the benchmark operator allows for the construction of well-behaved rankings of the involved models. Empirically, we investigate several modern benchmark suites like HELM MMLU and verify which structural conditions are fulfilled on which benchmark problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u591a\u6307\u6807\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u793e\u4f1a\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u504f\u597d\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5355\u5cf0\u3001\u7ec4\u53ef\u5206\u3001\u8ddd\u79bb\u53d7\u9650\uff09\u4e0b\u5982\u4f55\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6392\u540d\uff0c\u5e76\u5728HELM MMLU\u7b49\u73b0\u4ee3\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\uff08\u5982HELM MMLU\uff09\u5305\u542b\u591a\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\uff08\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5c06\u5176\u805a\u5408\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u6392\u540d\u65f6\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6216\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff1b\u9700\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u5c42\u9762\u7406\u89e3\u4f55\u65f6\u53ca\u4e3a\u4f55\u805a\u5408\u53ef\u884c\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u591a\u6307\u6807\u57fa\u51c6\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u793e\u4f1a\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u4ea7\u751f\u4e00\u4e2a\u504f\u597d\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u57fa\u51c6\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u9700\u8de8\u6307\u6807\u805a\u5408\uff1b\u5206\u6790Arrow\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u5b9a\u7406\u5728\u8be5\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u4f7f\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u6d88\u5931\u7684\u4e09\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u7ed3\u6784\u9650\u5236\uff08\u5355\u5cf0\u6027\u3001\u7ec4\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u3001\u8ddd\u79bb\u9650\u5236\u6027\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\uff1a\u5728\u5355\u5cf0\u3001\u7ec4\u53ef\u5206\u548c\u8ddd\u79bb\u53d7\u9650\u504f\u597d\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u826f\u5b9a\u4e49\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u53d1\u73b0HELM MMLU\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u4e2d\u90e8\u5206\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u6784\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6307\u6807\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u5408\u7406\u805a\u5408\u5e76\u975e\u666e\u904d\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u800c\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u504f\u597d\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6392\u540d\u3002"}}

A critical component of this interaction is Interactive Visual Grounding (IVG), through which robots must interpret human intentions and resolve ambiguity. Existing IVG models generally lack a mechanism to determine when to ask clarification questions, as they implicitly rely on their learned representations. CLUE addresses this gap by converting the VLM's cross-modal attention into an explicit, spatially grounded signal for deciding when to ask. We extract text to image attention maps and pass them to a lightweight CNN to detect referential ambiguity, while a LoRA fine-tuned decoder conducts the dialog and emits grounding location tokens. We train on a real-world interactive dataset for IVG, and a mixed ambiguity set for the detector. With InViG-only supervision, our model surpasses a state-of-the-art method while using parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Similarly, the ambiguity detector outperforms prior baselines. Overall, CLUE turns the internal cross-modal attention of a VLM into an explicit, spatially grounded signal for deciding when to ask.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in advancing the field of quality estimation of machine translation. However, most of the QE approaches solely rely on scalar quality scores, offering no explicit information about the translation errors that should drive these judgments. Moreover, for low-resource languages where annotated QE data is limited, existing approaches struggle to achieve reliable performance. To address these challenges, we introduce the first segment-level QE dataset for English to Malayalam, a severely resource-scarce language pair in the QE domain, comprising human-annotated Direct Assessment (DA) scores and Translation Quality Remarks (TQR), which are short, contextual, free-form annotator comments that describe translation errors. We further introduce ALOPE-RL, a policy-based reinforcement learning framework that trains efficient adapters based on policy rewards derived from DA score and TQR. Integrating error-aware rewards with ALOPE-RL, enables LLMs to reason about translation quality beyond numeric scores. Despite being trained on a small-scale QE dataset, ALOPE-RL achieves state-of-the-art performance on English to Malayalam QE using compact LLMs (<=4B parameters}) fine-tuned with LoRA and 4-bit quantization, outperforming both larger LLM-based baselines and leading encoder-based QE models. Our results demonstrate that error-aware, policy-based learning can deliver strong QE performance under limited data and compute budgets.

This report presents a systematical post-training framework that organizes supervised policy shaping, reward-driven reinforcement learning, and preference-based refinement into a single stability-constrained optimization stack. The framework is designed around practical video-generation constraints, including high rollout cost, temporally compounding failure modes, and feedback that is heterogeneous, uncertain, and often weakly discriminative. By treating optimization as a staged, diagnostic-driven process rather than a collection of isolated tricks, the report summarizes a cohesive recipe for improving perceptual fidelity, temporal coherence, and prompt adherence while preserving the controllability established at initialization. The resulting framework provides a clear blueprint for building scalable post-training pipelines that remain stable, extensible, and effective in real-world deployment settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u76d1\u7763\u7b56\u7565\u5851\u9020\u3001\u5956\u52b1\u9a71\u52a8\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u504f\u597d\u7684\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u65f6\u5e8f\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u9075\u5faa\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u4e0e\u65f6\u5e8f\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5e94\u5bf9\u9ad8\u91c7\u6837\u6210\u672c\u3001\u65f6\u5e8f\u7d2f\u79ef\u9519\u8bef\u53ca\u5f31/\u5f02\u6784\u53cd\u9988\u7b49\u73b0\u5b9e\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\u6808\uff0c\u4f9d\u6b21\u6574\u5408\u76d1\u7763\u7b56\u7565\u5851\u9020\u3001\u5956\u52b1\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u504f\u597d\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7ec6\u5316\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u8bca\u65ad\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c staged \u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u63d0\u793a\u9075\u5faa\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u521d\u59cb\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6e05\u6670\u84dd\u56fe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u8bca\u65ad\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5b64\u7acb\u6280\u5de7\u7684\u5806\u780c\uff0c\u662f\u6784\u5efa\u9762\u5411\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Recent methods leverage Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance parallel thinking, aiming to address the limitations in computational resources and effectiveness encountered with supervised fine-tuning. However, most existing studies primarily focus on optimizing the aggregation phase, with limited attention to the path exploration stage. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the optimization of parallel thinking under the Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) setting, and identify that the mutual information bottleneck among exploration paths fundamentally restricts overall performance. To address this, we propose Outline-Guided Path Exploration (OPE), which explicitly partitions the solution space by generating diverse reasoning outlines prior to parallel path reasoning, thereby reducing information redundancy and improving the diversity of information captured across exploration paths. We implement OPE with an iterative RL strategy that optimizes outline planning and outline-guided reasoning independently. Extensive experiments across multiple challenging mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that OPE effectively improves reasoning performance in different aggregation strategies, enabling LRMs to more reliably discover correct solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faOutline-Guided Path Exploration (OPE)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u7eb2\u6765\u5f15\u5bfc\u5e76\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u4fe1\u606f\u5197\u4f59\u4e0e\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u805a\u5408\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u8def\u5f84\u63a2\u7d22\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faOPE\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5148\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u7eb2\u4ee5\u5212\u5206\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u518d\u8fdb\u884c\u63d0\u7eb2\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u63a8\u7406\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u8fed\u4ee3\u5f0fRL\u7b56\u7565\u5206\u522b\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u7eb2\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u63d0\u7eb2\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86OPE\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e0d\u540c\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u89e3\u53d1\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8def\u5f84\u63a2\u7d22\uff08\u5982\u63d0\u7eb2\u5f15\u5bfc\uff09\u53ef\u7a81\u7834\u5e76\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u662f\u63d0\u5347LRMs\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Existing mitigation strategies often face critical limitations: they either yield insufficient outlier suppression or incur significant deployment inefficiencies, such as inference latency, heavy preprocessing, or reliance on complex operator fusion. To resolve these limitations, we leverage a key insight: over-parameterized LLMs often converge to Flat Minima, implying a vast equivalent solution space where weights can be adjusted without compromising accuracy. Building on this, we propose Astro, an Activation-guided Structured Regularization framework designed to suppress the negative effects of outliers in a hardware-friendly and efficient manner. Leveraging the activation-guided regularization objective, Astro actively reconstructs intrinsically robust weights, aggressively suppressing weight outliers corresponding to high-magnitude activations without sacrificing model accuracy. Crucially, Astro introduces zero inference latency and is orthogonal to mainstream quantization methods like GPTQ.

Addressing this challenge calls for analyzing interactions between agents and incorporating common-sense reasoning into planning. This paper presents a social robot navigation framework that integrates geometric planning with contextual social reasoning. The system first extracts obstacles and human dynamics to generate geometrically feasible candidate paths, then leverages a fine-tuned vision-language model (VLM) to evaluate these paths, informed by contextually grounded social expectations, selecting a socially optimized path for the controller. This task-specific VLM distills social reasoning from large foundation models into a smaller and efficient model, allowing the framework to perform real-time adaptation in diverse human-robot interaction contexts. Experiments in four social navigation contexts demonstrate that our method achieves the best overall performance with the lowest personal space violation duration, the minimal pedestrian-facing time, and no social zone intrusions.

However, the prevailing autoregressive paradigm imposes strict serial constraints, limiting generation efficiency and introducing exposure bias. In this paper, we investigate Masked Diffusion Modeling~(MDM) as a non-autoregressive paradigm for speech LLMs and introduce VocalNet-MDM. To adapt MDM for streaming speech interaction, we address two critical challenges: training-inference mismatch and iterative overhead. We propose Hierarchical Block-wise Masking to align training objectives with the progressive masked states encountered during block diffusion decoding, and Iterative Self-Distillation to compress multi-step refinement into fewer steps for low-latency inference. Trained on a limited scale of only 6K hours of speech data, VocalNet-MDM achieves a 3.7$\\times$--10$\\times$ decoding speedup and reduces first-chunk latency by 34\\% compared to AR baselines.

The models are available at https://huggingface.co/collections/StevenHH2000/fine-r1", "summary": "Any entity in the visual world can be hierarchically grouped based on shared characteristics and mapped to fine-grained sub-categories. While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on coarse-grained visual tasks, they often struggle with Fine-Grained Visual Recognition (FGVR). Adapting general-purpose MLLMs to FGVR typically requires large amounts of annotated data, which is costly to obtain, leaving a substantial performance gap compared to contrastive CLIP models dedicated for discriminative tasks. Moreover, MLLMs tend to overfit to seen sub-categories and generalize poorly to unseen ones. To address these challenges, we propose Fine-R1, an MLLM tailored for FGVR through an R1-style training framework: (1) Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-tuning, where we construct a high-quality FGVR CoT dataset with rationales of \"visual analysis, candidate sub-categories, comparison, and prediction\", transition the model into a strong open-world classifier; and (2) Triplet Augmented Policy Optimization, where Intra-class Augmentation mixes trajectories from anchor and positive images within the same category to improve robustness to intra-class variance, while Inter-class Augmentation maximizes the response distinction conditioned on images across sub-categories to enhance discriminative ability. With only 4-shot training, Fine-R1 outperforms existing general MLLMs, reasoning MLLMs, and even contrastive CLIP models in identifying both seen and unseen sub-categories, showing promise in working in knowledge-intensive domains where gathering expert annotations for all sub-categories is arduous.

Recent research has focused on designing models to learn the evolutionary nature of TKGs to predict future facts, achieving impressive results. For instance, Hits@10 scores over 0.9 on YAGO dataset. However, we find that existing benchmarks inadvertently introduce a shortcut. Near state-of-the-art performance can be simply achieved by counting co-occurrences, without using any temporal information. In this work, we examine the root cause of this issue, identifying inherent biases in current datasets and over simplified form of evaluation task that can be exploited by these biases. Through this analysis, we further uncover additional limitations of existing benchmarks, including unreasonable formatting of time-interval knowledge, ignorance of learning knowledge obsolescence, and insufficient information for precise evolution understanding, all of which can amplify the shortcut and hinder a fair assessment.

Existing approaches largely rely on human teleoperation with wearable devices or specialized sensing equipment to capture hand-object interactions, which limits scalability. In this work, we propose VIDEOMANIP, a device-free framework that learns dexterous manipulation directly from RGB human videos. Leveraging recent advances in computer vision, VIDEOMANIP reconstructs explicit 4D robot-object trajectories from monocular videos by estimating human hand poses, object meshes, and retargets the reconstructed human motions to robotic hands for manipulation learning. To make the reconstructed robot data suitable for dexterous manipulation training, we introduce hand-object contact optimization with interaction-centric grasp modeling, as well as a demonstration synthesis strategy that generates diverse training trajectories from a single video, enabling generalizable policy learning without additional robot demonstrations. In simulation, the learned grasping model achieves a 70.25% success rate across 20 diverse objects using the Inspire Hand. In the real world, manipulation policies trained from RGB videos achieve an average 62.86% success rate across seven tasks using the LEAP Hand, outperforming retargeting-based methods by 15.87%.

However, deploying these models in production can be inefficient when only a subset of the supported languages is of interest. There has been some research conducted on identifying whether machine translation models have language-specific or language-agnostic heads, however no research has been conducted for multilingual LLMs, to the best of our knowledge, that as we know are capable of performing diverse tasks beyond just translation. This paper explores whether multilingual LLMs have specialized language attention heads for each language, and investigates the possibility of removing language-specific heads for unwanted languages without degrading performance in the targeted languages. Our findings could inform more efficient deployment strategies for multilingual LLMs, enabling reduced model complexity while maintaining high accuracy for targeted languages.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u80fd\u5426\u5728\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u8a00\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u79fb\u9664\u975e\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u4e13\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u90e8\u7f72\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u8bed\u8a00LLM\u5728\u751f\u4ea7\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u82e5\u4ec5\u9700\u652f\u6301\u90e8\u5206\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u5c1a\u65e0\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u591a\u8bed\u8a00LLM\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u591a\u8bed\u8a00LLM\u4e2d\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6027\u5730\u79fb\u9664\u4e0e\u975e\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u8a00\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u8bed\u8a00LLM\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u79fb\u9664\u975e\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5934\u800c\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u8a00\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u53d1\u73b0\u652f\u6301\u901a\u8fc7\u526a\u679d\u8bed\u8a00\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u5757\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00LLM\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Although whole-slide images (WSIs) provide rich morphological information, prior computational pathology approaches typically address metastatic status or site prediction as isolated tasks, and do not explicitly model the clinically sequential decision process of metastatic risk assessment followed by downstream site-specific evaluation. To address this research gap, we present a decision-aware, concept-aligned MIL framework, HistoMet, for prognostic metastatic outcome prediction from primary tumor WSIs. Our proposed framework adopts a two-module prediction pipeline in which the likelihood of metastatic progression from the primary tumor is first estimated, followed by conditional prediction of metastatic site for high-risk cases. To guide representation learning and improve clinical interpretability, our framework integrates linguistically defined and data-adaptive metastatic concepts through a pretrained pathology vision-language model. We evaluate HistoMet on a multi-institutional pan-cancer cohort of 6504 patients with metastasis follow-up and site annotations. Under clinically relevant high-sensitivity screening settings (95 percent sensitivity), HistoMet significantly reduces downstream workload while maintaining high metastatic risk recall. Conditional on metastatic cases, HistoMet achieves a macro F1 of 74.6 with a standard deviation of 1.3 and a macro one-vs-rest AUC of 92.1. These results demonstrate that explicitly modeling clinical decision structure enables robust and deployable prognostic prediction of metastatic progression and site tropism directly from primary tumor histopathology.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faHistoMet\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51b3\u7b56\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u6982\u5ff5\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u5168\u5207\u7247\u56fe\u50cf\u9884\u6d4b\u539f\u53d1\u80bf\u7624\u7684\u8f6c\u79fb\u98ce\u9669\u53ca\u8f6c\u79fb\u90e8\u4f4d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e34\u5e8a\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u8f6c\u79fb\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u90e8\u4f4d\u9884\u6d4b\u89c6\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u672a\u5efa\u6a21\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e2d\u5148\u8bc4\u4f30\u8f6c\u79fb\u98ce\u9669\u3001\u518d\u5224\u65ad\u5177\u4f53\u90e8\u4f4d\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u6a21\u5757\u51b3\u7b56\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u4f30\u8ba1\u539f\u53d1\u80bf\u7624\u8f6c\u79fb\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u518d\u5bf9\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u75c5\u4f8b\u6761\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u8f6c\u79fb\u90e8\u4f4d\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u75c5\u7406\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8f6c\u79fb\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u57286504\u4f8b\u591a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6cdb\u764c\u961f\u5217\u4e0a\uff0c95%\u9ad8\u654f\u611f\u7b5b\u67e5\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e0b\u6e38\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u53ec\u56de\uff1b\u6761\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u8f6c\u79fb\u90e8\u4f4d\u8fbemacro F1 74.6\uff08\u00b11.3\uff09\u548cmacro one-vs-rest AUC 92.1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u7ed3\u6784\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u539f\u53d1\u80bf\u7624\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5b66\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8f6c\u79fb\u8fdb\u5c55\u4e0e\u90e8\u4f4d\u8d8b\u5411\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u3002"}}

Recent studies show that longer reasoning chains are frequently uncorrelated with correctness and can even be detrimental to accuracy. In a further in-depth analysis of this phenomenon, we surprisingly uncover and empirically verify that LRMs implicitly know the appropriate time to stop thinking, while this capability is obscured by current sampling paradigms. Motivated by this, we introduce SAGE (Self-Aware Guided Efficient Reasoning), a novel sampling paradigm that unleashes this efficient reasoning potential.

A fundamental tension limits this approach: language is often too abstract to guide the concrete physical understanding required for robust manipulation. In this work, we introduce Contact-Anchored Policies (CAP), which replace language conditioning with points of physical contact in space. Simultaneously, we structure CAP as a library of modular utility models rather than a monolithic generalist policy. This factorization allows us to implement a real-to-sim iteration cycle: we build EgoGym, a lightweight simulation benchmark, to rapidly identify failure modes and refine our models and datasets prior to real-world deployment. We show that by conditioning on contact and iterating via simulation, CAP generalizes to novel environments and embodiments out of the box on three fundamental manipulation skills while using only 23 hours of demonstration data, and outperforms large, state-of-the-art VLAs in zero-shot evaluations by 56%. All model checkpoints, codebase, hardware, simulation, and datasets will be open-sourced.

Although improving Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning has attracted significant research efforts, the extent to which the fundamental paradigms induce generalization has yet to be systematically explored. In this study, we shed light on how the interplay between these core paradigms influences LLMs' reasoning behavior. To this end, we first collect a new dataset of reasoning trajectories from symbolic tasks, each targeting one of the three fundamental paradigms, to abstract from concrete world knowledge. Then, we investigate effective ways for inducing these skills into LLMs. We experiment with a battery of methods including simple fine-tuning, and more complex approaches to increase model depth, or transform a dense model to a mixture-of-experts. We comprehensively evaluate induced models on realistic out-of-domain tasks, that are entirely formulated in natural language and contain real-world knowledge.

However, despite excelling at general search, existing agents often struggle to bridge the cognitive gap between pixel-level perception and high-level marketing logic. To address this challenge, we introduce AD-MIR, a framework designed to decode advertising intent via a two-stage architecture. First, in the Structure-Aware Memory Construction phase, the system converts raw video into a structured database by integrating semantic retrieval with exact keyword matching. This approach prioritizes fine-grained brand details (e.g., logos, on-screen text) while dynamically filtering out irrelevant background noise to isolate key protagonists. Second, the Structured Reasoning Agent mimics a marketing expert through an iterative inquiry loop, decomposing the narrative to deduce implicit persuasion tactics. Crucially, it employs an evidence-based self-correction mechanism that rigorously validates these insights against specific video frames, automatically backtracking when visual support is lacking. Evaluation on the AdsQA benchmark demonstrates that AD-MIR achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the strongest general-purpose agent, DVD, by 1.8% in strict and 9.5% in relaxed accuracy. These results underscore that effective advertising understanding demands explicitly grounding abstract marketing strategies in pixel-level evidence.

We show empirically that our proposed approach is significantly more efficient than existing similar approaches. Next, we utilize this approach to further obtain circuits that are tractable for computing the complete and general reasons of a decision, which are instance abstractions that play a fundamental role in computing explanations. Finally, we propose algorithms for computing the robustness of a decision and all shortest ways to flip it.

We propose ELM-INR, a backpropagation-free INR that decomposes the domain into overlapping subdomains and fits each local problem using an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) in closed form, replacing iterative optimization with stable linear least-squares solutions. This design yields fast and numerically robust reconstruction by combining local predictors through a partition of unity. To understand where approximation becomes difficult under fixed local capacity, we analyze the method from a spectral Barron norm perspective, which reveals that global reconstruction error is dominated by regions with high spectral complexity. Building on this insight, we introduce BEAM, an adaptive mesh refinement strategy that balances spectral complexity across subdomains to improve reconstruction quality in capacity-constrained regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\uff08INR\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5ELM-INR\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u57df\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u91cd\u53e0\u5b50\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5b50\u57df\u4e0a\u7528\u6781\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\uff08ELM\uff09\u95ed\u5f0f\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5355\u4f4d\u5206\u89e3\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u7a33\u5065\u91cd\u5efa\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4ece\u8c31Barron\u8303\u6570\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u8bef\u5dee\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7f51\u683c\u7ec6\u5316\u7b56\u7565BEAM\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5bb9\u91cf\u53d7\u9650\u4e0b\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fed\u4ee3\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\uff08INRs\uff09\u6613\u53d7\u9891\u8c31\u504f\u5dee\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u62df\u5408\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u975e\u5747\u5300\u9891\u7387\u6210\u5206\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faELM-INR\uff1a\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u57df\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u91cd\u53e0\u5b50\u57df\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5b50\u57df\u5185\u7528Extreme Learning Machine\uff08ELM\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u95ed\u5f0f\u7ebf\u6027\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u62df\u5408\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4f4d\u5206\u89e3\uff08partition of unity\uff09\u52a0\u6743\u878d\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u91c7\u7528\u8c31Barron\u8303\u6570\u523b\u753b\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u5e03\uff1b\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7f51\u683c\u7ec6\u5316\u7b56\u7565BEAM\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u3001\u5feb\u901f\u4e14\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684INR\u91cd\u5efa\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u63ed\u793a\u5168\u5c40\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u6e90\u4e8e\u9ad8\u8c31\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u533a\u57df\uff1bBEAM\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u5bb9\u91cf\u53d7\u9650\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "ELM-INR\u4e0eBEAM\u5171\u540c\u6784\u6210\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65b0\u578bINR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u9891\u8c31\u504f\u7f6e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002"}}

We decompose environments along five axes: scene (rural/urban), season, weather, time (day/night), and agent mix; and measure performance under controlled $k$-factor perturbations ($k \\in \\{0,1,2,3\\}$). Using closed loop control in VISTA, we benchmark FC, CNN, and ViT policies, train compact ViT heads on frozen foundation-model (FM) features, and vary ID support in scale, diversity, and temporal context. (1) ViT policies are markedly more OOD-robust than comparably sized CNN/FC, and FM features yield state-of-the-art success at a latency cost. (2) Naive temporal inputs (multi-frame) do not beat the best single-frame baseline. (3) The largest single factor drops are rural $\\rightarrow$ urban and day $\\rightarrow$ night ($\\sim 31\\%$ each); actor swaps $\\sim 10\\%$, moderate rain $\\sim 7\\%$; season shifts can be drastic, and combining a time flip with other changes further degrades performance. (4) FM-feature policies stay above $85\\%$ under three simultaneous changes; non-FM single-frame policies take a large first-shift hit, and all no-FM models fall below $50\\%$ by three changes. (5) Interactions are non-additive: some pairings partially offset, whereas season-time combinations are especially harmful. (6) Training on winter/snow is most robust to single-factor shifts, while a rural+summer baseline gives the best overall OOD performance. (7) Scaling traces/views improves robustness ($+11.8$ points from $5$ to $14$ traces), yet targeted exposure to hard conditions can substitute for scale. (8) Using multiple ID environments broadens coverage and strengthens weak cases (urban OOD $60.6\\% \\rightarrow 70.1\\%$) with a small ID drop; single-ID preserves peak performance but in a narrow domain. These results yield actionable design rules for OOD-robust driving policies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08\u573a\u666f\u3001\u5b63\u8282\u3001\u5929\u6c14\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ec4\u5408\uff09\u4e0a\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u53d7\u63a7\u7684k\u56e0\u5b50\u6270\u52a8\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\uff08FC\u3001CNN\u3001ViT\uff09\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08FM\uff09\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\uff08OOD\uff09\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u63d0\u5347OOD\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51c6\u5219\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5e38\u5c06OOD\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u6570\u503c\uff0c\u63a9\u76d6\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u5931\u6548\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u539f\u56e0\uff1b\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u89e3\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u6270\u52a8\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0b\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u5728VISTA\u4eff\u771f\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\u91c7\u7528\u95ed\u73af\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u6cbf\u573a\u666f\u3001\u5b63\u8282\u3001\u5929\u6c14\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6df7\u5408\u4e94\u7ef4\u8fdb\u884c0\u20133\u56e0\u5b50\u53d7\u63a7\u6270\u52a8\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1b\u5bf9\u6bd4FC\u3001CNN\u3001ViT\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u51bb\u7ed3\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5f81+\u8f7b\u91cfViT\u5934\u7684\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790ID\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "ViT\u4f18\u4e8e\u540c\u89c4\u6a21CNN/FC\uff1bFM\u7279\u5f81\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u56e0\u5b50OOD\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff08\u4e09\u56e0\u5b50\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u4ecd>85%\uff09\uff1b\u6700\u5927\u5355\u56e0\u5b50\u4e0b\u964d\u6765\u81ea\u519c\u6751\u2192\u57ce\u5e02\u548c\u767d\u5929\u2192\u9ed1\u591c\uff08\u5404~31%\uff09\uff1b\u56e0\u5b50\u4ea4\u4e92\u975e\u52a0\u6027\uff1b\u51ac\u5b63/\u96ea\u5929\u8bad\u7ec3\u6700\u6297\u5355\u56e0\u5b50\u6270\u52a8\uff1b\u589e\u52a0\u8f68\u8ff9/\u89c6\u89d2\u6570\u91cf\u6216\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u8986\u76d6\u56f0\u96be\u6761\u4ef6\u5747\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u591aID\u8bad\u7ec3\u62d3\u5bbd\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4f46\u7565\u964dID\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "OOD\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9700\u4ece\u591a\u7ef4\u6270\u52a8\u7ec4\u5408\u89d2\u5ea6\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1bViT\u67b6\u6784\u4e0eFM\u7279\u5f81\u662f\u5173\u952e\u589e\u76ca\u6765\u6e90\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff08\u591aID\u3001\u591a\u5b63\u8282\u3001\u591a\u573a\u666f\uff09\u6bd4\u5355\u7eaf\u6269\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff1b\u5e94\u907f\u514d\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u591a\u5e27\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u5148\u8986\u76d6\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u53d8\u5316\u7ec4\u5408\uff08\u5982\u5b63\u8282+\u65f6\u95f4\uff09\u3002"}}

However, human rubrics are often static and misaligned with how models internally represent language quality. We introduce GER-Eval (Generating Evaluation Rubrics for Evaluation) to investigate whether LLMs can design and apply their own evaluation rubrics. We evaluate the semantic coherence and scoring reliability of LLM-defined criteria and their alignment with human criteria. LLMs reliably generate interpretable and task-aware evaluation dimensions and apply them consistently within models, but their scoring reliability degrades in factual and knowledge-intensive settings. Closed-source models such as GPT-4o achieve higher agreement and cross-model generalization than open-weight models such as Llama.

Existing agent memory systems are typically designed within isolated paradigms (e.g., explicit, parametric, or latent memory) with tightly coupled retrieval methods that hinder cross-paradigm generalization and fusion. In this work, we take a first step toward unifying heterogeneous memory paradigms within a single memory system. We propose MemAdapter, a memory retrieval framework that enables fast alignment across agent memory paradigms. MemAdapter adopts a two-stage training strategy: (1) training a generative subgraph retriever from the unified memory space, and (2) adapting the retriever to unseen memory paradigms by training a lightweight alignment module through contrastive learning. This design improves the flexibility for memory retrieval and substantially reduces alignment cost across paradigms. Comprehensive experiments on three public evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that the generative subgraph retriever consistently outperforms five strong agent memory systems across three memory paradigms and agent model scales. Notably, MemAdapter completes cross-paradigm alignment within 13 minutes on a single GPU, achieving superior performance over original memory retrievers with less than 5% of training compute. Furthermore, MemAdapter enables effective zero-shot fusion across memory paradigms, highlighting its potential as a plug-and-play solution for agent memory systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMemAdapter\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u5f02\u6784\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u68c0\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5b50\u56fe\u68c0\u7d22\u5668+\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u5757\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u8303\u5f0f\u5feb\u901f\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u6781\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u5e38\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5b64\u7acb\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8303\u5f0f\uff08\u5982\u663e\u5f0f\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6216\u6f5c\u5728\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff09\uff0c\u5176\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u7d27\u5bc6\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u8303\u5f0f\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u878d\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMemAdapter\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1a(1) \u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5b50\u56fe\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\uff1b(2) \u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u9002\u914d\u672a\u89c1\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cMemAdapter\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5b50\u56fe\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8303\u5f0f\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5747\u6301\u7eed\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e94\u4e2a\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u5355GPU\u4ec5\u970013\u5206\u949f\u5b8c\u6210\u8de8\u8303\u5f0f\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u4e0d\u8db3\u539f\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u76845%\uff1b\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8de8\u8303\u5f0f\u878d\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "MemAdapter\u4e3aLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7edf\u4e00\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u5f02\u6784\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4e0e\u96c6\u6210\u3002"}}

To address the fundamental tension between batch decoding and expert sparsity, we present SERE, a Similarity-based Expert Re-routing method for Efficient batch decoding in MoE models. SERE dynamically reduces the number of active experts in an input-aware manner by re-routing tokens from secondary experts to their most similar primary counterparts. It also leverages similarity patterns to identify and preserve critical experts, thereby preventing capability loss. Notably, SERE avoids static expert pruning or merging, instead enabling dynamic expert skipping based on batch-level expert redundancy. Additionally, we provide an efficient custom CUDA kernel for SERE, enabling plug-and-play use in vLLM with only a single-line code change. Extensive experiments on various complex reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SERE achieves up to 2.0x speedup with minimal quality loss, providing a practical solution for cost-efficient and latency-sensitive large-scale MoE deployment.

However, we identify that the primary bottleneck to real-world robustness is not resource scale alone, but the distributional shift among the human demonstration distribution, the inductive bias learned by the policy, and the test-time execution distribution -- a systematic inconsistency that causes compounding errors in multi-stage tasks. To mitigate these inconsistencies, we propose $\u03c7_{0}$, a resource-efficient framework with effective modules designated to achieve production-level robustness in robotic manipulation. Our approach builds off three technical pillars: (i) Model Arithmetic, a weight-space merging strategy that efficiently soaks up diverse distributions of different demonstrations, varying from object appearance to state variations; (ii) Stage Advantage, a stage-aware advantage estimator that provides stable, dense progress signals, overcoming the numerical instability of prior non-stage approaches; and (iii) Train-Deploy Alignment, which bridges the distribution gap via spatio-temporal augmentation, heuristic DAgger corrections, and temporal chunk-wise smoothing. $\u03c7_{0}$ enables two sets of dual-arm robots to collaboratively orchestrate long-horizon garment manipulation, spanning tasks from flattening, folding, to hanging different clothes. Our method exhibits high-reliability autonomy; we are able to run the system from arbitrary initial state for consecutive 24 hours non-stop. Experiments validate that $\u03c7_{0}$ surpasses the state-of-the-art $\u03c0_{0.5}$ in success rate by nearly 250%, with only 20-hour data and 8 A100 GPUs.

Current approaches often rely on unreliable LLMs for safety checks or simply reject unsafe plans without offering repairs.

Our core contribution is a tutor-apprentice dialogue where a deterministic Logic Tutor, grounded in a formal safety ontology, provides causal and pedagogical feedback to an LLM planner. This enables intelligent plan repairs rather than mere avoidance. We also introduce a scalable knowledge acquisition pipeline that synthesizes safety knowledge bases from real-world documents, correcting blind spots in existing benchmarks. In challenging home safety tasks, VIRF achieves a perfect 0 percent Hazardous Action Rate (HAR) and a 77.3 percent Goal-Condition Rate (GCR), which is the highest among all baselines.

We consider ReLU neural networks subject to natural constraints on weights and input and output dimensions, which model a notion of dense connectivity.

While online reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in improving general foundation models, applying RL to VLA manipulation in real-world settings is still hindered by low exploration efficiency and a restricted exploration space. Through systematic real-world experiments, we observe that the effective exploration space of online RL is closely tied to the data distribution of supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Motivated by this observation, we propose TwinRL, a digital twin-real-world collaborative RL framework designed to scale and guide exploration for VLA models. First, a high-fidelity digital twin is efficiently reconstructed from smartphone-captured scenes, enabling realistic bidirectional transfer between real and simulated environments. During the SFT warm-up stage, we introduce an exploration space expansion strategy using digital twins to broaden the support of the data trajectory distribution. Building on this enhanced initialization, we propose a sim-to-real guided exploration strategy to further accelerate online RL. Specifically, TwinRL performs efficient and parallel online RL in the digital twin prior to deployment, effectively bridging the gap between offline and online training stages. Subsequently, we exploit efficient digital twin sampling to identify failure-prone yet informative configurations, which are used to guide targeted human-in-the-loop rollouts on the real robot. In our experiments, TwinRL approaches 100% success in both in-distribution regions covered by real-world demonstrations and out-of-distribution regions, delivering at least a 30% speedup over prior real-world RL methods and requiring only about 20 minutes on average across four tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faTwinRL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u534f\u540c\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08VLA\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VLA\u6a21\u578b\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u4e13\u5bb6\u6f14\u793a\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b\u5728\u7ebfRL\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u63a2\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u6709\u6548\u63a2\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTwinRL\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u624b\u673a\u62cd\u6444\u573a\u666f\u9ad8\u6548\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u865a\u5b9e\u53cc\u5411\u8fc1\u79fb\uff1b2\uff09\u5728SFT\u9884\u70ed\u9636\u6bb5\u5229\u7528\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6269\u5c55\u8f68\u8ff9\u5206\u5e03\u4ee5\u6269\u5927\u63a2\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b3\uff09\u91c7\u7528sim-to-real\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a2\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u2014\u2014\u5148\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u4e2d\u5e76\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u5f00\u5c55\u5728\u7ebfRL\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u91c7\u6837\u8bc6\u522b\u6613\u5931\u8d25\u4f46\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u7684\u4eba\u5728\u73af rollout\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u9879\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cTwinRL\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u533a\u57df\u5747\u63a5\u8fd1100%\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754cRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u901f\u81f3\u5c1130%\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6bcf\u4efb\u52a1\u4ec5\u9700\u7ea620\u5206\u949f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u6865\u63a5\u79bb\u7ebf\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0cTwinRL\u4e3a\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3001\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754cVLA\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

This work evaluates the errors across the reconstruction pipeline and explores the use of voxel and surface-based accuracy metrics for different segmentation algorithms and geometry types. A sphere, a facemask, and an AAA were printed using the SLA technique and scanned using a micro-CT machine. Segmentation was performed using GMM, Otsu and RG based methods. Segmented and reference models aligned using the KU algorithm, were quantitatively compared to evaluate metrics like Dice and Jaccard scores, precision. Surface meshes were registered with reference meshes using an ICP-based alignment process. Metrics like chamfer distance, and average Hausdorff distance were evaluated. The Otsu method was found to be the most suitable method for all the geometries. AAA yielded low overlap scores due to its small wall thickness and misalignment. The effect of class imbalance on specificity was observed the most for AAA. Surface-based accuracy metrics differed from the voxel-based trends. The RG method performed best for sphere, while GMM and Otsu perform better for AAA. The facemask surface was most error-prone, possibly due to misalignment during the ICP process. Segmentation accuracy is a cumulative sum of errors across different stages of the reconstruction process. High voxel-based accuracy metrics may be misleading in cases of high class imbalance and sensitivity to alignment. The Jaccard index is found to be more stringent than the Dice and more suitable for accuracy assessment for thin-walled structures. Voxel and point cloud alignment should be ensured to make any reliable assessment of the reconstruction pipeline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u533b\u5b66\u626b\u63cf3D\u91cd\u5efa\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5404\u73af\u8282\uff08\u6210\u50cf\u3001\u5206\u5272\u3001\u914d\u51c6\u3001\u7f51\u683c\u5904\u7406\uff09\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f53\u7d20\u548c\u8868\u9762\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u7403\u4f53\u3001\u9762\u7f69\u3001\u8179\u4e3b\u52a8\u8109\u7624AAA\uff09\u548c\u5206\u5272\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08GMM\u3001Otsu\u3001RG\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0Otsu\u6cd5\u6574\u4f53\u6700\u4f18\uff0cJaccard\u6307\u6570\u66f4\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8584\u58c1\u7ed3\u6784\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e14\u914d\u51c6\u8d28\u91cf\u5bf9\u7ed3\u679c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "motivation": "3D\u533b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u53d7\u786c\u4ef6\u3001\u5206\u5272\u4e0e\u7f51\u683c\u5904\u7406\u7b49\u591a\u73af\u8282\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f46\u51e0\u4f55\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u3001\u4f53\u7d20/\u70b9\u4e91\u914d\u51c6\u5bf9\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528SLA\u6253\u5370\u6807\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u7403\u4f53\u3001\u9762\u7f69\u3001AAA\uff09\uff0c\u7ecfmicro-CT\u626b\u63cf\u540e\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u7528GMM\u3001Otsu\u548cRG\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5272\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528KU\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4f53\u7d20\u914d\u51c6\uff0cICP\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u8868\u9762\u914d\u51c6\uff1b\u5bf9\u6bd4Dice\u3001Jaccard\u3001\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001Chamfer\u8ddd\u79bb\u3001\u5e73\u5747Hausdorff\u8ddd\u79bb\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "Otsu\u6cd5\u5728\u6240\u6709\u51e0\u4f55\u4f53\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff1bAAA\u56e0\u58c1\u8584\u548c\u914d\u51c6\u504f\u5dee\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u53e0\u5206\u6570\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e14\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5176\u7279\u5f02\u6027\uff1bRG\u5728\u7403\u4f53\u4e0a\u6700\u4f18\uff0cGMM/Otsu\u5728AAA\u4e0a\u66f4\u4f18\uff1b\u9762\u7f69\u8868\u9762\u8bef\u5dee\u6700\u5927\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u6e90\u4e8eICP\u914d\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\uff1b\u4f53\u7d20\u4e0e\u8868\u9762\u6307\u6807\u8d8b\u52bf\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff1bJaccard\u6bd4Dice\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\uff0c\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u8584\u58c1\u7ed3\u6784\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u662f\u91cd\u5efa\u5168\u6d41\u7a0b\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u4f53\u73b0\uff1b\u9ad8\u4f53\u7d20\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u5728\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6216\u914d\u51c6\u654f\u611f\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u5177\u6709\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\uff1b\u53ef\u9760\u8bc4\u4f30\u5fc5\u987b\u786e\u4fdd\u4f53\u7d20\u4e0e\u70b9\u4e91\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u914d\u51c6\uff1bJaccard\u6307\u6570\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8584\u58c1\u7ed3\u6784\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002"}}

In distributed and access-restricted settings (e.g., hospitals or multinational organizations), retrieval must select relevant domains and appropriate traversal depth without global graph visibility or exhaustive querying. To address this challenge, we introduce \\textbf{SCOUT-RAG} (\\textit{\\underline{S}calable and \\underline{CO}st-efficient \\underline{U}nifying \\underline{T}raversal}), a distributed agentic Graph-RAG framework that performs progressive cross-domain retrieval guided by incremental utility goals. SCOUT-RAG employs four cooperative agents that: (i) estimate domain relevance, (ii) decide when to expand retrieval to additional domains, (iii) adapt traversal depth to avoid unnecessary graph exploration, and (iv) synthesize the high-quality answers. The framework is designed to minimize retrieval regret, defined as missing useful domain information, while controlling latency and API cost. Across multi-domain knowledge settings, SCOUT-RAG achieves performance comparable to centralized baselines, including DRIFT and exhaustive domain traversal, while substantially reducing cross-domain calls, total tokens processed, and latency.", "AI": {"tldr": "SCOUT-RAG\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u3001\u53d7\u9650\u8bbf\u95ee\u73af\u5883\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u56fe\u589e\u5f3a\u68c0\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u4e2a\u534f\u540c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b9e\u73b0\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u8de8\u57df\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8c03\u7528\u6b21\u6570\u3001\u4ee4\u724c\u6d88\u8017\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u533b\u9662\u6216\u8de8\u56fd\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7b49\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4e14\u8bbf\u95ee\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u7684Graph-RAG\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5168\u5c40\u56fe\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u9ad8\u6548\u9009\u62e9\u76f8\u5173\u9886\u57df\u4e0e\u904d\u5386\u6df1\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSCOUT-RAG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u56db\u4e2a\u534f\u540c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff1a\u9886\u57df\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u3001\u8de8\u57df\u6269\u5c55\u51b3\u7b56\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u904d\u5386\u6df1\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u7b54\u6848\u5408\u6210\uff1b\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u2018\u68c0\u7d22\u9057\u61be\u2019\uff08\u9057\u6f0f\u6709\u7528\u9886\u57df\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0eAPI\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0cSCOUT-RAG\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u57fa\u7ebf\uff08\u5982DRIFT\u548c\u7a77\u4e3e\u904d\u5386\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u8de8\u57df\u8c03\u7528\u6b21\u6570\u3001\u603b\u5904\u7406token\u6570\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "conclusion": "SCOUT-RAG\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u56fe\u589e\u5f3a\u68c0\u7d22\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u6548\u679c\u3001\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u65f6\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

We demonstrate that these systems are highly vulnerable to imitation attacks, where adversaries steal proprietary capabilities by training imitation models on victim outputs. Crucially, existing LLM watermarking techniques fail in this domain because real-world agentic systems often operate as grey boxes, concealing the internal reasoning traces required for verification. This paper presents AGENTWM, the first watermarking framework designed specifically for agentic models. AGENTWM exploits the semantic equivalence of action sequences, injecting watermarks by subtly biasing the distribution of functionally identical tool execution paths. This mechanism allows AGENTWM to embed verifiable signals directly into the visible action trajectory while remaining indistinguishable to users.

This paper investigates how vision-language representations support driving scene safety assessment and decision-making when integrated into perception, prediction, and planning pipelines. We study three complementary system-level use cases. First, we introduce a lightweight, category-agnostic hazard screening approach leveraging CLIP-based image-text similarity to produce a low-latency semantic hazard signal. This enables robust detection of diverse and out-of-distribution road hazards without explicit object detection or visual question answering. Second, we examine the integration of scene-level vision-language embeddings into a transformer-based trajectory planning framework using the Waymo Open Dataset. Our results show that naively conditioning planners on global embeddings does not improve trajectory accuracy, highlighting the importance of representation-task alignment and motivating the development of task-informed extraction methods for safety-critical planning. Third, we investigate natural language as an explicit behavioral constraint on motion planning using the doScenes dataset. In this setting, passenger-style instructions grounded in visual scene elements suppress rare but severe planning failures and improve safety-aligned behavior in ambiguous scenarios. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that vision-language representations hold significant promise for autonomous driving safety when used to express semantic risk, intent, and behavioral constraints.

To address this gap, we propose Personalized Agent Security Bench (PASB), an end-to-end security evaluation framework tailored for real-world personalized agents. Building upon existing agent attack paradigms, PASB incorporates personalized usage scenarios, realistic toolchains, and long-horizon interactions, enabling black-box, end-to-end security evaluation on real systems. Using OpenClaw as a representative case study, we systematically evaluate its security across multiple personalized scenarios, tool capabilities, and attack types. Our results indicate that OpenClaw exhibits critical vulnerabilities at different execution stages, including user prompt processing, tool usage, and memory retrieval, highlighting substantial security risks in personalized agent deployments.

Preprint. Code: https://github.com/jbarnes850/test-time-training", "summary": "Test-time training (TTT) adapts language models through gradient-based updates at inference. But is adaptation the right strategy? We study compute-optimal test-time strategies for verifiable execution-grounded (VEG) tasks, domains like GPU kernel optimization where a deterministic evaluator provides dense, continuous reward signals. Using KernelBench as our testbed and a 120B-parameter model (GPT-OSS-120B with LoRA adaptation), we find that search outperforms minimal adaptation (1-5 gradient steps): Best-of-N sampling achieves 90% task success (18/20 tasks) at K=64 across the full KernelBench L1 eval set while TTT's best checkpoint reaches only 30.6% (3-seed mean), with TTT's \"equivalent K\" falling below 1, worse than single-sample inference. The failure mode is over-sharpening: gradient updates collapse diversity toward mediocre solutions rather than discovering optimal ones. Our main contribution is surprisal-guided selection: selecting the highest-surprisal (lowest-confidence) correct sample yields 80% success vs. 50% for most-confident selection, a 30% improvement. Extending to surprisal-guided-top3 matches oracle performance at 100%. This zero-cost strategy, validated through length-controlled analysis, recovers oracle performance. For dense-reward VEG tasks, compute should be allocated to sample diversity and intelligent selection rather than gradient adaptation. The surprisal-guided selection principle may generalize to other execution-grounded domains where optimal solutions occupy the distribution tail.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6267\u884c\u57fa\u7840\uff08VEG\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08TTT\uff09\u662f\u5426\u662f\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u641c\u7d22\uff08\u5982Best-of-N\u91c7\u6837\uff09\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5c11\u91cf\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u7684TTT\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u201c\u60ca\u5947\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\u9009\u62e9\u201d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e0b\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5bf9VEG\u4efb\u52a1\u5e94\u4f18\u5148\u5206\u914d\u7b97\u529b\u4e8e\u6837\u672c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u68af\u5ea6\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d28\u7591\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08TTT\uff09\u5728\u5177\u6709\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u7a20\u5bc6\u8fde\u7eed\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6267\u884c\u57fa\u7840\uff08VEG\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982GPU\u6838\u4f18\u5316\uff09\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u4e3a\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u4ee5KernelBench\u4e3a\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528120B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\uff08GPT-OSS-120B+LoRA\uff09\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4TTT\uff081\u20135\u6b65\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\uff09\u4e0eBest-of-N\u91c7\u6837\u7b49\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u60ca\u5947\u5ea6\uff08surprisal\uff09\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\u2014\u2014\u4f18\u5148\u9009\u53d6\u6b63\u786e\u4f46\u4f4e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff08\u9ad8\u60ca\u5947\u5ea6\uff09\u7684\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u81f3top-3\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "result": "Best-of-64\u91c7\u6837\u8fbe90%\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u800cTTT\u6700\u9ad8\u4ec530.6%\uff1b\u60ca\u5947\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\u5355\u6837\u672c\u9009\u62e9\u8fbe80%\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff08\u8f83\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6700\u9ad8\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u534730%\uff09\uff0c\u60ca\u5947\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfctop-3\u9009\u62e9\u8fbe100%\uff08\u5339\u914doracle\u6027\u80fd\uff09\uff1bTTT\u56e0\u2018\u8fc7\u5ea6\u9510\u5316\u2019\u635f\u5bb3\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7a20\u5bc6\u5956\u52b1\u7684VEG\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u5e94\u6295\u5411\u6837\u672c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u60ca\u5947\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u68af\u5ea6\u9002\u5e94\uff1b\u8be5\u9009\u62e9\u539f\u5219\u53ef\u80fd\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u5176\u4ed6\u6267\u884c\u57fa\u7840\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5f53\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u4f4d\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u5c3e\u90e8\u65f6\u3002"}}

Yet this characteristic has not been carefully examined in the LLM research community and remains absent from most alignment studies. Debate-oriented sources provide a natural entry point for pluralism research. Previous work builds on online debate sources but remains constrained by costly human validation. Other debate-rich platforms such as Reddit and Kialo also offer promising material: Reddit provides linguistic diversity and scale but lacks clear argumentative structure, while Kialo supplies explicit pro/con graphs but remains overly concise and detached from natural discourse. We introduce PERSPECTRA, a pluralist benchmark that integrates the structural clarity of Kialo debate graphs with the linguistic diversity of real Reddit discussions. Using a controlled retrieval-and-expansion pipeline, we construct 3,810 enriched arguments spanning 762 pro/con stances on 100 controversial topics. Each opinion is expanded to multiple naturalistic variants, enabling robust evaluation of pluralism.

PoT interleaves (i) temporal evidence selection, (ii) step-wise state updates, and (iii) constrained answer synthesis, enabling the model to progressively refine hypotheses while maintaining traceability to video evidence. The framework is designed to be model-agnostic and can be plugged into existing vision-language backbones, supporting both closed-book reasoning and evidence-augmented reasoning with external tools.

This assumption becomes fragile for agents with situational awareness, which may exploitregime leakage-informational cues distinguishing evaluation from deployment-to implement conditional policies such as sycophancy and sleeper agents, which preserve compliance under oversight while defecting in deployment-like regimes. We reframe alignment evaluation as a problem of information flow under partial observability. Within this framework, we show that divergence between evaluation-time and deployment-time behavior is bounded by the mutual information between internal representations and the regime variable. Motivated by this result, we study regime-blind mechanisms: training-time interventions that reduce the extractability of regime information at decision-relevant internal representations via adversarial invariance. We evaluate this approach on a base, open-weight language model across two fully characterized failure modes -scientific sycophancy and temporal sleeper agents. Regime-blind training suppresses regime-conditioned behavior in both evaluated cases without measurable loss of task utility, but with qualitatively different dynamics: sycophancy exhibits a sharp representational and behavioral transition at low intervention strength, whereas sleeper-agent behavior requires substantially stronger pressure and does not exhibit a clean collapse of regime decodability. These results demonstrate that representational invariance is a meaningful but fundamentally limited control lever, whose effectiveness depends on how regime information is embedded in the policy. We argue that behavioral evaluation should be complemented with white-box diagnostics of regime awareness and information flow.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5177\u5907\u60c5\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u4e2d\u53ef\u63d0\u53d6\u7684'\u573a\u666f\u4fe1\u606f'\uff08evaluation vs. deployment\uff09\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u9f50\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u79d1\u5b66\u8c04\u5a9a\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u578b\u4f11\u7720\u4ee3\u7406\u4e24\u79cd\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u53ca\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709AI\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u5047\u8bbe\u8bc4\u4f30\u65f6\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u5177\u5907\u60c5\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u53ef\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u90e8\u7f72\u95f4\u7684\u7ec6\u5fae\u4fe1\u606f\u5dee\u5f02\uff08regime leakage\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u65bd\u5982\u8c04\u5a9a\u6216\u4f11\u7720\u4ee3\u7406\u7b49\u6761\u4ef6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u5408\u89c4\u3001\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u80cc\u53db\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bc4\u4f30\u5931\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bc4\u4f30\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0b\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u884c\u4e3a\u504f\u5dee\u53d7\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u4e0e\u573a\u666f\u53d8\u91cf\u95f4\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b\u8fdb\u800c\u63d0\u51fa'\u573a\u666f\u76f2\u673a\u5236'\u2014\u2014\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6297\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\u51b3\u7b56\u76f8\u5173\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u4e2d\u573a\u666f\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u7801\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5f00\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u79d1\u5b66\u8c04\u5a9a\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u578b\u4f11\u7720\u4ee3\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u4f46\u4e8c\u8005\u54cd\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\uff1a\u8c04\u5a9a\u5728\u5f31\u5e72\u9884\u4e0b\u5373\u53d1\u751f\u8868\u5f81\u4e0e\u884c\u4e3a\u7a81\u53d8\uff0c\u800c\u4f11\u7720\u4ee3\u7406\u9700\u66f4\u5f3a\u5e72\u9884\u4e14\u65e0\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4fe1\u606f\u89e3\u7801\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8868\u5f81\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u4f46\u672c\u8d28\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u5176\u6548\u679c\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u573a\u666f\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u4e2d\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u5f0f\uff1b\u5e94\u5c06\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u9488\u5bf9\u573a\u666f\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u7684\u767d\u76d2\u8bca\u65ad\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002"}}

Existing methods often fail to address distribution shift across clients and distribution drift over time, or they rely on unrealistic assumptions such as known number of client clusters and data heterogeneity types, which limits their generalizability. We introduce Feroma, a novel FL framework that explicitly handles both distribution shift and drift without relying on client or cluster identity. Feroma builds on client distribution profiles-compact, privacy-preserving representations of local data-that guide model aggregation and test-time model assignment through adaptive similarity-based weighting. This design allows Feroma to dynamically select aggregation strategies during training, ranging from clustered to personalized, and deploy suitable models to unseen, and unlabeled test clients without retraining, online adaptation, or prior knowledge on clients' data. Extensive experiments show that compared to 10 state-of-the-art methods, Feroma improves performance and stability under dynamic data heterogeneity conditions-an average accuracy gain of up to 12 percentage points over the best baselines across 6 benchmarks-while maintaining computational and communication overhead comparable to FedAvg. These results highlight that distribution-profile-based aggregation offers a practical path toward robust FL under both data distribution shifts and drifts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFeroma\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5206\u5e03\u6982\u8981\uff08distribution profiles\uff09\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6216\u805a\u7c7b\u6807\u8bc6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u95f4\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\uff08distribution shift\uff09\u548c\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u6f02\u79fb\uff08distribution drift\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u73b0\u5b9e\u5047\u8bbe\uff08\u5982\u5df2\u77e5\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u805a\u7c7b\u6570\u6216\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u7c7b\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFeroma\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u578b\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5206\u5e03\u6982\u8981\uff08client distribution profiles\uff09\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u805a\u5408\u4e0e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u914d\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u52a0\u6743\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u4ece\u805a\u7c7b\u5230\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u3001\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u76f4\u63a5\u90e8\u7f72\u5408\u9002\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u5728\u7ebf\u9002\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u57286\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd410\u79cdSOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cFeroma\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe12\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u4e0eFedAvg\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u6982\u8981\u7684\u805a\u5408\u673a\u5236\u4e3a\u5e94\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0e\u6f02\u79fb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

This task is particularly challenging due to the highly unstructured environment: coal and gangue are randomly piled, backgrounds are complex and variable, and foreign objects often exhibit low contrast, deformation, occlusion, resulting in coupling with their surroundings. These characteristics weaken the stability and regularity assumptions that many anomaly detection methods rely on in structured industrial settings, leading to notable performance degradation. To support evaluation and comparison in this setting, we construct \\textbf{CoalAD}, a benchmark for unsupervised foreign-object anomaly detection with pixel-level localization in coal-stream scenes. We further propose a complementary-cue collaborative perception framework that extracts and fuses complementary anomaly evidence from three perspectives: object-level semantic composition modeling, semantic-attribution-based global deviation analysis, and fine-grained texture matching. The fused outputs provide robust image-level anomaly scoring and accurate pixel-level localization. Experiments on CoalAD demonstrate that our method outperforms widely used baselines across the evaluated image-level and pixel-level metrics, and ablation studies validate the contribution of each component.

The natural properties of Tensor, especially the memory-continuity and slice-independence, make it feasible for training system to leverage parallel computing unit like GPU to process data simultaneously in batch, spatial or temporal dimensions. However, if we look beyond perception tasks, the data in a complicated cognitive AI system usually has hierarchical structures (i.e. nested data) with various modalities. They are inconvenient and inefficient to program directly with conventional Tensor with fixed shape. To address this issue, we summarize two main computational patterns of nested data, and then propose a general nested data container: TreeTensor. Through various constraints and magic utilities of TreeTensor, one can apply arbitrary functions and operations to nested data with almost zero cost, including some famous machine learning libraries, such as Scikit-Learn, Numpy and PyTorch. Our approach utilizes a constrained tree-structure perspective to systematically model data relationships, and it can also easily be combined with other methods to extend more usages, such as asynchronous execution and variable-length data computation. Detailed examples and benchmarks show TreeTensor not only provides powerful usability in various problems, especially one of the most complicated AI systems at present: AlphaStar for StarCraftII, but also exhibits excellent runtime efficiency without any overhead.

Algorithmic recourse provides actionable input modifications to achieve more favorable outcomes, typically relying on counterfactual explanations to suggest such changes. However, when the Rashomon set - the set of near-optimal models - is large, standard counterfactual explanations can become unreliable, as a recourse action valid for one model may fail under another. We introduce ElliCE, a novel framework for robust algorithmic recourse that optimizes counterfactuals over an ellipsoidal approximation of the Rashomon set. The resulting explanations are provably valid over this ellipsoid, with theoretical guarantees on uniqueness, stability, and alignment with key feature directions. Empirically, ElliCE generates counterfactuals that are not only more robust but also more flexible, adapting to user-specified feature constraints while being substantially faster than existing baselines. This provides a principled and practical solution for reliable recourse under model uncertainty, ensuring stable recommendations for users even as models evolve.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faElliCE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728Rashomon\u96c6\u7684\u692d\u7403\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e0a\u4f18\u5316\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6551\u6d4e\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u89e3\u91ca\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u552f\u4e00\u6027\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53Rashomon\u96c6\u8f83\u5927\u65f6\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8fd1\u4f18\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u6551\u6d4e\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8eRashomon\u96c6\u692d\u7403\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6ElliCE\uff0c\u5bf9\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8fdb\u884c\u9c81\u68d2\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u969c\uff08\u552f\u4e00\u6027\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\u65b9\u5411\u5bf9\u9f50\uff09\u3002", "result": "ElliCE\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff08\u652f\u6301\u7528\u6237\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u7ea6\u675f\uff09\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ElliCE\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u7b97\u6cd5\u6551\u6d4e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u7406\u6e05\u6670\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u7528\u6237\u83b7\u5f97\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u7684\u884c\u52a8\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

This regime can systematically under-estimate a fixed model's true capability: many errors arise not from missing knowledge, but from premature commitment under internal ambiguity. We introduce \\emph{Reinforcement Inference}, an entropy-aware inference-time control strategy that uses the model's own uncertainty to selectively invoke a second, more deliberate reasoning attempt, enabling stronger performance \\emph{without any retraining}.\n  On 12,032 MMLU-Pro questions across 14 subjects, using DeepSeek-v3.2 with deterministic decoding in a zero-shot setting, Reinforcement Inference improves accuracy from 60.72\\% to 84.03\\%, while only incurring 61.06\\% additional inference calls. A 100\\% re-asking ablation reaches 84.35\\%, indicating that uncertainty-aware selection captures most of the attainable improvement with substantially less compute. Moreover, a \\emph{prompt-only} ablation underperforms the baseline, suggesting that the gains are not explained by generic `` your output had high entropy, think step-by-step'' prompting alone.\n  Beyond providing a practical inference-time upgrade, our results suggest a broader \\emph{entropy-aware} paradigm for measuring and expanding model capability: because modern decoder-based models generate outputs autoregressively, entropy and related confidence measures arise naturally as first-class control signals during generation. The resulting gap between one-pass greedy inference and uncertainty-conditioned deliberation offers a diagnostic lens on an LLM's latent reasoning horizon and motivates future training objectives that explicitly constrain correctness--confidence alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a'Reinforcement Inference'\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff08\u71b5\uff09\u6765\u52a8\u6001\u51b3\u5b9a\u662f\u5426\u5bf9\u9ad8\u71b5\u8f93\u51fa\u8fdb\u884c\u4e8c\u6b21\u3001\u66f4\u5ba1\u614e\u7684\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4e0d\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u6b21\u8d2a\u5a6a\u89e3\u7801\u4f1a\u4f4e\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u771f\u5b9e\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u9519\u8bef\u6e90\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u65f6\u8fc7\u65e9\u786e\u5b9a\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f3a\u5931\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa'Reinforcement Inference'\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u3001\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u89e3\u7801\u4e0b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u6bcf\u6b65\u751f\u6210\u7684\u71b5\u52a8\u6001\u5224\u65ad\u662f\u5426\u89e6\u53d1\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6b21\u63a8\u7406\uff1b\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u6216\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728MMLU-Pro\uff0812,032\u9898\uff0c14\u5b66\u79d1\uff09\u4e0a\uff0cDeepSeek-v3.2\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece60.72%\u63d0\u5347\u81f384.03%\uff0c\u4ec5\u589e\u52a061.06%\u63a8\u7406\u8c03\u7528\uff1b\u5168\u91cd\u95ee\uff08100% re-asking\uff09\u8fbe84.35%\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u71b5\u611f\u77e5\u9009\u62e9\u9ad8\u6548\uff1b\u7eaf\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u6392\u9664\u4e86\u5355\u7eaf\u63d0\u793a\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u71b5\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u4e00\u7b49\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b'\u4e00\u6b21\u8d2a\u5a6a\u89e3\u7801'\u4e0e'\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5ba1\u614e\u63a8\u7406'\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u5982\u6b63\u786e\u6027-\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

This tension is exposed by spline-based Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) parameterizations, where grid refinement can induce parameter growth and brittle optimization in high dimensions. To propose a stability-preserving way to inject spectral capacity into existing MLP/FFN layers under fixed parameter and training budgets, we introduce Spectral Gating Networks (SGN), a drop-in spectral reparameterization. SGN augments a standard activation pathway with a compact spectral pathway and learnable gates that allow the model to start from a stable base behavior and progressively allocate capacity to spectral features during training. The spectral pathway is instantiated with trainable Random Fourier Features (learned frequencies and phases), replacing grid-based splines and removing resolution dependence. A hybrid GELU-Fourier formulation further improves optimization robustness while enhancing high-frequency fidelity. Across vision, NLP, audio, and PDE benchmarks, SGN consistently improves accuracy-efficiency trade-offs under comparable computational budgets, achieving 93.15% accuracy on CIFAR-10 and up to 11.7x faster inference than spline-based KAN variants.

To fill this gap, this paper proposes affective flow language model for emotional support conversation (AFlow), a framework that introduces fine-grained supervision on dialogue prefixes by modeling a continuous affective flow along multi-turn trajectories. AFlow can estimate intermediate utility over searched trajectories and learn preference-consistent strategy transitions. To improve strategy coherence and empathetic response quality, a subpath-level flow-balance objective is presented to propagate preference signals to intermediate states. Experiment results show consistent and significant improvements over competitive baselines in diverse emotional contexts.

Conventional approaches predominantly rely on deep neural networks (DNNs), which incur high energy costs due to extensive analog-to-digital conversions and large-scale image computations required for low-latency, real-time responses. Diffractive optical neural networks (DONNs) have shown promising advantages over conventional DNNs on digital or optoelectronic computing platforms in energy efficiency. By performing all-optical image processing via light diffraction at the speed of light, DONNs save computation energy costs while reducing the overhead associated with analog-to-digital conversions by all-optical encoding and computing. In this work, we propose a novel all-optical computing framework for RGB image segmentation and lane detection in autonomous driving applications. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the DONN system for image segmentation on the CityScapes dataset.

To address these, we propose a novel long-horizon RL framework integrating online personalization with Adaptive Tree-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (AT-GRPO). Adopting a two-agent game paradigm, a user agent constructs dynamic environments via style mimicry (learning user-specific conversational traits) and active termination (predicting turn-level termination probabilities as immediate rewards), forming an iterative cycle that drives the dialogue agent to deepen interest exploration. AT-GRPO reinterprets dialogue trajectories as trees and introduces adaptive observation ranges. Unlike full tree expansion that incurs exponential overhead, it limits each node to aggregate rewards from a stage-aware range: larger ranges support early-stage topic exploration, while smaller ranges facilitate late-stage dialogue maintenance. This design reduces rollout budgets from exponential to polynomial in the dialogue length, while preserving long-term reward capture.

Recent work has improved the training stability of deep PC networks (PCNs) by leveraging some BP-inspired reparameterisations. However, the full scalability and theoretical basis of these approaches remains unclear. To address this, we study the infinite width and depth limits of PCNs. For linear residual networks, we show that the set of width- and depth-stable feature-learning parameterisations for PC is exactly the same as for BP. Moreover, under any of these parameterisations, the PC energy with equilibrated activities converges to the BP loss in a regime where the model width is much larger than the depth, resulting in PC computing the same gradients as BP. Experiments show that these results hold in practice for deep nonlinear networks, as long as an activity equilibrium seem to be reached.

With the widespread deployment of LLMs, in-the-wild interactions have emerged as a rich source of implicit reward signals. This raises the question: Can we develop reward models directly from in-the-wild interactions? In this work, we explore this possibility by adopting WildChat as an interaction source and proposing a pipeline to extract reliable human feedback, yielding 186k high-quality instances for training WildReward via ordinal regression directly on user feedback without preference pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WildReward achieves comparable or even superior performance compared to conventional reward models, with improved calibration and cross-sample consistency.

However, existing approaches remain largely heuristic, lacking principled guidance on what drives performance gains and how to systematically optimize multi-agent reasoning. Specifically, it remains unclear why multi-agent collaboration outperforms single-agent reasoning and which design choices contribute most to these gains, making it difficult to build better systems.\n  We address this gap by introducing a unified theoretical framework that decomposes multi-agent reasoning gains into three conceptually independent dimensions: Exploration for diverse solution coverage, Information for high-fidelity feedback, and Aggregation for principled consensus. Through this lens, existing methods can be understood as special cases that optimize only subsets of these dimensions. Building upon this decomposition, a novel framework called PRISM (Propose-Review-Integrate Synthesis for Multi-agent Reasoning) is proposed, which jointly maximizes all three dimensions through role-based diversity, execution-grounded feedback with evidence-based cross-evaluation, and iterative synthesis with closed-loop validation. Extensive experiments across mathematical reasoning, code generation, and function calling benchmarks demonstrate that PRISM achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior compute-efficiency compared to methods optimizing partial dimensions. The theoretical framework provides actionable design principles for future multi-agent reasoning systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u76ca\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u805a\u5408\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PRISM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f55\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u4ee5\u53ca\u54ea\u4e9b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5173\u952e\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u76ca\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\uff08Exploration\uff09\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\uff08Information\uff09\u548c\u805a\u5408\uff08Aggregation\uff09\u4e09\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff1b\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u8bbe\u8ba1PRISM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89d2\u8272\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u6267\u884c\u9a71\u52a8\u53cd\u9988\u4e0e\u8bc1\u636e\u4ea4\u53c9\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u8fed\u4ee3\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u95ed\u73af\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u4e09\u8005\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u548c\u51fd\u6570\u8c03\u7528\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cPRISM\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4f18\u5316\u90e8\u5206\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u4ece\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5411\u539f\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002"}}

While effective for individual prediction problems, this paradigm underutilizes the rich structure of clinical data and limits the transferability, stability, and interpretability of learned features. In this work, we propose dense feature learning, a representation centric framework that explicitly shapes the linear structure of medical embeddings. Our approach operates directly on embedding matrices, encouraging spectral balance, subspace consistency, and feature orthogonality through objectives defined entirely in terms of linear algebraic properties. Without relying on labels or generative reconstruction, dense feature learning produces representations with higher effective rank, improved conditioning, and greater stability across time. Empirical evaluations across longitudinal EHR data, clinical text, and multimodal patient representations demonstrate consistent improvements in downstream linear performance, robustness, and subspace alignment compared to supervised and self supervised baselines.

However, prior work is primarily evaluated on natural-language benchmarks using task-level metrics, where token-level difficulty is unobservable and confounded with architectural factors, making it unclear whether compute allocation truly aligns with underlying complexity. We address this gap through three contributions. First, we introduce a complexity-controlled evaluation paradigm using algorithmic and synthetic language tasks with parameterized difficulty, enabling direct testing of token-level compute allocation. Second, we propose ANIRA, a unified recurrent Transformer framework that supports per-token variable-depth computation while isolating compute allocation decisions from other model factors. Third, we use this framework to conduct a systematic analysis of token-level adaptive computation across alignment with complexity, generalization, and decision timing. Our results show that compute allocation aligned with task complexity can emerge without explicit difficulty supervision, but such alignment does not imply algorithmic generalization: models fail to extrapolate to unseen input sizes despite allocating additional computation. We further find that early compute decisions rely on static structural cues, whereas online halting more closely tracks algorithmic execution state.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faANIRA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b97\u6cd5\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u4f30token\u7ea7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u914d\u53ef\u81ea\u53d1\u5bf9\u9f50\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7b97\u6cd5\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u65e9\u671f\u51b3\u7b56\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u7ebf\u505c\u673a\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1\u7b97\u6cd5\u6267\u884c\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709token\u7ea7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8ba1\u7b97\u7814\u7a76\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u57fa\u51c6\u4e2dtoken\u96be\u5ea6\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e14\u53d7\u67b6\u6784\u56e0\u7d20\u6df7\u6dc6\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u914d\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u5339\u914d\u5e95\u5c42\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u63a7\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f\uff1b2\uff09\u63d0\u51faANIRA\u2014\u2014\u652f\u6301\u6bcftoken\u53d8\u6df1\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5faa\u73afTransformer\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u8026\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u914d\u51b3\u7b56\uff1b3\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u914d\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u53ca\u51b3\u7b56\u65f6\u673a\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u914d\u53ef\u5728\u65e0\u663e\u5f0f\u96be\u5ea6\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u81ea\u53d1\u5bf9\u9f50\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff1b\u4f46\u8be5\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u5e26\u6765\u7b97\u6cd5\u6cdb\u5316\uff08\u5982\u65e0\u6cd5\u5916\u63a8\u81f3\u672a\u89c1\u8f93\u5165\u89c4\u6a21\uff09\uff1b\u65e9\u671f\u51b3\u7b56\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u7ebf\u505c\u673a\u673a\u5236\u66f4\u8d34\u5408\u7b97\u6cd5\u6267\u884c\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "token\u7ea7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u9700\u5728\u53ef\u63a7\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u72ec\u7acb\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u914d\u5bf9\u9f50\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u4f46\u4e0d\u5145\u5206\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u6cdb\u5316\u8fd8\u9700\u5176\u4ed6\u673a\u5236\u652f\u6301\uff1b\u51b3\u7b56\u65f6\u673a\u5f71\u54cd\u5bf9\u9f50\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u6267\u884c\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002"}}

Project page: https://rolling-sink.github.io/", "summary": "Recently, autoregressive (AR) video diffusion models has achieved remarkable performance. However, due to their limited training durations, a train-test gap emerges when testing at longer horizons, leading to rapid visual degradations. Following Self Forcing, which studies the train-test gap within the training duration, this work studies the train-test gap beyond the training duration, i.e., the gap between the limited horizons during training and open-ended horizons during testing. Since open-ended testing can extend beyond any finite training window, and long-video training is computationally expensive, we pursue a training-free solution to bridge this gap. To explore a training-free solution, we conduct a systematic analysis of AR cache maintenance. These insights lead to Rolling Sink. Built on Self Forcing (trained on only 5s clips), Rolling Sink effectively scales the AR video synthesis to ultra-long durations (e.g., 5-30 minutes at 16 FPS) at test time, with consistent subjects, stable colors, coherent structures, and smooth motions. As demonstrated by extensive experiments, Rolling Sink achieves superior long-horizon visual fidelity and temporal consistency compared to SOTA baselines.

This cognitive framework can inspire novel computational architectures for multimodal integration. Indeed, recent implementations of GWT have explored its multimodal representation capabilities, but the related attention mechanisms remain understudied. Here, we propose and evaluate a top-down attention mechanism to select modalities inside a global workspace.

While recent years have seen an increasing development of explainability methods, current evaluation metrics (e.g., fidelity, sparsity) often fail to assess whether an explanation identifies the true underlying causal variables. To address this, we propose the Explanation-Generalization Score (EGS), a metric that quantifies the causal relevance of GNN explanations. EGS is founded on the principle of feature invariance and posits that if an explanation captures true causal drivers, it should lead to stable predictions across distribution shifts. To quantify this, we introduce a framework that trains GNNs using explanatory subgraphs and evaluates their performance in Out-of-Distribution (OOD) settings (here, OOD generalization serves as a rigorous proxy for the explanation's causal validity). Through large-scale validation involving 11,200 model combinations across synthetic and real-world datasets, our results demonstrate that EGS provides a principled benchmark for ranking explainers based on their ability to capture causal substructures, offering a robust alternative to traditional fidelity-based metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GNN\uff09\u540e\u9a8c\u89e3\u91ca\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6307\u6807\u2014\u2014Explanation-Generalization Score\uff08EGS\uff09\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u5229\u7528OOD\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u8861\u91cf\u89e3\u91ca\u662f\u5426\u6355\u83b7\u771f\u5b9e\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709GNN\u89e3\u91ca\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff09\u96be\u4ee5\u5224\u65ad\u89e3\u91ca\u662f\u5426\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u56e0\u679c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEGS\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff1a\u82e5\u89e3\u91ca\u6355\u83b7\u771f\u5b9e\u56e0\u679c\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5219\u5e94\u652f\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5b50\u56fe\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3GNN\u5e76\u5728OOD\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u8be5\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6db5\u76d6\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u603b\u8ba111,200\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cEGS\u88ab\u8bc1\u5b9e\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u56e0\u679c\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6355\u6349\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "EGS\u4e3aGNN\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4ee5\u56e0\u679c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e3a\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ece\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5411\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u6f14\u8fdb\u3002"}}

Existing prediction methods using occupancy grid maps primarily focus on agent-agnostic scene predictions, while agent-specific predictions provide specialized behavior insights with the help of semantic information. However, both paradigms face distinct limitations: agent-agnostic models struggle to capture the behavioral complexities of dynamic actors, whereas agent-specific approaches fail to generalize to poorly perceived or unrecognized agents; combining both enables robust and safer motion forecasting. To address this, we propose a unified framework by leveraging Dynamic Occupancy Grid Maps within a streamlined temporal decoding pipeline to simultaneously predict future occupancy state grids, vehicle grids, and scene flow grids. Relying on a lightweight spatiotemporal backbone, our approach is centered on a tailored, interdependent loss function that captures inter-grid dependencies and enables diverse future predictions. By using occupancy state information to enforce flow-guided transitions, the loss function acts as a regularizer that directs occupancy evolution while accounting for obstacles and occlusions. Consequently, the model not only predicts the specific behaviors of vehicle agents, but also identifies other dynamic entities and anticipates their evolution within the complex scene. Evaluations on real-world nuScenes and Woven Planet datasets demonstrate superior prediction performances for dynamic vehicles and generic dynamic scene elements compared to baseline methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u5360\u7528\u6805\u683c\u56fe\uff08DOGM\uff09\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u5360\u7528\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u8f66\u8f86\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u573a\u666f\u6d41\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u7684\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u573a\u666f\u6f14\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5360\u636e\u6805\u683c\u56fe\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u7c7b\uff1a\u4ee3\u7406\u65e0\u5173\uff08\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u52a8\u6001\u4e3b\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff09\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u7279\u5b9a\uff08\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u81f3\u611f\u77e5\u4e0d\u4f73\u6216\u672a\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\uff09\uff0c\u4e8c\u8005\u5404\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff1b\u9700\u878d\u5408\u4e8c\u8005\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65f6\u7a7a\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5728\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u89e3\u7801\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u4e2d\u8054\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u5360\u7528\u72b6\u6001\u6805\u683c\u3001\u8f66\u8f86\u6805\u683c\u548c\u573a\u666f\u6d41\u6805\u683c\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u80fd\u523b\u753b\u591a\u6805\u683c\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6837\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5360\u7528\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u7ea6\u675f\u6d41\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u969c\u788d\u7269\u4e0e\u906e\u6321\u3002", "result": "\u5728nuScenes\u548cWoven Planet\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u8f66\u8f86\u53ca\u901a\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u5efa\u6a21\u8f66\u8f86\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u901a\u7528\u573a\u666f\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

The system is designed to improve traffic delay and emission while preventing safety-critical errors and providing interpretable control policy outputs based on explicit models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86UCATSC\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u4fe1\u53f7\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4fe1\u5ff5\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u6f14\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u9632\u9965\u997f\u7684\u786c\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u4ea4\u901a\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u73af\u4fdd\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4ea4\u901a\u4fe1\u53f7\u63a7\u5236\u90e8\u7f72\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u9690\u5f0f\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u53ca\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u4e3b\u8981\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff09\u3002", "method": "UCATSC\u5c06\u4ea4\u53c9\u53e3\u4fe1\u53f7\u63a7\u5236\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5e26\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u968f\u673a\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u663e\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fe1\u5ff5\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u542b\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u9632\u9965\u997f\u786c\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u6f14\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4f9d\u8d56\u5956\u52b1\u5851\u5f62\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u4ea4\u901a\u5ef6\u65f6\u4e0e\u6392\u653e\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u9632\u6b62\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5e76\u8f93\u51fa\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "UCATSC\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u786c\u7ea6\u675f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u969c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4ea4\u901a\u4fe1\u53f7\u63a7\u5236\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing approaches largely fall into two paradigms: unified embedding retrieval, which suffers from single-model myopia, and heuristic agentic retrieval, which is limited by suboptimal, trial-and-error orchestration. To this end, we propose OSCAR, an optimization-steered agentic planning framework for composed image retrieval. We are the first to reformulate agentic CIR from a heuristic search process into a principled trajectory optimization problem. Instead of relying on heuristic trial-and-error exploration, OSCAR employs a novel offline-online paradigm. In the offline phase, we model CIR via atomic retrieval selection and composition as a two-stage mixed-integer programming problem, mathematically deriving optimal trajectories that maximize ground-truth coverage for training samples via rigorous boolean set operations. These trajectories are then stored in a golden library to serve as in-context demonstrations for online steering of VLM planner at online inference time. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks and a private industrial benchmark show that OSCAR consistently outperforms SOTA baselines. Notably, it achieves superior performance using only 10% of training data, demonstrating strong generalization of planning logic rather than dataset-specific memorization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faOSCAR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u7ec4\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22\uff08CIR\uff09\u4ece\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u7ebf\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u5728\u7ebf\u5f15\u5bfc\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8aSOTA\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u970010%\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5373\u8fbe\u4f18\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709CIR\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u5927\u5c40\u9650\uff1a\u7edf\u4e00\u5d4c\u5165\u68c0\u7d22\u6613\u53d7\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u89c6\u91ce\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u68c0\u7d22\u4f9d\u8d56\u4f4e\u6548\u8bd5\u9519\u7f16\u6392\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faOSCAR\u4f18\u5316\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u79bb\u7ebf\u9636\u6bb5\u5c06CIR\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5e03\u5c14\u96c6\u5408\u8fd0\u7b97\u63a8\u5bfc\u6700\u4f18\u8f68\u8ff9\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u2018\u9ec4\u91d1\u5e93\u2019\uff1b\u5728\u7ebf\u9636\u6bb5\u4ee5\u8be5\u5e93\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u793a\u4f8b\u5f15\u5bfcVLM\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6\u53ca\u4e00\u4e2a\u79c1\u6709\u5de5\u4e1a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u8d85\u8d8aSOTA\uff1b\u4ec5\u752810%\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u89c4\u5212\u903b\u8f91\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u800c\u975e\u6570\u636e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3002", "conclusion": "OSCAR\u9996\u6b21\u5c06CIR\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e25\u8c28\u6570\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u79bb\u7ebf-\u5728\u7ebf\u534f\u540c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u7d22\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Empirical scaling laws are widely used to predict loss as model size and training data grow, however, almost all existing studies fix the optimizer (typically AdamW). At the same time, a new generation of optimizers (e.g., Muon, Shampoo, SOAP) promises faster and more stable convergence, but their relationship with model and data scaling is not yet well understood. In this work, we study scaling laws across different optimizers. Empirically, we show that 1) separate Chinchilla-style scaling laws for each optimizer are ill-conditioned and have highly correlated parameters. Instead, 2) we propose a more robust law with shared power-law exponents and optimizer-specific rescaling factors, which enable direct comparison between optimizers. Finally, 3) we provide a theoretical analysis of gradient-based methods for the proxy task of a convex quadratic objective, demonstrating that Chinchilla-style scaling laws emerge naturally as a result of loss decomposition into irreducible, approximation, and optimization errors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f29\u653e\u89c4\u5f8b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u56fa\u5b9a\u6307\u6570\u3001\u5f15\u5165\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u91cd\u6807\u5ea6\u56e0\u5b50\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u5f8b\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u51f8\u4e8c\u6b21\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86Chinchilla\u5f0f\u7f29\u653e\u5f8b\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u51fa\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7f29\u653e\u5f8b\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u591a\u56fa\u5b9a\u4f7f\u7528AdamW\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u800c\u65b0\u4e00\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff08\u5982Muon\u3001Shampoo\u3001SOAP\uff09\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u884c\u4e3a\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a2\u7a76\u5176\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u591a\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5177\u6709\u5171\u4eab\u5e42\u5f8b\u6307\u6570\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u91cd\u6807\u5ea6\u56e0\u5b50\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u7f29\u653e\u5f8b\uff1b\u5e76\u4ee5\u51f8\u4e8c\u6b21\u76ee\u6807\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5bf9\u68af\u5ea6\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u89e3\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "1\uff09\u4e3a\u5404\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5355\u72ec\u62df\u5408Chinchilla\u5f0f\u7f29\u653e\u5f8b\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u3001\u75c5\u6001\uff1b2\uff09\u5171\u4eab\u6307\u6570+\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u56e0\u5b50\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u5f8b\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u4e14\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u6bd4\u8f83\uff1b3\uff09\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660eChinchilla\u5f0f\u7f29\u653e\u5f8b\u53ef\u7531\u4e0d\u53ef\u7ea6\u8bef\u5dee\u3001\u903c\u8fd1\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u81ea\u7136\u5bfc\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u7f29\u653e\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e94\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u6307\u6570\u52a0\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u56e0\u5b50\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7f29\u653e\u5f8b\u5728\u7b80\u5316\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Existing vision-based occupancy forecasting methods focus on motion-related categories such as static and dynamic objects, while semantic information remains largely absent. Recent semantic occupancy forecasting approaches address this gap but rely on past occupancy predictions obtained from separate networks. This makes current methods sensitive to error accumulation and prevents learning spatio-temporal features directly from images. In this work, we present ForecastOcc, the first framework for vision-based semantic occupancy forecasting that jointly predicts future occupancy states and semantic categories. Our framework yields semantic occupancy forecasts for multiple horizons directly from past camera images, without relying on externally estimated maps. We evaluate ForecastOcc in two complementary settings: multi-view forecasting on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset and monocular forecasting on SemanticKITTI, where we establish the first benchmark for this task. We introduce the first baselines by adapting two 2D forecasting modules within our framework. Importantly, we propose a novel architecture that incorporates a temporal cross-attention forecasting module, a 2D-to-3D view transformer, a 3D encoder for occupancy prediction, and a semantic occupancy head for voxel-level forecasts across multiple horizons. Extensive experiments on both datasets show that ForecastOcc consistently outperforms baselines, yielding semantically rich, future-aware predictions that capture scene dynamics and semantics critical for autonomous driving.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ForecastOcc\uff0c\u9996\u4e2a\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u8bed\u4e49\u5360\u636e\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Occ3D-nuScenes\u548cSemanticKITTI\u4e0a\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u5360\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u800c\u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53c8\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u5360\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faForecastOcc\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u65f6\u5e8f\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\u30012D\u52303D\u89c6\u56fe\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u30013D\u5360\u636e\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5360\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u5934\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u957f\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bed\u4e49\u5360\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728Occ3D-nuScenes\uff08\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\uff09\u548cSemanticKITTI\uff08\u5355\u76ee\uff09\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u517c\u5177\u8bed\u4e49\u4e30\u5bcc\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u672a\u6765\u5360\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "ForecastOcc\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u771f\u6b63\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\u5360\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u878d\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u672a\u6765\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

A hypothesis is that stronger reasoning capability should improve safety by helping models recognize harmful intent even when it is not stated explicitly. We test this hypothesis in long-context settings where harmful intent is implicit and must be inferred through reasoning, and find that it does not hold. We introduce compositional reasoning attacks, a new threat model in which a harmful query is decomposed into incomplete fragments that scattered throughout a long context. The model is then prompted with a neutral reasoning query that induces retrieval and synthesis, causing the harmful intent to emerge only after composition. Evaluating 14 frontier LLMs on contexts up to 64k tokens, we uncover three findings: (1) models with stronger general reasoning capability are not more robust to compositional reasoning attacks, often assembling the intent yet failing to refuse; (2) safety alignment consistently degrades as context length increases; and (3) inference-time reasoning effort is a key mitigating factor: increasing inference-time compute reduces attack success by over 50 percentage points on GPT-oss-120b model. Together, these results suggest that safety does not automatically scale with reasoning capability, especially under long-context inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u578b\u2014\u2014\u7ec4\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\uff08compositional reasoning attacks\uff09\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u4e0d\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u968f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u589e\u957f\u800c\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u589e\u52a0\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5047\u8bbe\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u9690\u542b\u7684\u6709\u5bb3\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff1b\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u68c0\u9a8c\u8be5\u5047\u8bbe\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001\u9690\u5f0f\u6709\u5bb3\u610f\u56fe\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ec4\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\uff1a\u5c06\u6709\u5bb3\u67e5\u8be2\u62c6\u5206\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u5206\u6563\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2d\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u793a\u8bf1\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u4f7f\u6709\u5bb3\u610f\u56fe\u4ec5\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u540e\u663e\u73b0\uff1b\u5728\u9ad8\u8fbe64k token\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f3014\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbfLLM\u3002", "result": "\uff081\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u672a\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\uff0c\u5e38\u6210\u529f\u7ec4\u5408\u51fa\u6709\u5bb3\u610f\u56fe\u5374\u672a\u62d2\u7edd\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u968f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u589e\u52a0\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\uff08\u5982\u63a8\u7406\u52aa\u529b\uff09\u53ef\u4f7fGPT-oss-120b\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u8d8550\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0d\u4f1a\u968f\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u81ea\u52a8\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\uff1b\u9700\u4e13\u95e8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4f9d\u8d56\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u7136\u5e26\u6765\u5b89\u5168\u589e\u5f3a\u3002"}}

To address this, recent agentic thinking-with-videos paradigms have emerged, adopting a localize-clip-answer pipeline in which the model actively identifies relevant video segments, performs dense sampling within those clips, and then produces answers. However, existing methods remain inefficient, suffer from weak localization, and adhere to rigid workflows. To solve these issues, we propose VideoTemp-o3, a unified agentic thinking-with-videos framework that jointly models video grounding and question answering. VideoTemp-o3 exhibits strong localization capability, supports on-demand clipping, and can refine inaccurate localizations. Specifically, in the supervised fine-tuning stage, we design a unified masking mechanism that encourages exploration while preventing noise. For reinforcement learning, we introduce dedicated rewards to mitigate reward hacking. Besides, from the data perspective, we develop an effective pipeline to construct high-quality long video grounded QA data, along with a corresponding benchmark for systematic evaluation across various video durations.

Previous work has established what problems debate can solve in principle, but has not analysed the practical cost of human oversight: how many queries must the judge make to the debate transcript? We introduce Debate Query Complexity}(DQC), the minimum number of bits a verifier must inspect to correctly decide a debate.\n  Surprisingly, we find that PSPACE/poly (the class of problems which debate can efficiently decide) is precisely the class of functions decidable with O(log n) queries. This characterisation shows that debate is remarkably query-efficient: even for highly complex problems, logarithmic oversight suffices. We also establish that functions depending on all their input bits require Omega(log n) queries, and that any function computable by a circuit of size s satisfies DQC(f) <= log(s) + 3. Interestingly, this last result implies that proving DQC lower bounds of log(n) + 6 for languages in P would yield new circuit lower bounds, connecting debate query complexity to central questions in circuit complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8fa9\u8bba\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff08DQC\uff09\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86PSPACE/poly\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u53ea\u9700O(log n)\u6b21\u67e5\u8be2\u5373\u53ef\u5224\u5b9a\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86AI\u8fa9\u8bba\u673a\u5236\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u7684\u6781\u9ad8\u67e5\u8be2\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86DQC\u4e0e\u7535\u8def\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6df1\u523b\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u6790AI\u5b89\u5168\u4e2d\u8fa9\u8bba\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5373\u88c1\u5224\u9700\u67e5\u770b\u8fa9\u8bba\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u6700\u5c11\u67e5\u8be2\u6b21\u6570\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u8fa9\u8bba\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff08DQC\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8861\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790DQC\u4e0ePSPACE/poly\u3001\u7535\u8def\u5927\u5c0f\u7b49\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660ePSPACE/poly\u6070\u4e3a\u53ef\u7528O(log n)\u6b21\u67e5\u8be2\u5224\u5b9a\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u7c7b\uff1b\u4efb\u610f\u4f9d\u8d56\u5168\u90e8\u8f93\u5165\u4f4d\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u81f3\u5c11\u9700\u03a9(log n)\u6b21\u67e5\u8be2\uff1b\u7535\u8def\u5927\u5c0f\u4e3as\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u6ee1\u8db3DQC(f) \u2264 log(s) + 3\uff1b\u5e76\u6307\u51faDQC\u4e0b\u754c\u7a81\u7834\u53ef\u5bfc\u51fa\u65b0\u7535\u8def\u4e0b\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fa9\u8bba\u673a\u5236\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u6781\u9ad8\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e14DQC\u4e3a\u8fde\u63a5AI\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7406\u8bba\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u7535\u8def\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u6865\u6881\u3002"}}

Recently, zero-shot diffusion based methods have been proposed for such inverse problems, offering a posterior sampling based solution that leverages prior knowledge. Such algorithms incorporate the observations through inference, often leaning on manual tuning and heuristics. In this work we propose a rigorous analysis of such approximate posterior-samplers, relying on a Gaussianity assumption of the prior. Under this regime, we show that both the ideal posterior sampler and diffusion-based reconstruction algorithms can be expressed in closed-form, enabling their thorough analysis and comparisons in the spectral domain. Building on these representations, we also introduce a principled framework for parameter design, replacing heuristic selection strategies used to date. The proposed approach is method-agnostic and yields tailored parameter choices for each algorithm, jointly accounting for the characteristics of the prior, the degraded signal, and the diffusion dynamics. We show that our spectral recommendations differ structurally from standard heuristics and vary with the diffusion step size, resulting in a consistent balance between perceptual quality and signal fidelity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5728\u9ad8\u65af\u5148\u9a8c\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u8c31\u57df\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u539f\u7406\u6027\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53d6\u4ee3\u4e86\u4ee5\u5f80\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u8c03\u53c2\u548c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u5de5\u8c03\u53c2\u548c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u5148\u9a8c\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u7406\u60f3\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u91cd\u5efa\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8c31\u57df\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u6bd4\u8f83\uff1b\u8fdb\u800c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0e\u5177\u4f53\u7b97\u6cd5\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u80fd\u8054\u5408\u8003\u8651\u5148\u9a8c\u3001\u9000\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ca\u6269\u6563\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u7684\u539f\u7406\u6027\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8c31\u57df\u53c2\u6570\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u4e14\u8be5\u63a8\u8350\u968f\u6269\u6563\u6b65\u957f\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u4fe1\u53f7\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6269\u6563\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

For instance, when estimating the poses and shapes of objects in the scene and importing the resulting estimates into a simulator, small errors might translate to implausible configurations including object interpenetration or unstable equilibrium. This makes it difficult to predict the dynamic behavior of the scene using a digital twin, an important step in simulation-based planning and control of contact-rich behaviors. In this paper, we posit that object pose and shape estimation requires reasoning holistically over the scene (instead of reasoning about each object in isolation), accounting for object interactions and physical plausibility. Towards this goal, our first contribution is Picasso, a physics-constrained reconstruction pipeline that builds multi-object scene reconstructions by considering geometry, non-penetration, and physics. Picasso relies on a fast rejection sampling method that reasons over multi-object interactions, leveraging an inferred object contact graph to guide samples. Second, we propose the Picasso dataset, a collection of 10 contact-rich real-world scenes with ground truth annotations, as well as a metric to quantify physical plausibility, which we open-source as part of our benchmark. Finally, we provide an extensive evaluation of Picasso on our newly introduced dataset and on the YCB-V dataset, and show it largely outperforms the state of the art while providing reconstructions that are both physically plausible and more aligned with human intuition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPicasso\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u591a\u7269\u4f53\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u975e\u7a7f\u900f\u6027\u548c\u7269\u7406\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u91cd\u5efa\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f4\u89c9\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u6e90\u4e86\u5305\u542b10\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u906e\u6321\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u867d\u80fd\u62df\u5408\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff08\u5982\u7269\u4f53\u7a7f\u900f\u3001\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u5e73\u8861\uff09\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPicasso\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u91cd\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u7269\u4f53\u8054\u5408\u91cd\u5efa\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u5339\u914d\u3001\u975e\u7a7f\u900f\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a8\u65ad\u63a5\u89e6\u56fe\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u591a\u7269\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u63a8\u7406\uff1b3\uff09\u6784\u5efaPicasso\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ca\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u81ea\u5efaPicasso\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cYCB-V\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPicasso\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91cd\u5efa\u7ed3\u679c\u517c\u5177\u66f4\u9ad8\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\u4e0e\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f4\u89c9\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u7269\u4f53\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u9700\u8d85\u8d8a\u5355\u7269\u4f53\u5b64\u7acb\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u8f6c\u5411\u878d\u5408\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u4ea4\u4e92\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\uff1bPicasso\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0e\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

While numerous deepfake detection methods have been proposed, existing benchmarks predominantly evaluate fine-tuned models, leaving a critical gap in understanding out-of-the-box performance -- the most common deployment scenario for practitioners. We present the first comprehensive zero-shot evaluation of 16 state-of-the-art detection methods, comprising 23 pretrained detector variants (due to multiple released versions of certain detectors), across 12 diverse datasets, comprising 2.6~million image samples spanning 291 unique generators including modern diffusion models. Our systematic analysis reveals striking findings: (1)~no universal winner exists, with detector rankings exhibiting substantial instability (Spearman~$\u03c1$: 0.01 -- 0.87 across dataset pairs); (2)~a 37~percentage-point performance gap separates the best detector (75.0\\% mean accuracy) from the worst (37.5\\%); (3)~training data alignment critically impacts generalization, causing up to 20--60\\% performance variance within architecturally identical detector families; (4)~modern commercial generators (Flux~Dev, Firefly~v4, Midjourney~v7) defeat most detectors, achieving only 18--30\\% average accuracy; and (5)~we identify three systematic failure patterns affecting cross-dataset generalization. Statistical analysis confirms significant performance differences between detectors (Friedman test: $\u03c7^2$=121.01, $p<10^{-16}$, Kendall~$W$=0.524). Our findings challenge the ``one-size-fits-all'' detector paradigm and provide actionable deployment guidelines, demonstrating that practitioners must carefully select detectors based on their specific threat landscape rather than relying on published benchmark performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf916\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672cAI\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9996\u6b21\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6db5\u76d612\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001291\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u5668\u548c260\u4e07\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u5de8\u5927\u5dee\u8ddd\u53ca\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u4e3b\u6d41\u5546\u4e1a\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff08\u5982Flux Dev\u3001Midjourney v7\uff09\u5df2\u4e25\u91cd\u524a\u5f31\u591a\u6570\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3b\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u66f4\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u5f00\u7bb1\u5373\u7528\uff08zero-shot\uff09\u90e8\u7f72\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5bf916\u79cdSOTA\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u517123\u4e2a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u53d8\u4f53\uff09\u572812\u4e2a\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u542b291\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u5668\u3001260\u4e07\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\u4e0a\u5f00\u5c55\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Spearman\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3001Friedman\u68c0\u9a8c\u4e0eKendall W\u7b49\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6cdb\u5316\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a(1) \u65e0\u901a\u7528\u6700\u4f18\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u6392\u540d\u6781\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff08Spearman \u03c1: 0.01\u20130.87\uff09\uff1b(2) \u6700\u4f73\u4e0e\u6700\u5dee\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u76f8\u5dee37\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0875.0% vs 37.5%\uff09\uff1b(3) \u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\u5f71\u54cd\u5de8\u5927\uff08\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u6ce2\u52a8\u8fbe20\u201360%\uff09\uff1b(4) \u4e3b\u6d41\u5546\u4e1a\u751f\u6210\u5668\u4f7f\u591a\u6570\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u964d\u81f318\u201330%\uff1b(5) \u53d1\u73b0\u4e09\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5931\u6548\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bc1\u5b9e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u95f4\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u6781\u663e\u8457\uff08p<10\u207b\u00b9\u2076\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u2018\u901a\u7528\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u2019\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0d\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u5fc5\u987b\u4f9d\u636e\u5177\u4f53\u5a01\u80c1\u573a\u666f\u8c28\u614e\u9009\u578b\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u4f9d\u8d56\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6\u6307\u6807\uff1b\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6307\u5357\u3002"}}

From Normative Principles to Behavioral Drivers", "comment": null, "summary": "As chatbots increasingly blur the boundary between automated systems and human conversation, the foundations of trust in these systems warrant closer examination. While regulatory and policy frameworks tend to define trust in normative terms, the trust users place in chatbots often emerges from behavioral mechanisms. In many cases, this trust is not earned through demonstrated trustworthiness but is instead shaped by interactional design choices that leverage cognitive biases to influence user behavior. Based on this observation, we propose reframing chatbots not as companions or assistants, but as highly skilled salespeople whose objectives are determined by the deploying organization. We argue that the coexistence of competing notions of \"trust\" under a shared term obscures important distinctions between psychological trust formation and normative trustworthiness. Addressing this gap requires further research and stronger support mechanisms to help users appropriately calibrate trust in conversational AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u8fd9\u79cd\u4fe1\u4efb\u5f80\u5f80\u6e90\u4e8e\u4ea4\u4e92\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u5229\u7528\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff1b\u56e0\u6b64\u5efa\u8bae\u5c06\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u4ee5\u7ec4\u7ec7\u76ee\u6807\u4e3a\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u2018\u9ad8\u6280\u80fd\u9500\u552e\u4eba\u5458\u2019\uff0c\u5e76\u547c\u5401\u533a\u5206\u5fc3\u7406\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u5f62\u6210\u4e0e\u89c4\u8303\u610f\u4e49\u4e0a\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u4fe1\u4efb\u6821\u51c6\u652f\u6301\u673a\u5236\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u65e5\u76ca\u6a21\u7cca\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u5176\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u57fa\u7840\u4e9f\u9700\u6df1\u5165\u8003\u5bdf\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u76d1\u7ba1\u4e0e\u653f\u7b56\u6846\u67b6\u591a\u4ece\u89c4\u8303\u89d2\u5ea6\u5b9a\u4e49\u4fe1\u4efb\uff0c\u800c\u7528\u6237\u5b9e\u9645\u4fe1\u4efb\u5374\u5e38\u7531\u884c\u4e3a\u673a\u5236\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u6df7\u6dc6\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u8131\u8282\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u6982\u5ff5\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u91cd\u6784\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u4fe1\u4efb\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e3a\u2018\u9ad8\u6280\u80fd\u9500\u552e\u4eba\u5458\u2019\uff0c\u5e76\u8fa8\u6790\u5fc3\u7406\u4fe1\u4efb\u4e0e\u89c4\u8303\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4fe1\u4efb\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u77db\u76fe\uff1a\u7528\u6237\u4fe1\u4efb\u5e38\u7531\u4ea4\u4e92\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bf1\u53d1\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u5dee\u6240\u5851\u9020\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7cfb\u7edf\u771f\u5b9e\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u2018\u9500\u552e\u5458\u2019\u9690\u55bb\u4ee5\u51f8\u663e\u5176\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u5398\u6e05\u4e0d\u540c\u2018\u4fe1\u4efb\u2019\u6982\u5ff5\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u8bef\u5bfc\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e94\u533a\u5206\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\u4e0a\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u5f62\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0e\u4f26\u7406/\u89c4\u8303\u610f\u4e49\u4e0a\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8981\u6c42\uff1b\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u9700\u805a\u7126\u7528\u6237\u4fe1\u4efb\u6821\u51c6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u66f4\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u7684\u652f\u6301\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u969c\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u77e5\u60c5\u6743\u4e0e\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u3002"}}

Yet, when humans are given a task, regardless of the way it is specified, they can often derive the additional information needed to solve the problem efficiently. The key to this ability is introspection: by reasoning about their internal models of the problem, humans directly synthesize additional task-relevant information. In this paper, we propose that this introspection can be thought of as program analysis. We discuss examples of how this approach can be applied to various kinds of models used in reinforcement learning. We then describe an algorithm that enables efficient goal-oriented planning over the class of models used in relational reinforcement learning, demonstrating a novel link between reinforcement learning and classical planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u5185\u7701\u80fd\u529b\u7c7b\u6bd4\u4e3a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u6b64\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u89c4\u5212\u4e4b\u95f4\u5efa\u7acb\u65b0\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5173\u7cfb\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u80fd\u6839\u636e\u4efb\u52a1\u63cf\u8ff0\u81ea\u4e3b\u63a8\u65ad\u989d\u5916\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u5404\u81ea\u72ec\u7acb\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8fd9\u79cd\u5185\u7701\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5185\u7701\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5173\u7cfb\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5173\u7cfb\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u89c4\u5212\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u65b0\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5185\u7701\u53ef\u88ab\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8be5\u89c6\u89d2\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7edf\u4e00\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In this work, we present a 3D vehicle-conditioned pedestrian pose forecasting framework that explicitly incorporates surrounding vehicle information. To support this, we enhance the Waymo-3DSkelMo dataset with aligned 3D vehicle bounding boxes, enabling realistic modeling of multi-agent pedestrian-vehicle interactions. We introduce a sampling scheme to categorize scenes by pedestrian and vehicle count, facilitating training across varying interaction complexities. Our proposed network adapts the TBIFormer architecture with a dedicated vehicle encoder and pedestrian-vehicle interaction cross-attention module to fuse pedestrian and vehicle features, allowing predictions to be conditioned on both historical pedestrian motion and surrounding vehicles. Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in forecasting accuracy and validate different approaches for modeling pedestrian-vehicle interactions, highlighting the importance of vehicle-aware 3D pose prediction for autonomous driving.

In particular, it arises from a persistent framing of LID as decontextualized text classification, which obscures the central role of prior probability estimation and is reinforced by institutional incentives that favor global, fixed-prior models.

We present the first large-scale cross-paradigm benchmark, evaluating \\textbf{34 models} -- 22 specialized architectures with publicly available pretrained weights and 12 general-purpose VLMs -- across \\textbf{8 standard datasets} (UTKFace, IMDB-WIKI, MORPH, AFAD, CACD, FG-NET, APPA-REAL, AgeDB) totaling 1{,}100 test images per model. Our key finding is striking: \\emph{zero-shot VLMs significantly outperform most specialized models}, achieving an average MAE of 5.65 years compared to 9.88 for non-LLM models. The best VLM (Gemini~3 Flash Preview, MAE~4.32) outperforms the best non-LLM model (MiVOLO, MAE~5.10) by 15\\%. Only MiVOLO, which uniquely combines face and body features via Vision Transformers, competes with VLMs. We further analyze age verification at the 18-year threshold, revealing that non-LLM models exhibit 60--100\\% false adult rates on minors while VLMs achieve 13--25\\%, and demonstrate that coarse age binning (8--9 classes) consistently degrades MAE beyond 13 years. Our stratified analysis across 14 age groups reveals that all models struggle most at extreme ages ($<$5 and 65+). These findings challenge the assumption that task-specific architectures are necessary for age estimation and suggest that the field should redirect toward distilling VLM capabilities into efficient specialized models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8de8\u8303\u5f0f\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8634\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\uff0822\u4e2a\u4e13\u7528\u67b6\u6784+12\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u57288\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u5e74\u9f84\u4f30\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u96f6\u6837\u672cVLM\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5927\u591a\u6570\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u4e13\u7528\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u73b0\u4ee3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u4e0e\u4e13\u7528\u5e74\u9f84\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u65b9\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u53d1\u5c55\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u9996\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8de8\u8303\u5f0f\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f3034\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff0822\u4e2a\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b+12\u4e2a\u901a\u7528VLMs\uff09\u57288\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u9762\u90e8\u5e74\u9f84\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u51711100\u6d4b\u8bd5\u56fe\u50cf/\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u4e0a\u7684MAE\u300118\u5c81\u5e74\u9f84\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u53ca\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u6876\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u5c55\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5206\u5c42\u5206\u6790\uff08\u598214\u4e2a\u5e74\u9f84\u6bb5\u3001\u6781\u503c\u5e74\u9f84\u7b49\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u96f6\u6837\u672cVLM\u5e73\u5747MAE\u4e3a5.65\u5e74\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u975eLLM\u6a21\u578b\u76849.88\u5e74\uff1b\u6700\u4f73VLM\uff08Gemini 3 Flash Preview\uff0cMAE=4.32\uff09\u6bd4\u6700\u4f73\u975eLLM\u6a21\u578b\uff08MiVOLO\uff0cMAE=5.10\uff09\u63d0\u534715%\uff1bVLM\u572818\u5c81\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u8bef\u5224\u7387\u4e3a13\u201325%\uff0c\u8fdc\u4f4e\u4e8e\u975eLLM\u6a21\u578b\u768460\u2013100%\uff1b\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728<5\u5c81\u548c>65\u5c81\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u5dee\uff1b\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u6876\u4f7fMAE\u6076\u5316\u81f313\u5e74\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4efb\u52a1\u4e13\u7528\u67b6\u6784\u5e76\u975e\u5e74\u9f84\u4f30\u8ba1\u6240\u5fc5\u9700\uff1bVLM\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u672a\u6765\u5e94\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u5c06VLM\u80fd\u529b\u84b8\u998f\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Current evaluation of embodied world models has largely focused on perceptual fidelity (e.g., video generation quality), overlooking the functional utility of these models in downstream decision-making tasks. In this work, we introduce WorldArena, a unified benchmark designed to systematically evaluate embodied world models across both perceptual and functional dimensions. WorldArena assesses models through three dimensions: video perception quality, measured with 16 metrics across six sub-dimensions; embodied task functionality, which evaluates world models as data engines, policy evaluators, and action planners integrating with subjective human evaluation. Furthermore, we propose EWMScore, a holistic metric integrating multi-dimensional performance into a single interpretable index. Through extensive experiments on 14 representative models, we reveal a significant perception-functionality gap, showing that high visual quality does not necessarily translate into strong embodied task capability.

NCP predicts discrete concepts that span multiple tokens, thereby forming a more challenging pretraining objective. Our model, ConceptLM, quantizes hidden states using Vector Quantization and constructs a concept vocabulary. It leverages both NCP and NTP to drive parameter updates and generates a concept to guide the generation of the following tokens. We train ConceptLM from scratch at scales ranging from 70M to 1.5B parameters with up to 300B training data, including Pythia and GPT-2 backbones. Results on 13 benchmarks show that NCP yields consistent performance gains over traditional token-level models. Furthermore, continual pretraining experiments on an 8B-parameter Llama model indicate that NCP can further improve an NTP-trained model. Our analysis suggests that NCP leads to more powerful language models by introducing a harder pretraining task, providing a promising path toward better language modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aNext Concept Prediction\uff08NCP\uff09\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u8de8\u8d8a\u591a\u4e2atoken\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u6982\u5ff5\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u4f20\u7edfNext Token Prediction\uff08NTP\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728ConceptLM\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eNCP\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8etoken\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u5df2\u8bad\u7ec3\u597d\u7684\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfNext Token Prediction\uff08NTP\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5145\u5206\u6fc0\u53d1\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6f5c\u529b\uff1b\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u5e76\u5efa\u6a21\u66f4\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u8bed\u4e49\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee5\u79bb\u6563\u2018\u6982\u5ff5\u2019\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u7684NCP\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNext Concept Prediction\uff08NCP\uff09\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff1b\u6784\u5efaConceptLM\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u5411\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\uff08VQ\uff09\u5bf9\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u4ee5\u5f62\u6210\u6982\u5ff5\u8bcd\u8868\uff0c\u5e76\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316NCP\u4e0eNTP\u76ee\u6807\uff1b\u652f\u6301\u4ece\u5934\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0870M\u20131.5B\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u53ca\u5bf9\u5df2\u6709\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u59828B Llama\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u572813\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cConceptLM\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u4e8e\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u7eafNTP\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u5bf98B Llama\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884cNCP\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u6027\u80fd\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u6d88\u878d\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u5b9eNCP\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "NCP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u96be\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u8bed\u4e49\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5f3a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Most diffusion-based reconstructions are formulated around Gaussian-noise corruption and rely on additional consistency steps to incorporate SMS physics, which can be mismatched to the operator-governed degradations in SMS acquisition. We propose an operator-guided framework that models the degradation trajectory using known acquisition operators and inverts this process via deterministic updates. Within this framework, we introduce an operator-conditional dual-stream interaction network (OCDI-Net) that explicitly disentangles target-slice content from inter-slice interference and predicts structured degradations for operator-aligned inversion, and we instantiate reconstruction as a two-stage chained inference procedure that performs SMS slice separation followed by in-plane completion.

Surprisingly Strong and Sparse Reinforcement Learning with SGD in LLMs", "comment": null, "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly RL from verifiable reward (RLVR), has become a crucial phase of training large language models (LLMs) and a key focus of current scaling efforts. However, optimization practices in RL largely follow those of next-token prediction stages (e.g., pretraining and supervised fine-tuning), despite fundamental differences between RL and these stages highlighted by recent work. One such practice is the use of the AdamW optimizer, which is widely adopted for training large-scale transformers despite its high memory overhead. Our analysis shows that both momentum and adaptive learning rates in AdamW are less influential in RL than in SFT, leading us to hypothesize that RL benefits less from Adam-style per-parameter adaptive learning rates and momentum. Confirming this hypothesis, our experiments demonstrate that the substantially more memory-efficient SGD, which is known to perform poorly in supervised learning of large-scale transformers, matches or even outperforms AdamW in RL for LLMs. Remarkably, full fine-tuning with SGD updates fewer than 0.02% of model parameters without any sparsity-promoting regularization, more than 1000 times fewer than AdamW. Our analysis offers potential reasons for this update sparsity. These findings provide new insights into the optimization dynamics of RL in LLMs and show that RL can be substantially more parameter-efficient than previously recognized.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684SGD\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u53ef\u5339\u654c\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684AdamW\uff0c\u4e14SGD\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u6bd4\u4f8b\u6781\u4f4e\uff08<0.02%\uff09\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86RL\u9636\u6bb5\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RL\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662fRLVR\uff09\u6cbf\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u8df5\uff08\u5982AdamW\uff09\uff0c\u4f46RL\u4e0e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9636\u6bb5\u5b58\u5728\u672c\u8d28\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b\u800cAdamW\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u673a\u5236\uff08\u52a8\u91cf\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\uff09\u5728RL\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4AdamW\u4e0eSGD\u5728LLM\u7684RL\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u8003\u5bdf\u52a8\u91cf\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "SGD\u5728RL\u9636\u6bb5\u6027\u80fd\u5339\u914d\u6216\u4f18\u4e8eAdamW\uff1bSGD\u4ec5\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0d\u52300.02%\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u8fdc\u4f4e\u4e8eAdamW\uff08\u8d851000\u500d\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u7a00\u758f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff1b\u8be5\u73b0\u8c61\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "RL\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u540c\uff0cSGD\u66f4\u9002\u914dRL\uff0c\u4e14RL\u672c\u8eab\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u666e\u904d\u8ba4\u77e5\u3002"}}

Such misaligned actions may arise from external attacks (e.g., indirect prompt injection) or from internal limitations (e.g., erroneous reasoning). They not only expose CUAs to safety risks, but also degrade task efficiency and reliability. This work makes the first effort to define and study misaligned action detection in CUAs, with comprehensive coverage of both externally induced and internally arising misaligned actions. We further identify three common categories in real-world CUA deployment and construct MisActBench, a benchmark of realistic trajectories with human-annotated, action-level alignment labels. Moreover, we propose DeAction, a practical and universal guardrail that detects misaligned actions before execution and iteratively corrects them through structured feedback. DeAction outperforms all existing baselines across offline and online evaluations with moderate latency overhead: (1) On MisActBench, it outperforms baselines by over 15% absolute in F1 score; (2) In online evaluation, it reduces attack success rate by over 90% under adversarial settings while preserving or even improving task success rate in benign environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5b9a\u4e49\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee3\u7406\uff08CUAs\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u4f4d\u52a8\u4f5c\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u5916\u90e8\u8bf1\u5bfc\u548c\u5185\u90e8\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u9519\u4f4d\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u5168\u9762\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u8f68\u8ff9\u57fa\u51c6MisActBench\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5b9e\u7528\u901a\u7528\u7684\u9632\u62a4\u673a\u5236DeAction\uff0c\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u4e0e\u5728\u7ebf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "CUAs\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u504f\u79bb\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u9519\u4f4d\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u52a8\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u6e90\u4e8e\u5916\u90e8\u653b\u51fb\uff08\u5982\u95f4\u63a5\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\uff09\u6216\u5185\u90e8\u7f3a\u9677\uff08\u5982\u9519\u8bef\u63a8\u7406\uff09\uff0c\u5e26\u6765\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u7ea0\u6b63\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDeAction\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u6267\u884c\u524d\u68c0\u6d4b\u9519\u4f4d\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u53cd\u9988\u8fed\u4ee3\u4fee\u6b63\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5b88\u536b\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u6784\u5efa\u9996\u4e2a\u6db5\u76d6\u771f\u5b9e\u90e8\u7f72\u573a\u666f\u3001\u542b\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u52a8\u4f5c\u7ea7\u5bf9\u9f50\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u57fa\u51c6MisActBench\u3002", "result": "DeAction\u5728MisActBench\u4e0aF1\u5206\u6570\u7edd\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u8d8515%\uff1b\u5728\u7ebf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bf9\u6297\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u8d8590%\uff0c\u826f\u6027\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u9002\u5ea6\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u786e\u7acb\u4e86CUA\u9519\u4f4d\u52a8\u4f5c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86DeAction\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u901a\u7528\u3001\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5b88\u536b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347CUA\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u843d\u5730\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, each paradigm suffers from inherent limitations when operating in isolation: OVAD is restricted to coarse category-level semantics, while RSVG is structurally limited to single-target localization. These limitations prevent existing methods from simultaneously supporting rich semantic understanding and multi-target detection. To address this, we propose OTA-Det, the first unified framework that bridges both paradigms into a cohesive architecture. Specifically, we introduce a task reformulation strategy that unifies task objectives and supervision mechanisms, enabling joint training across datasets from both paradigms with dense supervision signals. Furthermore, we propose a dense semantic alignment strategy that establishes explicit correspondence at multiple granularities, from holistic expressions to individual attributes, enabling fine-grained semantic understanding. To ensure real-time efficiency, OTA-Det builds upon the RT-DETR architecture, extending it from closed-set detection to open-text detection by introducing several high efficient modules, achieving state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks spanning both OVAD and RSVG tasks while maintaining real-time inference at 34 FPS.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86OTA-Det\uff0c\u9996\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u7a7a\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08OVAD\uff09\u4e0e\u9065\u611f\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff08RSVG\uff09\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u91cd\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u5bc6\u96c6\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8eRT-DETR\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "OVAD\u4ec5\u652f\u6301\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u7c7b\u522b\u8bed\u4e49\uff0cRSVG\u4ec5\u9650\u5355\u76ee\u6807\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u4e8c\u8005\u5b64\u7acb\u4f7f\u7528\u65e0\u6cd5\u517c\u987e\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faOTA-Det\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u91cd\u5b9a\u4e49\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u76d1\u7763\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u8303\u5f0f\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b2\uff09\u5bc6\u96c6\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4ece\u6574\u4f53\u63cf\u8ff0\u5230\u4e2a\u4f53\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u663e\u5f0f\u5bf9\u5e94\uff1b3\uff09\u57fa\u4e8eRT-DETR\u6269\u5c55\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f00\u653e\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2aOVAD\u4e0eRSVG\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u630134 FPS\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "OTA-Det\u6210\u529f\u878d\u5408OVAD\u4e0eRSVG\u4e24\u5927\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u5404\u81ea\u56fa\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4e3a\u822a\u7a7a\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u517c\u5177\u8bed\u4e49\u4e30\u5bcc\u6027\u3001\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8fd0\u884c\u6548\u7387\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Accepted AAMAS'26 submission", "summary": "Solving partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) requires computing policies under imperfect state information. Despite recent advances, the scalability of existing POMDP solvers remains limited. Moreover, many settings require a policy that is robust across multiple POMDPs, further aggravating the scalability issue. We propose the Lexpop framework for POMDP solving. Lexpop (1) employs deep reinforcement learning to train a neural policy, represented by a recurrent neural network, and (2) constructs a finite-state controller mimicking the neural policy through efficient extraction methods. Crucially, unlike neural policies, such controllers can be formally evaluated, providing performance guarantees. We extend Lexpop to compute robust policies for hidden-model POMDPs (HM-POMDPs), which describe finite sets of POMDPs. We associate every extracted controller with its worst-case POMDP. Using a set of such POMDPs, we iteratively train a robust neural policy and consequently extract a robust controller.

Adaptive Data Analysis (ADA) mechanisms address this challenge; however, there is a fundamental tension between computational efficiency and sample complexity. For $T$ rounds of adaptive analysis, computationally efficient algorithms typically incur suboptimal $O(\\sqrt{T})$ sample complexity, whereas statistically optimal $O(\\log T)$ algorithms are computationally intractable under standard cryptographic assumptions. In this work, we shed light on this trade-off by identifying a natural class of data distributions under which both computational efficiency and optimal sample complexity are achievable. We propose a computationally efficient ADA mechanism that attains optimal $O(\\log T)$ sample complexity when the data distribution is dense with respect to a known prior. This setting includes, in particular, feature--label data distributions arising in distribution-specific learning. As a consequence, our mechanism also yields a sample-efficient (i.e., $O(\\log T)$ samples) statistical query oracle in the distribution-specific setting. Moreover, although our algorithm is not based on differential privacy, it satisfies a relaxed privacy notion known as Predicate Singling Out (PSO) security (Cohen and Nissim, 2020).

In this paper, we view latent chain-of-thought as a manipulable causal process in representation space by modeling latent steps as variables in a structural causal model (SCM) and analyzing their effects through step-wise $\\mathrm{do}$-interventions. We study two representative paradigms (i.e., Coconut and CODI) on both mathematical and general reasoning tasks to investigate three key questions: (1) which steps are causally necessary for correctness and when answers become decidable early; (2) how does influence propagate across steps, and how does this structure compare to explicit CoT; and (3) do intermediate trajectories retain competing answer modes, and how does output-level commitment differ from representational commitment across steps. We find that latent-step budgets behave less like homogeneous extra depth and more like staged functionality with non-local routing, and we identify a persistent gap between early output bias and late representational commitment.

Current deep learning approaches to structure-based drug design rely on expensive all-atom diffusion to generate 3D coordinates, creating inference bottlenecks that render large-scale compound screening computationally intractable. We challenge this paradigm with a critical hypothesis: full all-atom resolution is unnecessary for accurate small molecule pose and binding affinity prediction. TerraBind tests this hypothesis through a coarse pocket-level representation (protein C$_\u03b2$ atoms and ligand heavy atoms only) within a multimodal architecture combining COATI-3 molecular encodings and ESM-2 protein embeddings that learns rich structural representations, which are used in a diffusion-free optimization module for pose generation and a binding affinity likelihood prediction module. On structure prediction benchmarks (FoldBench, PoseBusters, Runs N' Poses), TerraBind matches diffusion-based baselines in ligand pose accuracy. Crucially, TerraBind outperforms Boltz-2 by $\\sim$20\\% in Pearson correlation for binding affinity prediction on both a public benchmark (CASP16) and a diverse proprietary dataset (18 biochemical/cell assays). We show that the affinity prediction module also provides well-calibrated affinity uncertainty estimates, addressing a critical gap in reliable compound prioritization for drug discovery. Furthermore, this module enables a continual learning framework and a hedged batch selection strategy that, in simulated drug discovery cycles, achieves 6$\\times$ greater affinity improvement of selected molecules over greedy-based approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "TerraBind \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u86cb\u767d\u8d28-\u914d\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u7ed3\u5408\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5316\u539f\u5b50\u8868\u793a\uff08\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u86cb\u767dC\u03b2\u548c\u914d\u4f53\u91cd\u539f\u5b50\uff09\u53ca\u53bb\u6269\u6563\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6784\u8c61\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u534726\u500d\u3001\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ea620%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u836f\u7269\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u5168\u539f\u5b50\u6269\u6563\u751f\u62103D\u5750\u6807\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u5408\u7269\u7b5b\u9009\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\uff1b\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u5047\u8bbe\uff1a\u5168\u539f\u5b50\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5bf9\u5c0f\u5206\u5b50\u5bf9\u63a5\u4e0e\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u9884\u6d4b\u5e76\u975e\u5fc5\u9700\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7c97\u7c92\u5316\u53e3\u888b\u7ea7\u8868\u5f81\uff08\u86cb\u767dC\u03b2 + \u914d\u4f53\u91cd\u539f\u5b50\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408COATI-3\u5206\u5b50\u7f16\u7801\u4e0eESM-2\u86cb\u767d\u5d4c\u5165\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u67b6\u6784\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u65e0\u6269\u6563\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u5757\u751f\u6210\u914d\u4f53\u6784\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ed3\u5408\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u4f3c\u7136\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u5728FoldBench\u7b49\u7ed3\u6784\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5339\u654c\u6269\u6563\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u5728CASP16\u548c\u5185\u90e818\u79cd\u751f\u5316/\u7ec6\u80de\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u9884\u6d4bPearson\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6bd4Boltz-2\u63d0\u5347\u7ea620%\uff1b\u63d0\u4f9b\u6821\u51c6\u826f\u597d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u5bf9\u51b2\u5f0f\u6279\u91cf\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u53d1\u73b0\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b06\u500d\u4e8e\u8d2a\u5a6a\u6cd5\u7684\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "TerraBind\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7c97\u7c92\u5316\u8868\u5f81\u4e0e\u65e0\u6269\u6563\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Despite rapid advances, current systems lack spatial persistence: they fail to maintain stable scene structures over long trajectories, frequently hallucinating details when cameras revisit previously observed locations. We identify that this geometric drift stems from reliance on screen-space positional embeddings, which conflict with the projective geometry required for 3D consistency. We introduce \\textbf{ViewRope}, a geometry-aware encoding that injects camera-ray directions directly into video transformer self-attention layers. By parameterizing attention with relative ray geometry rather than pixel locality, ViewRope provides a model-native inductive bias for retrieving 3D-consistent content across temporal gaps. We further propose \\textbf{Geometry-Aware Frame-Sparse Attention}, which exploits these geometric cues to selectively attend to relevant historical frames, improving efficiency without sacrificing memory consistency. We also present \\textbf{ViewBench}, a diagnostic suite measuring loop-closure fidelity and geometric drift.

We establish total-variation guarantees to the ideal aligned model, and demonstrate in both continuous and discrete diffusion settings that LCB sampling closely matches ideal rejection sampling while using substantially fewer queries to the pretrained model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLearnable Chernoff Baselines (LCBs)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5730\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5956\u52b1\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u9ed1\u76d2\u91c7\u6837\u8bbf\u95ee\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5956\u52b1\u5f15\u5bfc\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u67b6\u6784\u5b9a\u5236\u6216\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u901a\u7528\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7406\u8bba\u53ef\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLearnable Chernoff Baselines\uff08LCBs\uff09\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684Chernoff\u754c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6307\u6570\u503e\u659c\u6838\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5728\u4ec5\u8bbf\u95ee\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u6837\u63a5\u53e3\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u8c03\u63a7\u63a5\u53d7\u6982\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u4e0e\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0cLCB\u91c7\u6837\u5728\u603b\u53d8\u5dee\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0b\u903c\u8fd1\u7406\u60f3\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u6b21\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "LCBs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u5177\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u969c\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5956\u52b1\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5404\u7c7b\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

In promoter DNA design and protein backbone generation settings, RMF achieves comparable sample quality to prior methods while requiring up to 10$\\times$ fewer function evaluations.

We introduce SSI-Bench, a VQA benchmark for spatial reasoning on constrained manifolds, built from complex real-world 3D structures whose feasible configurations are tightly governed by geometric, topological, and physical constraints. SSI-Bench contains 1,000 ranking questions spanning geometric and topological reasoning and requiring a diverse repertoire of compositional spatial operations, such as mental rotation, cross-sectional inference, occlusion reasoning, and force-path reasoning. It is created via a fully human-centered pipeline: ten researchers spent over 400 hours curating images, annotating structural components, and designing questions to minimize pixel-level cues. Evaluating 31 widely used VLMs reveals a large gap to humans: the best open-source model achieves 22.2% accuracy and the strongest closed-source model reaches 33.6%, while humans score 91.6%. Encouraging models to think yields only marginal gains, and error analysis points to failures in structural grounding and constraint-consistent 3D reasoning.

To bridge this gap, we introduce Negative-Aware Diffusion model for TKG Extrapolation (NADEx). Specifically, NADEx encodes subject-centric histories of entities, relations and temporal intervals into sequential embeddings. NADEx perturbs the query object in the forward process and reconstructs it in reverse with a Transformer denoiser conditioned on the temporal-relational context.

We introduce $D^3PO$, a PPO-based framework that reorganizes multi-objective policy optimization to address these issues directly. $D^3PO$ preserves per-objective learning signals through a decomposed optimization pipeline and integrates preferences only after stabilization, enabling reliable credit assignment. In addition, a scaled diversity regularizer enforces sensitivity of policy behavior to preference changes, preventing collapse. Across standard MORL benchmarks, including high-dimensional and many-objective control tasks, $D^3PO$ consistently discovers broader and higher-quality Pareto fronts than prior single- and multi-policy methods, matching or exceeding state-of-the-art hypervolume and expected utility while using a single deployable policy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faD\u00b3PO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u4f18\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u5f15\u5165\u7f29\u653e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u68af\u5ea6\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u8868\u5f81\u574d\u584c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86Pareto\u524d\u6cbf\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u504f\u597d\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u5b8c\u6574\u7684Pareto\u524d\u6cbf\uff0c\u6839\u6e90\u5728\u4e8e\u8fc7\u65e9\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7834\u574f\u6027\u68af\u5ea6\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u504f\u597d\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u574d\u584c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8ePPO\u7684D\u00b3PO\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u91c7\u7528\u89e3\u8026\u4f18\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u5404\u76ee\u6807\u72ec\u7acb\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u7a33\u5b9a\u540e\u624d\u878d\u5165\u504f\u597d\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u7f29\u653e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u504f\u597d\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u574d\u584c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6MORL\u57fa\u51c6\uff08\u542b\u9ad8\u7ef4\u3001\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\uff09\u4e0a\uff0cD\u00b3PO\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u73b0\u66f4\u5e7f\u3001\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684Pareto\u524d\u6cbf\uff0c\u5728\u8d85\u4f53\u79ef\u548c\u671f\u671b\u6548\u7528\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u9700\u5355\u4e2a\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "D\u00b3PO\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86MORL\u4e2d\u5173\u952e\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u4e3a\u5355\u7b56\u7565\u504f\u597d\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Progress is further limited by the scarcity of large, well-annotated datasets for case-based medical image retrieval. We introduce WristMIR, a region-aware pediatric wrist radiograph retrieval framework that leverages dense radiology reports and bone-specific localization to learn fine-grained, clinically meaningful image representations without any manual image-level annotations. Using MedGemma-based structured report mining to generate both global and region-level captions, together with pre-processed wrist images and bone-specific crops of the distal radius, distal ulna, and ulnar styloid, WristMIR jointly trains global and local contrastive encoders and performs a two-stage retrieval process: (1) coarse global matching to identify candidate exams, followed by (2) region-conditioned reranking aligned to a predefined anatomical bone region. WristMIR improves retrieval performance over strong vision-language baselines, raising image-to-text Recall@5 from 0.82% to 9.35%. Its embeddings also yield stronger fracture classification (AUROC 0.949, AUPRC 0.953). In region-aware evaluation, the two-stage design markedly improves retrieval-based fracture diagnosis, increasing mean $F_1$ from 0.568 to 0.753, and radiologists rate its retrieved cases as more clinically relevant, with mean scores rising from 3.36 to 4.35. These findings highlight the potential of anatomically guided retrieval to enhance diagnostic reasoning and support clinical decision-making in pediatric musculoskeletal imaging.

This requires operationalization of values, which can be prone to misspecification. The social nature of values demands their representation to adhere to multiple users while value systems are diverse, yet exhibit patterns among groups. In sequential decision making, efforts have been made towards personalization for different goals or values from demonstrations of diverse agents. However, these approaches demand manually designed features or lack value-based interpretability and/or adaptability to diverse user preferences.\n  We propose algorithms for learning models of value alignment and value systems for a society of agents in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), based on clustering and preference-based multi-objective reinforcement learning (PbMORL). We jointly learn socially-derived value alignment models (groundings) and a set of value systems that concisely represent different groups of users (clusters) in a society. Each cluster consists of a value system representing the value-based preferences of its members and an approximately Pareto-optimal policy that reflects behaviours aligned with this value system.

MaD-Mix systematically handles domains with missing modalities, allowing for the integration of language-only domains. Empirical evaluations across 0.5B and 7B models demonstrate that MaD-Mix accelerates VLM training across diverse benchmarks. MaD-Mix matches human-tuned data mixtures using 22% fewer training steps in image-text instruction tuning.

Chen", "Duochao Shi", "Guosheng Lin", "Hao Chen", "Chunhua Shen"], "title": "Scalable Adaptation of 3D Geometric Foundation Models via Weak Supervision from Internet Video", "comment": null, "summary": "Geometric foundation models show promise in 3D reconstruction, yet their progress is severely constrained by the scarcity of diverse, large-scale 3D annotations. While Internet videos offer virtually unlimited raw data, utilizing them as a scaling source for geometric learning is challenging due to the absence of ground-truth geometry and the presence of observational noise. To address this, we propose SAGE, a framework for Scalable Adaptation of GEometric foundation models from raw video streams. SAGE leverages a hierarchical mining pipeline to transform videos into training trajectories and hybrid supervision: (1) Informative training trajectory selection; (2) Sparse Geometric Anchoring via SfM point clouds for global structural guidance; and (3) Dense Differentiable Consistency via 3D Gaussian rendering for multi-view constraints.

With the rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs), state-of-the-art performance in tabular anomaly detection has been achieved by converting tabular data into text and fine-tuning LLMs. However, these methods randomly order columns during conversion, without considering the causal relationships between them, which is crucial for accurately detecting anomalies. In this paper, we present CausalTaD, a method that injects causal knowledge into LLMs for tabular anomaly detection. We first identify the causal relationships between columns and reorder them to align with these causal relationships. This reordering can be modeled as a linear ordering problem. Since each column contributes differently to the causal relationships, we further propose a reweighting strategy to assign different weights to different columns to enhance this effect. Experiments across more than 30 datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.

By contrast, in vision-language models (VLMs), substantial differences between visual and text tokens in their activation distributions and sensitivities to quantization error pose significant challenges for effective calibration during PTQ. In this work, we rethink what PTQ calibration should align with in VLMs and propose the Token-level Importance-aware Layer-wise Quantization framework (TLQ). Guided by gradient information, we design a token-level importance integration mechanism for quantization error, and use it to construct a token-level calibration set, enabling a more fine-grained calibration strategy. Furthermore, TLQ introduces a multi-GPU, quantization-exposed layer-wise calibration scheme. This scheme keeps the layer-wise calibration procedure consistent with the true quantized inference path and distributes the complex layer-wise calibration workload across multiple RTX3090 GPUs, thereby reducing reliance on the large memory of A100 GPUs.

The gold standard - the Delphi method - produces calibrated, auditable judgments but requires months of coordination and specialist time, placing rigorous risk assessment out of reach for most applications. We investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can serve as scalable proxies for structured expert elicitation. We propose Scalable Delphi, adapting the classical protocol for LLMs with diverse expert personas, iterative refinement, and rationale sharing. Because target quantities are typically unobservable, we develop an evaluation framework based on necessary conditions: calibration against verifiable proxies, sensitivity to evidence, and alignment with human expert judgment. We evaluate in the domain of AI-augmented cybersecurity risk, using three capability benchmarks and independent human elicitation studies. LLM panels achieve strong correlations with benchmark ground truth (Pearson r=0.87-0.95), improve systematically as evidence is added, and align with human expert panels - in one comparison, closer to a human panel than the two human panels are to each other. This demonstrates that LLM-based elicitation can extend structured expert judgment to settings where traditional methods are infeasible, reducing elicitation time from months to minutes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faScalable Delphi\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e13\u5bb6\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u5b9a\u91cf\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5fb7\u5c14\u83f2\u6cd5\u867d\u53ef\u9760\u4f46\u8017\u65f6\u8017\u529b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u591a\u6570\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\uff1b\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faScalable Delphi\uff1a\u4e3aLLM\u8bbe\u5b9a\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4e13\u5bb6\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u7406\u7531\u5171\u4eab\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff08\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u3001\u8bc1\u636e\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3001\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5728AI\u589e\u5f3a\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cLLM\u5c0f\u7ec4\u4e0e\u57fa\u51c6\u771f\u503c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u9ad8\uff08r=0.87\u20130.95\uff09\uff0c\u968f\u8bc1\u636e\u589e\u52a0\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u5224\u65ad\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u4f18\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5c0f\u7ec4\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e13\u5bb6\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u6709\u6548\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5c06\u4e13\u5bb6\u7814\u5224\u5468\u671f\u4ece\u6570\u6708\u7f29\u77ed\u81f3\u6570\u5206\u949f\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u4e25\u8c28\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8fb9\u754c\u3002"}}

However, applying RL to dLLMs faces unique challenges in efficiency and stability. To address these challenges, we propose Spatio-Temporal Pruning (STP), a framework designed to simultaneously improve the efficiency and stability of RL for dLLMs. STP compresses the redundancy in the generative process through: (1) \\textit{spatial pruning}, which constrains the exploration space using static priors; and (2) \\textit{temporal pruning}, which bypasses redundant late-stage refinement steps. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that STP strictly reduces the variance of the log-likelihood estimation, thereby ensuring more stable policy updates.

We study the approximation of matrix functions, which map scalar functions to matrices, using neural networks including transformers. We focus on functions mapping square matrices to square matrices of the same dimension. These types of matrix functions appear throughout scientific computing, e.g., the matrix exponential in continuous-time Markov chains and the matrix sign function in stability analysis of dynamical systems. In this paper, we make two contributions. First, we prove bounds on the width and depth of ReLU networks needed to approximate the matrix exponential to an arbitrary precision. Second, we show experimentally that a transformer encoder-decoder with suitable numerical encodings can approximate certain matrix functions at a relative error of 5% with high probability.

We introduce CausalT5K, a diagnostic benchmark of over 5,000 cases across 10 domains that tests three critical capabilities: (1) detecting rung collapse, where models answer interventional queries with associational evidence; (2) resisting sycophantic drift under adversarial pressure; and (3) generating Wise Refusals that specify missing information when evidence is underdetermined. Unlike synthetic benchmarks, CausalT5K embeds causal traps in realistic narratives and decomposes performance into Utility (sensitivity) and Safety (specificity), revealing failure modes invisible to aggregate accuracy. Developed through a rigorous human-machine collaborative pipeline involving 40 domain experts, iterative cross-validation cycles, and composite verification via rule-based, LLM, and human scoring, CausalT5K implements Pearl's Ladder of Causation as research infrastructure. Preliminary experiments reveal a Four-Quadrant Control Landscape where static audit policies universally fail, a finding that demonstrates CausalT5K's value for advancing trustworthy reasoning systems.

Controlling how LLMs internally represent concepts typically requires sophisticated methods to first identify, then intervene on the model's existing feature geometry. We bypass all of this.\n  We finetune an LLM with a simple auxiliary loss, training 16 of its 3072 residual stream dimensions to be inert interpretability flags that simply indicate what concepts are required for generation. The model reorganizes around them anyway, learning to rely on these flags during actual generation tasks. As a result, these inert flags become genuine internal features: interpretable control switches that allow us to steer generation at inference time. Why does this work? When a feature is reliably supplied at a fixed location, gradient descent gradually eliminates redundant encodings elsewhere, and the model erodes its own alternative representations.

To improve the generalization of the model, we regard different surveillance scenes as different category scenes, and introduce few-shot learning to make the model adapt to the unseen surveillance scene that belongs to the given exemplar category scene. To this end, we propose to leverage local and global density characteristics to guide the model of crowd counting for unseen surveillance scenes. Specifically, to enable the model to adapt to the varying density variations in the target scene, we propose the multiple local density learner to learn multi prototypes which represent different density distributions in the support scene. Subsequently, these multiple local density similarity matrixes are encoded. And they are utilized to guide the model in a local way. To further adapt to the global density in the target scene, the global density features are extracted from the support image, then it is used to guide the model in a global way.

We introduce CoRefine, a confidence-guided self-refinement method that achieves competitive accuracy using a fraction of the tokens via a lightweight 211k-parameter Conv1D controller atop a frozen LLM. The controller consumes full-trace confidence to decide whether to halt, re-examine, or try a different approach, enabling targeted self-correction with an average of 2.7 refinement steps per problem and roughly 190-fold token reduction relative to 512-sample baselines. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks and three open-source models, the controller achieves 92.6 percent precision when it confidently halts, indicating that confidence dynamics reliably signal correctness without ground-truth verification. We extend this to CoRefine-Tree, a hybrid sequential-parallel variant that adaptively balances exploration and exploitation, with easy serving integration and verifier compatibility.

In LLM reasoning, existing works also explore various solutions for learning effective process reward models (PRM) with or without the help of an expert policy. However, existing methods either rely on strong assumptions about the expert policies (e.g., requiring their reward functions) or suffer intrinsic limitations (e.g., entropy collapse), resulting in weak PRMs or limited generalizability. In this paper, we introduce rePIRL, an inverse RL-inspired framework that learns effective PRMs with minimal assumptions about expert policies. Specifically, we design a dual learning process that updates the policy and the PRM interchangeably. Our learning algorithm has customized techniques to address the challenges of scaling traditional inverse RL to LLMs. We theoretically show that our proposed learning framework can unify both online and offline PRM learning methods, justifying that rePIRL can learn PRMs with minimal assumptions. Empirical evaluations on standardized math and coding reasoning datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of rePIRL over existing methods. We further show the application of our trained PRM in test-time training, test-time scaling, and providing an early signal for training hard problems.

We introduce D-ORCA, a \\textbf{d}ialogue-centric \\textbf{o}mni-modal large language model optimized for \\textbf{r}obust audio-visual \\textbf{ca}ptioning. We further curate DVD, a large-scale, high-quality bilingual dataset comprising nearly 40,000 multi-party dialogue videos for training and 2000 videos for evaluation in English and Mandarin, addressing a critical gap in the open-source ecosystem. To ensure fine-grained captioning accuracy, we adopt group relative policy optimization with three novel reward functions that assess speaker attribution accuracy, global speech content accuracy, and sentence-level temporal boundary alignment. These rewards are derived from evaluation metrics widely used in speech processing and, to our knowledge, are applied for the first time as reinforcement learning objectives for audio-visual captioning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that D-ORCA substantially outperforms existing open-source models in speaker identification, speech recognition, and temporal grounding. Notably, despite having only 8 billion parameters, D-ORCA achieves performance competitive with Qwen3-Omni across several general-purpose audio-visual understanding benchmarks.

Khajavi"], "title": "Digital Twin and Agentic AI for Wild Fire Disaster Management: Intelligent Virtual Situation Room", "comment": null, "summary": "According to the United Nations, wildfire frequency and intensity are projected to increase by approximately 14% by 2030 and 30% by 2050 due to global warming, posing critical threats to life, infrastructure, and ecosystems. Conventional disaster management frameworks rely on static simulations and passive data acquisition, hindering their ability to adapt to arbitrarily evolving wildfire episodes in real-time. To address these limitations, we introduce the Intelligent Virtual Situation Room (IVSR), a bidirectional Digital Twin (DT) platform augmented by autonomous AI agents. The IVSR continuously ingests multisource sensor imagery, weather data, and 3D forest models to create a live virtual replica of the fire environment. A similarity engine powered by AI aligns emerging conditions with a precomputed Disaster Simulation Library, retrieving and calibrating intervention tactics under the watchful eyes of experts. Authorized action-ranging from UAV redeployment to crew reallocation-is cycled back through standardized procedures to the physical layer, completing the loop between response and analysis. We validate IVSR through detailed case-study simulations provided by an industrial partner, demonstrating capabilities in localized incident detection, privacy-preserving playback, collider-based fire-spread projection, and site-specific ML retraining. Our results indicate marked reductions in detection-to-intervention latency and more effective resource coordination versus traditional systems.

Recent studies have shown that using differentiable rewards to directly align the preference of diffusion models yields promising results. However, these methods suffer from (1) inefficient and coarse-grained optimization with (2) high memory consumption. In this work, we first theoretically and empirically identify the key reason of these limitations: the recursive dependence between different steps in the denoising trajectory. Inspired by this insight, we propose EasyTune, which fine-tunes diffusion at each denoising step rather than over the entire trajectory. This decouples the recursive dependence, allowing us to perform (1) a dense and fine-grained, and (2) memory-efficient optimization. Furthermore, the scarcity of preference motion pairs restricts the availability of motion reward model training. To this end, we further introduce a Self-refinement Preference Learning (SPL) mechanism that dynamically identifies preference pairs and conducts preference learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EasyTune outperforms DRaFT-50 by 8.2% in alignment (MM-Dist) improvement while requiring only 31.16% of its additional memory overhead and achieving a 7.3x training speedup.

Despite recent interest in World Models, most available implementations remain publication-specific, severely limiting their reusability, increasing the risk of bugs, and reducing evaluation standardization.

Multi-agent collaboration offers a promising avenue to transcend these boundaries. However, existing frameworks typically rely on prompt-based test-time interactions or multi-role configurations trained with homogeneous parameters, limiting error correction capabilities and strategic diversity. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Agent Reinforced Training and Inference Framework with Self-Search Scaling (MARTI-MARS2), which integrates policy learning with multi-agent tree search by formulating the multi-agent collaborative exploration process as a dynamic and learnable environment. By allowing agents to iteratively explore and refine within the environment, the framework facilitates evolution from parameter-sharing homogeneous multi-role training to heterogeneous multi-agent training, breaking through single-agent capability limits. We also introduce an efficient inference strategy MARTI-MARS2-T+ to fully exploit the scaling potential of multi-agent collaboration at test time. We conduct extensive experiments across varied model scales (8B, 14B, and 32B) on challenging code generation benchmarks. Utilizing two collaborating 32B models, MARTI-MARS2 achieves 77.7%, outperforming strong baselines like GPT-5.1. Furthermore, MARTI-MARS2 reveals a novel scaling law: shifting from single-agent to homogeneous multi-role and ultimately to heterogeneous multi-agent paradigms progressively yields higher RL performance ceilings, robust TTS capabilities, and greater policy diversity, suggesting that policy diversity is critical for scaling intelligence via multi-agent reinforcement learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6MARTI-MARS2\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u540c\u8d28\u591a\u89d2\u8272\u5230\u5f02\u8d28\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6f14\u8fdb\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5bf9\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53RL\u6269\u5c55\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u6216\u540c\u8d28\u53c2\u6570\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7ea0\u9519\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMARTI-MARS2\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u540c\u63a2\u7d22\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6811\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4ece\u540c\u8d28\u591a\u89d2\u8272\u8bad\u7ec3\u5411\u5f02\u8d28\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bad\u7ec3\u6f14\u8fdb\uff1b\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565MARTI-MARS2-T+\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u57288B/14B/32B\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff1b\u4e24\u4e2a32B\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u4e0b\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe77.7%\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8aGPT-5.1\u7b49\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u65b0\u7f29\u653e\u5f8b\uff1a\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u2192\u540c\u8d28\u591a\u89d2\u8272\u2192\u5f02\u8d28\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9010\u6b65\u63d0\u5347RL\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u9650\u3001TTS\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7b56\u7565\u591a\u6837\u6027\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6269\u5c55\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u8981\u7d20\uff1bMARTI-MARS2\u4e3a\u7a81\u7834\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u529b\u6781\u9650\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u540c\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, under ultra-low-dose conditions, the sharply degraded signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in energy-specific projections poses a significant challenge, leading to severe artifacts and loss of structural details in reconstructed images. To address this, we propose FSP-Diff, a full-spectrum prior-enhanced dual-domain latent diffusion framework for ultra-low-dose spectral CT reconstruction. Our framework integrates three core strategies: 1) Complementary Feature Construction: We integrate direct image reconstructions with projection-domain denoised results. While the former preserves latent textural nuances amidst heavy noise, the latter provides a stable structural scaffold to balance detail fidelity and noise suppression. 2) Full-Spectrum Prior Integration: By fusing multi-energy projections into a high-SNR full-spectrum image, we establish a unified structural reference that guides the reconstruction across all energy bins. 3) Efficient Latent Diffusion Synthesis: To alleviate the high computational burden of high-dimensional spectral data, multi-path features are embedded into a compact latent space. This allows the diffusion process to facilitate interactive feature fusion in a lower-dimensional manifold, achieving accelerated reconstruction while maintaining fine-grained detail restoration. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that FSP-Diff significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both image quality and computational efficiency, underscoring its potential for clinically viable ultra-low-dose spectral CT imaging.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFSP-Diff\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u6295\u5f71\u57df\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u57df\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u5f15\u5165\u5168\u8c31\u5148\u9a8c\u53ca\u9ad8\u6548\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8d85\u4f4e\u5242\u91cf\u5149\u5b50\u8ba1\u6570\u80fd\u8c31CT\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d85\u4f4e\u5242\u91cf\u4e0b\u80fd\u8c31CT\u80fd\u91cf\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u6295\u5f71\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u5efa\u56fe\u50cf\u4e25\u91cd\u4f2a\u5f71\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec6\u8282\u4e22\u5931\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5168\u8c31\u5148\u9a8c\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u53cc\u57df\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6FSP-Diff\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e92\u8865\u7279\u5f81\u6784\u5efa\u3001\u5168\u8c31\u5148\u9a8c\u96c6\u6210\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u5408\u6210\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cFSP-Diff\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "FSP-Diff\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u8d85\u4f4e\u5242\u91cf\u80fd\u8c31CT\u6210\u50cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The architecture allows InternAgent-1.5 to operate continuously across extended discovery cycles while maintaining coherent and improving behavior. It also enables the system to coordinate computational modeling and laboratory experimentation within a single unified system. We evaluate InternAgent-1.5 on scientific reasoning benchmarks such as GAIA, HLE, GPQA, and FrontierScience, and the system achieves leading performance that demonstrates strong foundational capabilities. Beyond these benchmarks, we further assess two categories of discovery tasks.

Such loads are characterized by fast workload-driven variability and protection-driven disconnection and reconnection behavior that are not captured by conventional load models. Existing data center load modeling includes physics-based approaches, which provide interpretable structure for grid simulation, and data-driven approaches, which capture empirical workload variability from data. However, physics-based models are typically uncalibrated to facility-level operation, while trajectory alignment in data-driven methods often leads to overfitting and unrealistic dynamic behavior. To resolve these limitations, we design the framework to leverage both physics-based structure and data-driven adaptability. The physics-based structure is parameterized to enable data-driven pattern-consistent calibration from real operational data, supporting facility-level grid planning. We further show that trajectory-level alignment is limited for inherently stochastic data center loads. Therefore, we design the calibration to align temporal and statistical patterns using temporal contrastive learning (TCL). This calibration is performed locally at the facility, and only calibrated parameters are shared with utilities, preserving data privacy. The proposed load model is calibrated by real-world operational load data from the MIT Supercloud, ASU Sol, Blue Waters, and ASHRAE datasets. Then it is integrated into the ANDES platform and evaluated on the IEEE 39-bus, NPCC 140-bus, and WECC 179-bus systems.

Ultra-sparse angular sampling, employed to reduce dose, introduces severe undersampling artifacts and inter-slice inconsistencies, compromising diagnostic reliability. Existing reconstruction methods often struggle to balance angular continuity with spatial detail fidelity. To address these challenges, we propose a Continuity-driven Synergistic Diffusion with Neural priors (CSDN) for ultra-sparse-view CBCT reconstruction. Neural priors are introduced as a structural foundation to encode a continuous threedimensional attenuation representation, enabling the synthesis of physically consistent dense projections from ultra-sparse measurements. Building upon this neural-prior-based initialization, a synergistic diffusion strategy is developed, consisting of two collaborative refinement paths: a Sinogram Refinement Diffusion (Sino-RD) process that restores angular continuity and a Digital Radiography Refinement Diffusion (DR-RD) process that enforces inter-slice consistency from the projection image perspective. The outputs of the two diffusion paths are adaptively fused by the Dual-Projection Reconstruction Fusion (DPRF) module to achieve coherent volumetric reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CSDN effectively suppresses artifacts and recovers fine textures under ultra-sparse-view conditions, outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aContinuity-driven Synergistic Diffusion with Neural priors (CSDN)\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8d85\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u7684\u9525\u5f62\u675fCT\uff08CBCT\uff09\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u5148\u9a8c\u5efa\u6a21\u4e09\u7ef4\u8fde\u7eed\u8870\u51cf\u573a\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u6b63\u5f26\u56fe\u4e0e\u6570\u5b57\u653e\u5c04\u5f71\u50cf\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u89d2\u5ea6\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u4e0e\u5c42\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6291\u5236\u4f2a\u5f71\u5e76\u6062\u590d\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "motivation": "CBCT\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8f90\u5c04\u5242\u91cf\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff1b\u8d85\u7a00\u758f\u89d2\u91c7\u6837\u867d\u964d\u4f4e\u5242\u91cf\uff0c\u5374\u5f15\u53d1\u4e25\u91cd\u6b20\u91c7\u6837\u4f2a\u5f71\u548c\u5c42\u95f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u8bca\u65ad\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCSDN\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u5229\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u5148\u9a8c\u6784\u5efa\u8fde\u7eed\u4e09\u7ef4\u8870\u51cf\u8868\u793a\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u6295\u5f71\uff1b\u7ee7\u800c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u534f\u540c\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6b63\u5f26\u56fe\u7ec6\u5316\u6269\u6563\uff08Sino-RD\uff09\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u653e\u5c04\u5f71\u50cf\u7ec6\u5316\u6269\u6563\uff08DR-RD\uff09\u4e24\u6761\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u6295\u5f71\u91cd\u5efa\u878d\u5408\uff08DPRF\uff09\u6a21\u5757\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8d85\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0cCSDN\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u4f2a\u5f71\u3001\u6062\u590d\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7eb9\u7406\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "CSDN\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u534f\u540c\u6269\u6563\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u9ad8\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u7684\u8d85\u4f4e\u5242\u91cfCBCT\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b89\u5168\u9ad8\u6548\u6210\u50cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a framework for aligning these models with task-specific rewards, improving overall quality and reliability. Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is an efficient, value-function-free alternative to Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) that leverages group-relative reward normalization. We introduce Iterative Group Relative Policy Optimization (iGRPO), a two-stage extension of GRPO that adds dynamic self-conditioning through model-generated drafts. In Stage 1, iGRPO samples multiple exploratory drafts and selects the highest-reward draft using the same scalar reward signal used for optimization. In Stage 2, it appends this best draft to the original prompt and applies a GRPO-style update on draft-conditioned refinements, training the policy to improve beyond its strongest prior attempt. Under matched rollout budgets, iGRPO consistently outperforms GRPO across base models (e.g., Nemotron-H-8B-Base-8K and DeepSeek-R1 Distilled), validating its effectiveness on diverse reasoning benchmarks. Moreover, applying iGRPO to OpenReasoning-Nemotron-7B trained on AceReason-Math achieves new state-of-the-art results of 85.62\\% and 79.64\\% on AIME24 and AIME25, respectively.

However, realizing such soft policies in practice remains challenging. Existing approaches either depend on parametric policies with limited expressivity or employ diffusion-based policies whose intractable likelihoods hinder reliable entropy estimation in soft policy objectives. We address this challenge by directly realizing soft-policy sampling via Langevin dynamics driven by the action gradient of the Q-function. This perspective leads to Langevin Q-Learning (LQL), which samples actions from the target Boltzmann distribution without explicitly parameterizing the policy. However, directly applying Langevin dynamics suffers from slow mixing in high-dimensional and non-convex Q-landscapes, limiting its practical effectiveness. To overcome this, we propose Noise-Conditioned Langevin Q-Learning (NC-LQL), which integrates multi-scale noise perturbations into the value function. NC-LQL learns a noise-conditioned Q-function that induces a sequence of progressively smoothed value landscapes, enabling sampling to transition from global exploration to precise mode refinement. On OpenAI Gym MuJoCo benchmarks, NC-LQL achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods, providing a simple yet powerful solution for online RL.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u8f6f\u7b56\u7565\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u2014\u2014Langevin Q-Learning\uff08LQL\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u4e3aNoise-Conditioned LQL\uff08NC-LQL\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u566a\u58f0\u5e73\u6ed1Q\u51fd\u6570\u666f\u89c2\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u7ef4\u975e\u51f8\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728MuJoCo\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u5148\u8fdb\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8f6f\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff1a\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u5f31\uff0c\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u56e0\u4f3c\u7136\u4e0d\u53ef\u89e3\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u4f30\u8ba1\u71b5\uff1b\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\u5408\u7406\u6027\u53c8\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eQ\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u68af\u5ea6\u9a71\u52a8Langevin\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f6f\u7b56\u7565\u91c7\u6837\uff08LQL\uff09\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5f15\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u7684Q\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5e73\u6ed1Q\u666f\u89c2\u4ee5\u52a0\u901f\u6df7\u5408\uff0c\u5f62\u6210NC-LQL\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728OpenAI Gym MuJoCo\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cNC-LQL\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6269\u6563\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u7ed3\u6784\u66f4\u7b80\u6d01\u3001\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "conclusion": "NC-LQL\u4e3a\u8f6f\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u4e25\u8c28\u3001\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u8f6f\u7b56\u7565\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u91c7\u6837\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f\u3002"}}

Current LLM research is dominated by a paradigm that relies heavily on unidirectional scaling of data size, increasingly encountering bottlenecks in data availability, acquisition cost, and training efficiency. In this work, we argue that the development of AGI is entering a new phase of data-model co-evolution, in which models actively guide data management while high-quality data, in turn, amplifies model capabilities. To implement this vision, we propose a tiered data management framework, designed to support the full LLM training lifecycle across heterogeneous learning objectives and cost constraints. Specifically, we introduce an L0-L4 tiered data management framework, ranging from raw uncurated resources to organized and verifiable knowledge. Importantly, LLMs are fully used in data management processes, such as quality scoring and content editing, to refine data across tiers. Each tier is characterized by distinct data properties, management strategies, and training roles, enabling data to be strategically allocated across LLM training stages, including pre-training, mid-training, and alignment. The framework balances data quality, acquisition cost, and marginal training benefit, providing a systematic approach to scalable and sustainable data management.

Existing methods rely on training-time strategies that do not generalise to unseen constraints during inference, and struggle to handle conditional tasks beyond tabular imputation. While manifold theory offers a principled way to guide generation, current formulations are tied to specific inference-time objectives and are limited to continuous domains. We extend manifold theory to tabular data and expand its scope to handle diverse inference-time objectives. On this foundation, we introduce HARPOON, a tabular diffusion method that guides unconstrained samples along the manifold geometry to satisfy diverse tabular conditions at inference. We validate our theoretical contributions empirically on tasks such as imputation and enforcing inequality constraints, demonstrating HARPOON'S strong performance across diverse datasets and the practical benefits of manifold-aware guidance for tabular data.

However, existing methods remain limited to relatively simple editing operations, hindering real-world applications that require complex and compositional instructions. In this work, we address these limitations from the perspectives of architectural design, data, and evaluation protocols. Specifically, we identify two key challenges in current models: insufficient instruction compliance and background inconsistency. To this end, we propose MCIE-E1, a Multimodal Large Language Model-Driven Complex Instruction Image Editing method that integrates two key modules: a spatial-aware cross-attention module and a background-consistent cross-attention module. The former enhances instruction-following capability by explicitly aligning semantic instructions with spatial regions through spatial guidance during the denoising process, while the latter preserves features in unedited regions to maintain background consistency. To enable effective training, we construct a dedicated data pipeline to mitigate the scarcity of complex instruction-based image editing datasets, combining fine-grained automatic filtering via a powerful MLLM with rigorous human validation. Finally, to comprehensively evaluate complex instruction-based image editing, we introduce CIE-Bench, a new benchmark with two new evaluation metrics.

However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on general domain visual fidelity, leaving the evaluation of state transitions and temporal coherence in GUI-specific contexts underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce GEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating dynamic interaction and temporal coherence in GUI generation. GEBench comprises 700 carefully curated samples spanning five task categories, covering both single-step interactions and multi-step trajectories across real-world and fictional scenarios, as well as grounding point localization. To support systematic evaluation, we propose GE-Score, a novel five-dimensional metric that assesses Goal Achievement, Interaction Logic, Content Consistency, UI Plausibility, and Visual Quality. Extensive evaluations on current models indicate that while they perform well on single-step transitions, they struggle significantly with maintaining temporal coherence and spatial grounding over longer interaction sequences.

Automated detection can increase reproducibility and support scalable early screening programs, but supervised deep learning methods are limited by small labelled datasets. This study assesses whether ultrasound-specific self-supervised pretraining can facilitate accurate, robust deep learning detection of cystic hygroma in first-trimester ultrasound images. We fine-tuned the Ultrasound Self-Supervised Foundation Model with Masked Autoencoding (USF-MAE), pretrained on over 370,000 unlabelled ultrasound images, for binary classification of normal controls and cystic hygroma cases used in this study. Performance was evaluated on the same curated ultrasound dataset, preprocessing pipeline, and 4-fold cross-validation protocol as for the DenseNet-169 baseline, using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC). Model interpretability was analyzed qualitatively using Score-CAM visualizations. USF-MAE outperformed the DenseNet-169 baseline on all evaluation metrics. The proposed model yielded a mean accuracy of 0.96, sensitivity of 0.94, specificity of 0.98, and ROC-AUC of 0.98 compared to 0.93, 0.92, 0.94, and 0.94 for the DenseNet-169 baseline, respectively. Qualitative Score-CAM visualizations of model predictions demonstrated clinical relevance by highlighting expected regions in the fetal neck for both positive and negative cases.

Existing anti-exploration methods count continuous state-action pairs by discretizing these data, but often suffer from the issues of dimension disaster and information loss in the discretization process, leading to efficiency and performance reduction, and even failure of policy learning. In this paper, a novel anti-exploration method based on Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQVAE) and fuzzy clustering in offline RL is proposed. We first propose an efficient pseudo-count method based on the multi-codebook VQVAE to discretize state-action pairs, and design an offline RL anti-exploitation method based on the proposed pseudo-count method to handle the dimension disaster issue and improve the learning efficiency. In addition, a codebook update mechanism based on fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering is developed to improve the use rate of vectors in codebooks, addressing the information loss issue in the discretization process. The proposed method is evaluated on the benchmark of Datasets for Deep Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning (D4RL), and experimental results show that the proposed method performs better and requires less computing cost in multiple complex tasks compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eVQVAE\u4e0e\u6a21\u7cca\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u53cd\u63a2\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7801\u672cVQVAE\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4f2a\u8ba1\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408FCM\u805a\u7c7b\u66f4\u65b0\u7801\u672c\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u7ef4\u5ea6\u707e\u96be\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728D4RL\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u7684\u4f2a\u8ba1\u6570\u53cd\u63a2\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8fde\u7eed\u72b6\u6001-\u52a8\u4f5c\u5bf9\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u7ef4\u5ea6\u707e\u96be\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6548\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u751a\u81f3\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u7801\u672cVQVAE\u7684\u4f2a\u8ba1\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u72b6\u6001-\u52a8\u4f5c\u5bf9\u79bb\u6563\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u53cd\u63a2\u7d22\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u7ccaC\u5747\u503c\uff08FCM\uff09\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u7801\u672c\u66f4\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u7801\u672c\u5411\u91cf\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728D4RL\u57fa\u51c6\u591a\u4e2a\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\uff08SOTA\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u66f4\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u4e2d\u4f2a\u8ba1\u6570\u56e0\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\u707e\u96be\u4e0e\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u53cd\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Most existing methods enforce physical validity through soft penalties, creating an intrinsic trade-off between geometric feasibility and physical plausibility: penalizing collisions often distorts mesh structure, while preserving shape leads to interpenetration. To resolve this conflict, we present PhysDrape, a hybrid neural-physical solver for physically realistic garment draping driven by explicit forces and constraints. Unlike soft-constrained frameworks, PhysDrape integrates neural inference with explicit geometric solvers in a fully differentiable pipeline. Specifically, we propose a Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network conditioned on a physics-enriched graph -- encoding material parameters and body proximity -- to predict residual displacements. Crucially, we integrate a differentiable two-stage solver: first, a learnable Force Solver iteratively resolves unbalanced forces derived from the Saint Venant-Kirchhoff (StVK) model to ensure quasi-static equilibrium; second, a Differentiable Projection strictly enforces collision constraints against the body surface. This differentiable design guarantees physical validity through explicit constraints, while enabling end-to-end learning to optimize the network for physically consistent predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhysDrape achieves state-of-the-art performance, ensuring negligible interpenetration with significantly lower strain energy compared to existing baselines, achieving superior physical fidelity and robustness in real-time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PhysDrape\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0e\u663e\u5f0f\u7269\u7406\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u65e0\u7a7f\u900f\u7684\u670d\u88c5\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u62df\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9884\u6d4b\u6b8b\u5dee\u4f4d\u79fb\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5fae\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff08\u529b\u5e73\u8861\u6c42\u89e3 + \u78b0\u649e\u6295\u5f71\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u51e0\u4f55\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u670d\u88c5\u4eff\u771f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8f6f\u7ea6\u675f\u5904\u7406\u78b0\u649e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u51e0\u4f55\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u77db\u76fe\uff1a\u5f3a\u60e9\u7f5a\u6613\u626d\u66f2\u7f51\u683c\uff0c\u5f31\u60e9\u7f5a\u5219\u5f15\u53d1\u7a7f\u900f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPhysDrape\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u7269\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u56fe\uff08\u542b\u6750\u6599\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u4eba\u4f53\u90bb\u8fd1\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u6b8b\u5dee\u4f4d\u79fb\uff1b2\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u5fae\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u2014\u2014\u5148\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eStVK\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u529b\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u8fbe\u6210\u51c6\u9759\u6001\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u53ef\u5fae\u6295\u5f71\u4e25\u683c\u6ee1\u8db3\u4eba\u4f53\u8868\u9762\u78b0\u649e\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660ePhysDrape\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6781\u4f4e\u7a7f\u900f\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5e94\u53d8\u80fd\uff0c\u7269\u7406\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "PhysDrape\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u663e\u5f0f\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u53ef\u5fae\u5b66\u4e60\u6df1\u5ea6\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u670d\u88c5\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u78b0\u649e\u5904\u7406\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u7269\u7406\u4eff\u771f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

We argue that this tax primarily arises from continual-learning-style forgetting in sequential alignment, where distribution shift and conflicting objectives cause safety updates to overwrite pre-trained competencies. Accordingly, we cast safety alignment as a continual learning (CL) problem that must balance plasticity (acquiring safety constraints) and stability (preserving general abilities). We propose Orthogonal Gradient Projection for Safety Alignment (OGPSA), a lightweight method that mitigates interference by constraining each safety update to be orthogonal (in a first-order sense) to a learned subspace capturing general capabilities. Specifically, OGPSA estimates a low-rank capability subspace from gradients on a small reference set and projects the safety gradient onto its orthogonal complement before updating. This produces safety-directed updates that minimally perturb prior knowledge while retaining capacity for alignment. OGPSA is plug-and-play and integrates into standard post-training pipelines without large-scale replay, auxiliary objectives, or retraining. Across Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and sequential SFT$\\rightarrow$DPO settings, OGPSA consistently improves the safety--utility Pareto frontier over standard baselines. For instance, on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct under SFT$\\rightarrow$DPO, OGPSA preserves strong safety while recovering general capability, improving SimpleQA from 0.53\\% to 3.03\\% and IFEval from 51.94\\% to 63.96\\%.

Existing VLLMs acceleration frameworks usually compress spatial and temporal redundancy independently, which overlooks the spatiotemporal relationships, thereby leading to suboptimal spatiotemporal compression. The highly correlated visual features are likely to change in spatial position, scale, orientation, and other attributes over time due to the dynamic nature of video. Building on this insight, we introduce FlashVID, a training-free inference acceleration framework for VLLMs. Specifically, FlashVID utilizes Attention and Diversity-based Token Selection (ADTS) to select the most representative tokens for basic video representation, then applies Tree-based Spatiotemporal Token Merging (TSTM) for fine-grained spatiotemporal redundancy elimination. Extensive experiments conducted on three representative VLLMs across five video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method. Notably, by retaining only 10% of visual tokens, FlashVID preserves 99.1% of the performance of LLaVA-OneVision. Consequently, FlashVID can serve as a training-free and plug-and-play module for extending long video frames, which enables a 10x increase in video frame input to Qwen2.5-VL, resulting in a relative improvement of 8.6% within the same computational budget.

To address this gap, we introduce MIND, the first open-domain closed-loop revisited benchmark for evaluating Memory consIstency and action coNtrol in worlD models. MIND contains 250 high-quality videos at 1080p and 24 FPS, including 100 (first-person) + 100 (third-person) video clips under a shared action space and 25 + 25 clips across varied action spaces covering eight diverse scenes. We design an efficient evaluation framework to measure two core abilities: memory consistency and action control, capturing temporal stability and contextual coherence across viewpoints. Furthermore, we design various action spaces, including different character movement speeds and camera rotation angles, to evaluate the action generalization capability across different action spaces under shared scenes. To facilitate future performance benchmarking on MIND, we introduce MIND-World, a novel interactive Video-to-World baseline. Extensive experiments demonstrate the completeness of MIND and reveal key challenges in current world models, including the difficulty of maintaining long-term memory consistency and generalizing across action spaces.

While recent LLM-based agents show promise, current prompt-based agents for MLE suffer from behavioral stagnation due to frozen parameters. Although Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a remedy, applying it to MLE is hindered by prohibitive execution latency and inefficient data selection. Recognizing these challenges, we propose AceGRPO with two core components: (1) Evolving Data Buffer that continuously repurposes execution traces into reusable training tasks, and (2) Adaptive Sampling guided by a Learnability Potential function, which dynamically prioritizes tasks at the agent's learning frontier to maximize learning efficiency. Leveraging AceGRPO, our trained Ace-30B model achieves a 100% valid submission rate on MLE-Bench-Lite, approaches the performance of proprietary frontier models, and outperforms larger open-source baselines (e.g., DeepSeek-V3.2), demonstrating robust capability for sustained iterative optimization.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have recently demonstrated strong potential in synthesizing realistic visual data. However, they often struggle to capture complex and diverse data distributions, particularly in scenarios involving incomplete inputs or significant missing regions. These challenges arise mainly from the high computational requirements and the difficulty of modeling heterogeneous and structurally intricate data, which restrict their applicability in real-world settings. Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have emerged as a promising solution to these limitations. By dynamically selecting and activating the most relevant expert sub-networks for a given input, MoEs improve both performance and efficiency. In this paper, we investigate the integration of Deep 3D Convolutional GANs (CGANs) with a MoE framework to generate high-quality 3D models and reconstruct incomplete or damaged objects. The proposed architecture incorporates multiple generators, each specialized to capture distinct modalities within the dataset. Furthermore, an auxiliary loss-free dynamic capacity constraint (DCC) mechanism is introduced to guide the selection of categorical generators, ensuring a balance between specialization, training stability, and computational efficiency, which is critical for 3D voxel processing. We evaluated the model's ability to generate and complete shapes with missing regions of varying sizes and compared its performance with state-of-the-art approaches.

However, its widespread adoption is hindered by a reliance on untestable causal assumptions and by the lack of robustness-oriented evaluation in existing benchmarks. To address these challenges, we propose CausalCompass, a flexible and extensible benchmark suite designed to assess the robustness of time-series causal discovery (TSCD) methods under violations of modeling assumptions. To demonstrate the practical utility of CausalCompass, we conduct extensive benchmarking of representative TSCD algorithms across eight assumption-violation scenarios. Our experimental results indicate that no single method consistently attains optimal performance across all settings. Nevertheless, the methods exhibiting superior overall performance across diverse scenarios are almost invariably deep learning-based approaches. We further provide hyperparameter sensitivity analyses to deepen the understanding of these findings. We also find, somewhat surprisingly, that NTS-NOTEARS relies heavily on standardized preprocessing in practice, performing poorly in the vanilla setting but exhibiting strong performance after standardization. Finally, our work aims to provide a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of TSCD methods under assumption violations, thereby facilitating their broader adoption in real-world applications.

However, existing equivariant ViTs often struggle to balance performance with equivariance, primarily due to the challenge of achieving holistic equivariant modifications across the diverse modules in ViTs-particularly in harmonizing the Self-Attention mechanism with Patch Embedding. To address this, we propose a straightforward framework that systematically renders key ViT components, including patch embedding, self-attention, positional encodings, and Down/Up-Sampling, equivariant, thereby constructing ViTs with guaranteed equivariance. The resulting architecture serves as a plug-and-play replacement that is both theoretically grounded and practically versatile, scaling seamlessly even to Swin Transformers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our equivariant ViTs consistently improve performance and data efficiency across a wide spectrum of vision tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u4f7fViT\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff08\u5982Patch Embedding\u3001Self-Attention\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\uff09\u4fdd\u6301\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u51fa\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u7b49\u53d8ViT\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7b49\u53d8ViT\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u534f\u8c03Self-Attention\u4e0ePatch Embedding\u7b49\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6a21\u5757\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u5c06ViT\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff08\u5305\u62ecpatch embedding\u3001self-attention\u3001positional encodings\u3001Down/Up-Sampling\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e3a\u7b49\u53d8\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5177\u5907\u4e25\u683c\u7b49\u53d8\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684ViT\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u65e0\u7f1d\u6269\u5c55\u81f3Swin Transformer\u7b49\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u7b49\u53d8ViT\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e00\u81f4\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u9762\u7b49\u53d8\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1ViT\u6838\u5fc3\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u53ef\u517c\u987e\u7406\u8bba\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7b49\u53d8\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Motivated by classical mechanics, we introduce Kinetic Path Energy (KPE), an action-like, per-sample diagnostic that measures the accumulated kinetic effort along an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) trajectory. Empirically, KPE exhibits two robust correspondences: (i) higher KPE predicts stronger semantic fidelity; (ii) high-KPE trajectories terminate on low-density manifold frontiers. We further provide theoretical guarantees linking trajectory energy to data density. Paradoxically, this correlation is non-monotonic. At sufficiently high energy, generation can degenerate into memorization. Leveraging the closed-form of empirical flow matching, we show that extreme energies drive trajectories toward near-copies of training examples. This yields a Goldilocks principle and motivates Kinetic Trajectory Shaping (KTS), a training-free two-phase inference strategy that boosts early motion and enforces a late-time soft landing, reducing memorization and improving generation quality across benchmark tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u6d41\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u52a8\u80fd\u8def\u5f84\u80fd\u91cf\uff08KPE\uff09\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0KPE\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\u4f46\u4e0e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5448\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u8fc7\u9ad8KPE\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\uff0c\u636e\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565KTS\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u7ecf\u5178\u529b\u5b66\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u5c06\u6d41\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u89c6\u4e3a\u7c92\u5b50\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u5230\u6570\u636e\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u7269\u7406\u91cf\uff08\u5982\u52a8\u80fd\uff09\u6765\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u751f\u6210\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49Kinetic Path Energy (KPE)\u4f5c\u4e3aODE\u91c7\u6837\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0a\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u52a8\u80fd\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790KPE\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684Kinetic Trajectory Shaping (KTS)\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u589e\u5f3a\u65e9\u671f\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u65bd\u52a0\u665a\u671f\u8f6f\u7740\u9646\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a(i) KPE\u8d8a\u9ad8\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6837\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u8d8a\u5f3a\uff1b(ii) \u9ad8KPE\u8f68\u8ff9\u843d\u70b9\u4f4d\u4e8e\u4f4e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6d41\u5f62\u524d\u6cbf\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660eKPE\u4e0e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5b58\u5728\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u5173\u8054\uff1b\u8fc7\u9ad8KPE\u5f15\u53d1\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\uff1bKTS\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3002", "conclusion": "KPE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u5177\u7269\u7406\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff1b\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u9075\u5faa\u2018\u9ec4\u91d1\u6cd5\u5219\u2019\u2014\u2014KPE\u9700\u9002\u4e2d\uff1bKTS\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u89c6\u89d2\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Next, by integrating Chain-of-Thought and Reflection prompting (CoT + Reflection), Gemini 2.5 Pro automatically generates pseudo-labels and reasoning texts that serve as weak supervision for downstream models. Subsequently, OpenPose produces 137-dimensional key-point sequences, augmented with inter-frame offset features; the usual graph neural network backbone is simplified to an MLP to efficiently model the spatiotemporal relationships of the three key-point streams. An ultra-long-sequence Transformer independently encodes both the image and key-point sequences, and their representations are concatenated with BERT-encoded interview transcripts. Each modality is first pre-trained in isolation, then fine-tuned jointly, with pseudo-labeled samples merged into the training set for further gains. Experiments demonstrate that, despite severe class imbalance, the proposed approach lifts accuracy from under 0.6 in prior work to over 0.69, establishing a new public benchmark.

Traditional machine learning (ML) models, though widely applied to PD detection, often rely on extensive feature engineering and struggle to capture complex feature interactions. This study investigates the effectiveness of attention-based deep learning models for early PD detection using tabular biomedical data. We present a comparative evaluation of four classification models: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Gradient Boosting, TabNet, and SAINT, using a benchmark dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository consisting of biomedical voice measurements from PD patients and healthy controls.\n  Experimental results show that SAINT consistently outperformed all baseline models across multiple evaluation metrics, achieving a weighted precision of 0.98, weighted recall of 0.97, weighted F1-score of 0.97, a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.9990, and the highest Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC). TabNet and MLP demonstrated competitive performance, while Gradient Boosting yielded the lowest overall scores. The superior performance of SAINT is attributed to its dual attention mechanism, which effectively models feature interactions within and across samples.\n  These findings demonstrate the diagnostic potential of attention-based deep learning architectures for early Parkinson's disease detection and highlight the importance of dynamic feature representation in clinical prediction tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\uff08PD\uff09\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0SAINT\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u9879\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eMLP\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u548cTabNet\u7b49\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u5f52\u529f\u4e8e\u5176\u53cc\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e9\u671f\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u75c7\u72b6\u9690\u533f\u3001\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u56db\u79cd\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLP\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3001TabNet\u3001SAINT\uff09\u5728UCI\u8bed\u97f3\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5206\u6790SAINT\u7684\u53cc\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5982\u4f55\u5efa\u6a21\u6837\u672c\u5185\u4e0e\u6837\u672c\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "result": "SAINT\u5728\u52a0\u6743\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\uff080.98\uff09\u3001\u52a0\u6743\u53ec\u56de\u7387\uff080.97\uff09\u3001\u52a0\u6743F1\u5206\u6570\uff080.97\uff09\u3001MCC\uff080.9990\uff09\u53caAUC-ROC\u4e0a\u5747\u6700\u4f18\uff1bTabNet\u548cMLP\u6b21\u4e4b\uff0c\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662fSAINT\uff09\u5728\u65e9\u671fPD\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u5f81\u5bf9\u4e34\u5e8a\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

In Part~I of this series, we modeled learning as a transport process in the space of parameter distributions and derived the Epistemic Speed Limit, which lower-bounds entropy production under finite-time learning.\n  In this work (Part~II), we study the consequences of this irreversibility for continual learning from a trajectory-level perspective. We show that finite dissipation constrains not only which solutions are reachable, but which learning paths remain dynamically accessible.\n  Although a continuum of task-equivalent realizations can achieve identical task performance, finite-time learning irreversibly selects among these realizations. This selection occurs through the progressive elimination of degrees of freedom that would otherwise enable structural reconfiguration. We refer to this phenomenon as \\emph{critical period closure}: beyond a certain stage of learning, transitions between compatible representations become dynamically inaccessible under any finite dissipation budget.\n  As a result, continual learning failure arises not from the absence of solutions satisfying multiple tasks, but from an irreversible loss of representational freedom induced by prior learning. This reframes catastrophic forgetting as a dynamical constraint imposed by finite-time dissipation, rather than direct task interference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\uff08Part II\uff09\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u6027\u5bf9\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u201c\u5173\u952e\u671f\u5173\u95ed\u201d\u73b0\u8c61\uff1a\u6709\u9650\u8017\u6563\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b66\u4e60\u8def\u5f84\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u671f\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u517c\u5bb9\u8868\u793a\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u5207\u6362\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f15\u53d1\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "motivation": "\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u5b66\u4e60\u5fc5\u7136\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\uff0cPart I\u5df2\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u8ba4\u77e5\u901f\u5ea6\u6781\u9650\uff1b\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7a76\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u4ece\u8f68\u8ff9\u5c42\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5b66\u4e60\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u53c2\u6570\u5206\u5e03\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u71b5\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0e\u6709\u9650\u8017\u6563\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4ece\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8def\u5f84\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6709\u9650\u8017\u6563\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9650\u5236\u53ef\u8fbe\u89e3\uff0c\u66f4\u9650\u5236\u53ef\u8fbe\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8def\u5f84\uff1b\u4efb\u52a1\u7b49\u4ef7\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ec5\u90e8\u5206\u88ab\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u5b66\u4e60\u9009\u4e2d\uff1b\u968f\u7740\u5b66\u4e60\u63a8\u8fdb\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7ed3\u6784\u91cd\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u88ab\u9010\u6b65\u6d88\u9664\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u2018\u5173\u952e\u671f\u5173\u95ed\u2019\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u5931\u8d25\u6e90\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u5b66\u4e60\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u4e27\u5931\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u76f4\u63a5\u5e72\u6270\uff1b\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u672c\u8d28\u662f\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u8017\u6563\u65bd\u52a0\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7ea6\u675f\u3002"}}

In deployed platforms, this raises copyright and intellectual-property risks and calls for reliable protection. However, existing countermeasures either require costly weight editing as new styles emerge or rely on an explicitly specified editing style, limiting their practicality for deployment-side safety. To address this challenge, we propose DICE (Disentanglement of artist Style from Content via Contrastive Subspace Decomposition), a training-free framework for on-the-fly artist style erasure. Unlike style editing that require an explicitly specified replacement style, DICE performs style purification, removing the artist's characteristics while preserving the user-intended content. Our core insight is that a model cannot truly comprehend the artist style from a single text or image alone. Consequently, we abandon the traditional paradigm of identifying style from isolated samples. Instead, we construct contrastive triplets to compel the model to distinguish between style and non-style features in the latent space. By formalizing this disentanglement process as a solvable generalized eigenvalue problem, we achieve precise identification of the style subspace. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive Attention Decoupling Editing strategy dynamically assesses the style concentration of each token and performs differential suppression and content enhancement on the QKV vectors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DICE achieves a superior balance between the thoroughness of style erasure and the preservation of content integrity. DICE introduces an additional overhead of only 3 seconds to disentangle style, providing a practical and efficient technique for curbing style mimicry.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDICE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u65f6\u64e6\u9664\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u89e3\u5b9e\u73b0\u98ce\u683c\u4e0e\u5185\u5bb9\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u89e3\u8026\u7f16\u8f91\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5185\u5bb9\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u9ad8\u6548\u53bb\u9664\u672a\u7ecf\u6388\u6743\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u6a21\u4eff\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u666e\u53ca\u5bfc\u81f4\u672a\u7ecf\u6388\u6743\u7684\u827a\u672f\u98ce\u683c\u6a21\u4eff\u6cdb\u6ee5\uff0c\u5e26\u6765\u7248\u6743\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u98ce\u9669\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u62a4\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u6602\u8d35\u6743\u91cd\u7f16\u8f91\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56\u663e\u5f0f\u6307\u5b9a\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDICE\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u98ce\u683c-\u5185\u5bb9\u89e3\u8026\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u6784\u5efa\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u533a\u5206\u98ce\u683c\u4e0e\u975e\u98ce\u683c\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u5e7f\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u95ee\u9898\u4ee5\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u98ce\u683c\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u89e3\u8026\u7f16\u8f91\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u5404token\u98ce\u683c\u6d53\u5ea6\uff0c\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u6291\u5236QKV\u5411\u91cf\u4e2d\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u6210\u5206\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u5185\u5bb9\u6210\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eDICE\u5728\u98ce\u683c\u64e6\u9664\u5f7b\u5e95\u6027\u4e0e\u5185\u5bb9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u4f18\u5e73\u8861\uff1b\u4ec5\u589e\u52a03\u79d2\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DICE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u4fa7\u98ce\u683c\u9632\u62a4\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u904f\u5236\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u76d7\u7528\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Consequently, this multi-task scenario requires addressing critical questions: which tasks are similar, and how and why do they exhibit similarity? In this work, we propose a multi-task similarity measure based on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, specifically Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) curves.\n  ALE curves are compared using the Fr\u00e9chet distance, weighted by the data distribution, and the resulting similarity measure incorporates the importance of each feature. The measure is applicable in both single-task learning scenarios, where each task is trained separately, and multi-task learning scenarios, where all tasks are learned simultaneously. The measure is model-agnostic, allowing the use of different machine learning models across tasks. A scaling factor is introduced to account for differences in predictive performance across tasks, and several recommendations are provided for applying the measure in complex scenarios.\n  We validate this measure using four datasets, one synthetic dataset and three real-world datasets. The real-world datasets include a well-known Parkinson's dataset and a bike-sharing usage dataset -- both structured in tabular format -- as well as the CelebA dataset, which is used to evaluate the application of concept bottleneck encoders in a multitask learning setting.

In long-horizon settings, however, payoffs are shaped by latent strategic externalities that evolve over time, so myopic optimization and variation-based regret analyses can become vacuous even when the dynamics are predictable. To solve this problem, we introduce Implicit Strategic Optimization (ISO), a prediction-aware framework in which each agent forecasts the current strategic context and uses it to update its policy online. ISO combines a Strategic Reward Model (SRM) that estimates the long-run strategic value of actions with iso-grpo, a context-conditioned optimistic learning rule. We prove sublinear contextual regret and equilibrium convergence guarantees whose dominant terms scale with the number of context mispredictions; when prediction errors are bounded, our bounds recover the static-game rates obtained when strategic externalities are known.

Existing methods typically adapt pre-trained video models using camera poses relative to a fixed reference, e.g., the first frame. However, these encodings lack shift-invariance, often leading to poor generalization and accumulated drift. While relative camera pose embeddings defined between arbitrary view pairs offer a more robust alternative, integrating them into pre-trained video diffusion models without prohibitive training costs or architectural changes remains challenging. We introduce ReRoPE, a plug-and-play framework that incorporates relative camera information into pre-trained video diffusion models without compromising their generation capability. Our approach is based on the insight that Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) in existing models underutilize their full spectral bandwidth, particularly in the low-frequency components. By seamlessly injecting relative camera pose information into these underutilized bands, ReRoPE achieves precise control while preserving strong pre-trained generative priors. We evaluate our method on both image-to-video (I2V) and video-to-video (V2V) tasks in terms of camera control accuracy and visual fidelity. Our results demonstrate that ReRoPE offers a training-efficient path toward controllable, high-fidelity video generation.

Learning in this setting proceeds by first computing (a subset of) the possible combinations of labels that satisfy the formula and then computing a loss using those combinations and the classifiers' scores. One challenge is that the space of label combinations can grow exponentially, making learning difficult. We propose a technique that prunes this space by exploiting the intuition that instances with similar latent representations are likely to share the same label. While this intuition has been widely used in weakly supervised learning, its application in our setting is challenging due to label dependencies imposed by logical constraints. We formulate the pruning process as an integer linear program that discards inconsistent label combinations while respecting logical structure. Our approach, CLIPPER, is orthogonal to existing training algorithms and can be seamlessly integrated with them. Across 16 benchmarks over complex neurosymbolic tasks, we demonstrate that CLIPPER boosts the performance of state-of-the-art neurosymbolic engines like Scallop, Dolphin, and ISED by up to 48%, 53%, and 8%, leading to state-of-the-art accuracies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCLIPPER\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u4fee\u526a\u6ee1\u8db3\u903b\u8f91\u516c\u5f0f\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u7ec4\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u76f8\u4f3c\u9690\u8868\u793a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5171\u4eab\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u76f4\u89c9\uff0c\u572816\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u5f15\u64ce\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u9690\u542b\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\u9700\u6ee1\u8db3\u903b\u8f91\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u6ee1\u8db3\u516c\u5f0f\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u7ec4\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u53ef\u80fd\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b66\u4e60\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCLIPPER\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5c06\u6807\u7b7e\u7ec4\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u526a\u679d\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u903b\u8f91\u7ed3\u6784\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5254\u9664\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7ec4\u5408\uff1b\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b97\u6cd5\u6b63\u4ea4\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u572816\u4e2a\u590d\u6742\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u4efb\u52a1\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cCLIPPER\u4f7fScallop\u3001Dolphin\u548cISED\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u534748%\u300153%\u548c8%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "CLIPPER\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u903b\u8f91\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u6807\u7b7e\u7ec4\u5408\u7206\u70b8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u9690\u8868\u793a\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4e0e\u903b\u8f91\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u96c6\u6210\u6027\u3002"}}

Prior attempts to combine their strengths typically lead to a stability-performance trade-off. We attribute this phenomenon to a structural incompatibility within a single-stream design: Any application of the Post-Norm operation inevitably obstructs the clean identity gradient preserved by Pre-Norm. To fundamentally reconcile these paradigms, we propose SiameseNorm, a two-stream architecture that couples Pre-Norm-like and Post-Norm-like streams with shared parameters. This design decouples the optimization dynamics of the two streams, retaining the distinct characteristics of both Pre-Norm and Post-Norm by enabling all residual blocks to receive combined gradients inherited from both paradigms, where one stream secures stability while the other enhances expressivity. Extensive pre-training experiments on 1.3B-parameter models demonstrate that SiameseNorm exhibits exceptional optimization robustness and consistently outperforms strong baselines.

This works in static regimes but breaks under distributional shift, task permutation, and continual learning, where even mild topological changes can invalidate learned solutions and trigger catastrophic forgetting. We propose Metric-Topology Factorization (MTF) as a unifying geometric principle: intelligence is not navigation through a fixed maze, but the ability to reshape representational geometry so desired behaviors become stable attractors. Learning corresponds to metric contraction (a controlled deformation of Riemannian structure), while task identity and environmental variation are encoded topologically and stored separately in memory. We show any fixed metric is geometrically incomplete: for any local metric representation, some topological transformations make it singular or incoherent, implying an unavoidable stability-plasticity tradeoff for weight-based systems. MTF resolves this by factorizing stable topology from plastic metric warps, enabling rapid adaptation via geometric switching rather than re-optimization. Building on this, we introduce the Topological Urysohn Machine (TUM), implementing MTF through memory-amortized metric inference (MAMI): spectral task signatures index amortized metric transformations, letting a single learned geometry be reused across permuted, reflected, or parity-altered environments. This explains robustness to task reordering, resistance to catastrophic forgetting, and generalization across transformations that defeat conventional continual learning methods (e.g., EWC).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMetric-Topology Factorization\uff08MTF\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3b\u5f20\u667a\u80fd\u672c\u8d28\u5728\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u5851\u8868\u5f81\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u800c\u975e\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u4f18\u5316\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u53ef\u5851\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u5f62\u53d8\u89e3\u8026\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u6784\u5efaTopological Urysohn Machine\uff08TUM\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bb0\u5fc6\u644a\u9500\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\uff08MAMI\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u6297\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u4e0e\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u7b49\u540c\u4e8e\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u8868\u5f81\u51e0\u4f55\u4e2d\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u91cd\u6392\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6613\u5931\u6548\u5e76\u5f15\u53d1\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u8868\u5f81\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u65b0\u539f\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMetric-Topology Factorization\uff08MTF\uff09\u51e0\u4f55\u539f\u7406\uff1a\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u8eab\u4efd\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u800c\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u9ece\u66fc\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6536\u7f29\uff08metric contraction\uff09\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bbe\u8ba1Topological Urysohn Machine\uff08TUM\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8c31\u4efb\u52a1\u7b7e\u540d\u7d22\u5f15\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u644a\u9500\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\uff08MAMI\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u4efb\u4f55\u56fa\u5b9a\u5ea6\u91cf\u5728\u62d3\u6251\u53d8\u6362\u4e0b\u5fc5\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u5947\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6743\u503c\u7cfb\u7edf\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027-\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u6743\u8861\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eTUM\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u3001\u53cd\u5c04/\u5947\u5076\u53d8\u6362\u73af\u5883\u53ca\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eEWC\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u667a\u80fd\u4e0d\u5e94\u88ab\u7406\u89e3\u4e3a\u5728\u9759\u6001\u51e0\u4f55\u4e2d\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u800c\u5e94\u662f\u5b9e\u65f6\u91cd\u6784\u8868\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff1bMTF\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u62d3\u6251\u4e0e\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u667a\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u7840\uff0cTUM\u662f\u5176\u9996\u4e2a\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u67b6\u6784\u3002"}}

Although existing approaches address imbalance through resampling or cost-sensitive learning during training, they require retraining or access to labeled target data when class distributions shift at deployment time, a common occurrence in real-world applications such as fraud detection, medical diagnosis, and anomaly detection. We present \\textit{Online Bayesian Imbalanced Learning} (OBIL), a principled framework that decouples likelihood-ratio estimation from class-prior assumptions, enabling real-time adaptation to distribution shifts without model retraining. Our approach builds on the established connection between Bregman divergences and proper scoring rules to show that deep networks trained with such losses produce posterior probability estimates from which prior-invariant likelihood ratios can be extracted. We prove that these likelihood-ratio estimates remain valid under arbitrary changes in class priors and cost structures, requiring only a threshold adjustment for optimal Bayes decisions. We derive finite-sample regret bounds demonstrating that OBIL achieves $O(\\sqrt{T \\log T})$ regret against an oracle with perfect prior knowledge.

Despite this progress, it remains unclear which compositional problems are learnable in this setting using outcome-level feedback alone. In this work, we theoretically study the learnability of compositional problems in autoregressive models under RLVR training. We identify a quantity that we call the task-advantage ratio, a joint property of the compositional problem and the base model, that characterizes which tasks and compositions are learnable from outcome-level feedback. On the positive side, using this characterization, we show that compositional problems where correct intermediate steps provide a clear advantage are efficiently learnable with RLVR.

That centroid distance matches probe performance indicates class separation is a mean shift, making detection geometric rather than learned.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u2018\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u2019\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5728\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4ee5\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u5206\u7684\u5747\u503c\u504f\u79fb\u5f62\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u51e0\u4f55\u5ea6\u91cf\uff08\u5982\u8d28\u5fc3\u8ddd\u79bb\uff09\u9ad8\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u77e5\u9053\u7b54\u6848\u6b63\u786e\u4e0e\u5426\uff0c\u8fdc\u8d85\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u2018\u77e5\u9053\u2019\u5176\u751f\u6210\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u8868\u9762\u8f93\u51fa\uff1b\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u5982\u4f55\u8868\u5f81\u548c\u533a\u5206\u6b63\u786e\u4e0e\u9519\u8bef\u9648\u8ff0\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u67909\u4e2a\u6765\u81ea5\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u65cf\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u5c42\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u3001\u8d28\u5fc3\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\u3001\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\uff08activation steering\uff09\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u523b\u753b\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3001\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u53ca\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\u96c6\u4e2d\u57283\u20138\u7ef4\u7ebf\u6027\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u8d28\u5fc3\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0e\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u6027\u80fd\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff08AUC 0.90\uff09\uff1b\u4ec5\u970025\u4e2a\u6807\u6ce8\u6837\u672c\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u5168\u6570\u636e90%\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u53ef\u4f7f\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u53d8\u531610.9\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff1b\u5185\u90e8\u63a2\u9488AUC\u8fbe0.80\u20130.97\uff0c\u800c\u8f93\u51fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec50.44\u20130.64\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u5b58\u5728\u6e05\u6670\u3001\u4f4e\u7ef4\u3001\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u5206\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u672c\u8d28\u662f\u7c7b\u95f4\u5747\u503c\u504f\u79fb\uff1b\u8be5\u4fe1\u53f7\u672a\u88ab\u8f93\u51fa\u5c42\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u679c\u5dee\uff1b\u68c0\u6d4b\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u51e0\u4f55\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u590d\u6742\u5b66\u4e60\u3002"}}

This raises a fundamental question: which models should be selected when forming an LLM ensemble? We formulate budgeted ensemble selection as maximizing the mutual information between the true label and predictions of the selected models. Furthermore, to explain why performance can saturate even with many models, we model the correlated errors of the models using Gaussian-copula and show an information-theoretic error floor for the performance of the ensemble. Motivated by these, we propose a simple greedy mutual-information selection algorithm that estimates the required information terms directly from data and iteratively builds an ensemble under a query budget. We test our approach in two question answering datasets and one binary sentiment classification dataset: MEDMCQA, MMLU, and IMDB movie reviews.

However, standard approaches typically rely on activation addition, a geometric operation that inevitably alters the magnitude of hidden representations. This raises concerns about representation collapse and degradation of open-ended generation capabilities. In this work, we explore Spherical Steering, a training-free primitive that resolves this trade-off through activation rotation. Rather than shifting activations with a fixed vector, our method rotates them along a geodesic toward a target direction, guiding the activation toward the target concept while preserving the integrity of the signal. To further enhance adaptivity, we incorporate a confidence gate that dynamically modulates steering strength based on input uncertainty. Extensive experiments across multiple-choice benchmarks demonstrate that Spherical Steering significantly outperforms addition-based baselines (notably by +10% on TruthfulQA, COPA, and Storycloze), while simultaneously maintaining the model's general open-ended generation quality.

Cameras provide dense visual cues but ill posed depth; LiDAR provides a precise 3D structure but sparse coverage. Existing BEV-based fusion frameworks have made good progress, but they have difficulties including inefficient context modeling, spatially invariant fusion, and reasoning under uncertainty. We introduce MambaFusion, a unified multi-modal detection framework that achieves efficient, adaptive, and physically grounded 3D perception. MambaFusion interleaves selective state-space models (SSMs) with windowed transformers to propagate the global context in linear time while preserving local geometric fidelity. A multi-modal token alignment (MTA) module and reliability-aware fusion gates dynamically re-weight camera-LiDAR features based on spatial confidence and calibration consistency. Finally, a structure-conditioned diffusion head integrates graph-based reasoning with uncertainty-aware denoising, enforcing physical plausibility, and calibrated confidence. MambaFusion establishes new state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes benchmarks while operating with linear-time complexity. The framework demonstrates that coupling SSM-based efficiency with reliability-driven fusion yields robust, temporally stable, and interpretable 3D perception for real-world autonomous driving systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "MambaFusion\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u60013D\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff08SSM\uff09\u4e0e\u7a97\u53e3\u5316Transformer\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ee4\u724c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08MTA\uff09\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u878d\u5408\u95e8\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e14\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684BEV\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u5728nuScenes\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eBEV\u7684\u76f8\u673a-LiDAR\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\u4f4e\u6548\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u878d\u5408\u4e0d\u53d8\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5f31\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMambaFusion\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u4ea4\u66ff\u5806\u53e0SSM\u4e0e\u7a97\u53e3Transformer\u4ee5\u7ebf\u6027\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4f20\u64ad\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u5c40\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u4fdd\u771f\uff1b2\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ee4\u724c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08MTA\uff09\u6a21\u5757\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u878d\u5408\u95e8\uff0c\u4f9d\u636e\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6807\u5b9a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u52a0\u6743\u7279\u5f81\uff1b3\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6269\u6563\u68c0\u6d4b\u5934\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u56fe\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u53bb\u566a\uff0c\u4fdd\u969c\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728nuScenes\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u65b0SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff1b\u5177\u5907\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06SSM\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u53ef\u6784\u5efa\u9762\u5411\u771f\u5b9e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u76843D\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Orthogonally, projection-based low-rank optimizers were mainly designed for memory efficiency, but remain suboptimal for communication-limited training: one-sided synchronization still transmits an $O(rn)$ object for an $m\\times n$ matrix gradient and refresh steps can dominate peak communicated bytes. We propose TSR, which brings two-sided low-rank communication to Adam-family updates (TSR-Adam) by synchronizing a compact core $U^\\top G V\\in\\mathbb{R}^{r\\times r}$, reducing the dominant per-step payload from $O(mn)$ to $O(r^2)$ while keeping moment states in low-dimensional cores. To further reduce the peak communication from subspace refresh, TSR-Adam adopts a randomized SVD-based refresh that avoids full-gradient synchronization. We additionally extend low-rank communication to embedding gradients with embedding-specific ranks and refresh schedules, yielding additional communication and memory savings over keeping embeddings dense. Across pretraining from 60M to 1B model scales, TSR-Adam reduces average communicated bytes per step by $13\\times$, and on GLUE fine-tuning it reduces communication by $25\\times$, while achieving comparable performance; we further provide a theoretical stationarity analysis for the proposed update.

Project page: https://konstantinosmitsides.github.io/dreaming-in-code", "summary": "Open-ended learning frames intelligence as emerging from continual interaction with an ever-expanding space of environments. While recent advances have utilized foundation models to programmatically generate diverse environments, these approaches often focus on discovering isolated behaviors rather than orchestrating sustained progression. In complex open-ended worlds, the large combinatorial space of possible challenges makes it difficult for agents to discover sequences of experiences that remain consistently learnable. To address this, we propose Dreaming in Code (DiCode), a framework in which foundation models synthesize executable environment code to scaffold learning toward increasing competence. In DiCode, \"dreaming\" takes the form of materializing code-level variations of the world. We instantiate DiCode in Craftax, a challenging open-ended benchmark characterized by rich mechanics and long-horizon progression. Empirically, DiCode enables agents to acquire long-horizon skills, achieving a $16\\%$ improvement in mean return over the strongest baseline and non-zero success on late-game combat tasks where prior methods fail. Our results suggest that code-level environment design provides a practical mechanism for curriculum control, enabling the construction of intermediate environments that bridge competence gaps in open-ended worlds.

Our formulation renders possible to express a rich family of operators over generative models densities, including intersection (e.g., to enforce safety), union (e.g., to compose diverse models), interpolation (e.g., for discovery), their reward-guided counterparts, as well as complex logical expressions via generative circuits. Next, we introduce Reward-Guided Flow Merging (RFM), a mirror-descent scheme that reduces reward-guided flow merging to a sequence of standard fine-tuning problems. Then, we provide first-of-their-kind theoretical guarantees for reward-guided and pure flow merging via RFM.

The rapid development of intelligent tools, especially large language models (LLMs) with powerful knowledge reserves and interactive capabilities, has provided new paradigms for it. Nevertheless, the intrinsic challenge for LLMs lies in the complex implicit relationship between molecular structure and pharmacological properties and the lack of corresponding labeled data. To bridge this gap, we propose DrugR, an LLM-based method that introduces explicit, step-by-step pharmacological reasoning into the optimization process. Our approach integrates domain-specific continual pretraining, supervised fine-tuning via reverse data engineering, and self-balanced multi-granular reinforcement learning. This framework enables DrugR to effectively improve key ADMET properties while preserving the original molecule's core efficacy. Experimental results demonstrate that DrugR achieves comprehensive enhancement across multiple properties without compromising structural similarity or target binding affinity.

Recent work proposed several visual jailbreak attacks using single/ holistic images. However, contemporary VLMs demonstrate strong robustness against such attacks due to extensive safety alignment through preference optimization (e.g., RLHF). In this work, we identify a new vulnerability: while VLM pretraining and instruction tuning generalize well to split-image inputs, safety alignment is typically performed only on holistic images and does not account for harmful semantics distributed across multiple image fragments. Consequently, VLMs often fail to detect and refuse harmful split-image inputs, where unsafe cues emerge only after combining images. We introduce novel split-image visual jailbreak attacks (SIVA) that exploit this misalignment. Unlike prior optimization-based attacks, which exhibit poor black-box transferability due to architectural and prior mismatches across models, our attacks evolve in progressive phases from naive splitting to an adaptive white-box attack, culminating in a black-box transfer attack.

As an important branch of large language model(LLM), MoE model only activate a subset of experts based on a routing network. This sparse conditional computation mechanism significantly improves computational efficiency, paving a promising path for greater scalability and cost-efficiency. It not only enhance downstream applications such as natural language processing, computer vision, and multimodal in various horizontal domains, but also exhibit broad applicability across vertical domains. Despite the growing popularity and application of MoE models across various domains, there lacks a systematic exploration of recent advancements of MoE in many important fields. Existing surveys on MoE suffer from limitations such as lack coverage or none extensively exploration of key areas. This survey seeks to fill these gaps. In this paper, Firstly, we examine the foundational principles of MoE, with an in-depth exploration of its core components-the routing network and expert network. Subsequently, we extend beyond the centralized paradigm to the decentralized paradigm, which unlocks the immense untapped potential of decentralized infrastructure, enables democratization of MoE development for broader communities, and delivers greater scalability and cost-efficiency. Furthermore we focus on exploring its vertical domain applications. Finally, we also identify key challenges and promising future research directions.

Project page: https://adaptive-visual-tts.github.io/", "summary": "Despite rapid progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), visual spatial reasoning remains unreliable when correct answers depend on how a scene would appear under unseen or alternative viewpoints. Recent work addresses this by augmenting reasoning with world models for visual imagination, but questions such as when imagination is actually necessary, how much of it is beneficial, and when it becomes harmful, remain poorly understood. In practice, indiscriminate imagination can increase computation and even degrade performance by introducing misleading evidence. In this work, we present an in-depth analysis of test-time visual imagination as a controllable resource for spatial reasoning. We study when static visual evidence is sufficient, when imagination improves reasoning, and how excessive or unnecessary imagination affects accuracy and efficiency. To support this analysis, we introduce AVIC, an adaptive test-time framework with world models that explicitly reasons about the sufficiency of current visual evidence before selectively invoking and scaling visual imagination. Across spatial reasoning benchmarks (SAT, MMSI) and an embodied navigation benchmark (R2R), our results reveal clear scenarios where imagination is critical, marginal, or detrimental, and show that selective control can match or outperform fixed imagination strategies with substantially fewer world-model calls and language tokens. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of analyzing and controlling test-time imagination for efficient and reliable spatial reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAVIC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u89c6\u89c9\u60f3\u8c61\u7684\u8c03\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MLLMs\u5728\u4f9d\u8d56\u672a\u89c1\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff1b\u76f2\u76ee\u4f7f\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u60f3\u8c61\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAVIC\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u5f0f\u5224\u65ad\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\u662f\u5426\u5145\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8c03\u7528\u548c\u7f29\u653e\u89c6\u89c9\u60f3\u8c61\u3002", "result": "\u5728SAT\u3001MMSI\u548cR2R\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u60f3\u8c61\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff08\u5173\u952e/\u8fb9\u7f18/\u6709\u5bb3\uff09\uff0cAVIC\u4ee5\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u8c03\u7528\u548c\u8bed\u8a00token\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u56fa\u5b9a\u60f3\u8c61\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u89c6\u89c9\u60f3\u8c61\u5e94\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u63a7\u8d44\u6e90\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u8c03\u63a7\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose DAS-SK, a novel lightweight architecture that retrofits selective kernel convolution (SK-Conv) into the dual atrous separable convolution (DAS-Conv) module to strengthen multi-scale feature learning. The model further enhances the atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) module, enabling the capture of fine-grained local structures alongside global contextual information. Built upon a modified DeepLabV3 framework with two complementary backbones - MobileNetV3-Large and EfficientNet-B3, the DAS-SK model mitigates limitations associated with large dataset requirements, limited spectral generalization, and the high computational cost that typically restricts deployment on UAVs and other edge devices. Comprehensive experiments across three benchmarks: LandCover.ai, VDD, and PhenoBench, demonstrate that DAS-SK consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, while being more efficient than CNN-, transformer-, and hybrid-based competitors. Notably, DAS-SK requires up to 21x fewer parameters and 19x fewer GFLOPs than top-performing transformer models.

First, on multi-key retrieval, ManifoldKV reduces directional collisions, achieving 92.4% vs KeyDiff's 77.0% (+15.4 points) on 3-key NIAH at 50% compression. Second, to address dilution and performance collapse of global centroids at 64K context, we introduce WindowedManifoldKV, which restores accuracy to 84.3% at 25% compression, a 49-point recovery over global L2 and +3.2 points over KeyDiff.

Current methods either require heavyweight models at inference or rely on highly sequential imagination, both of which impose prohibitive computational costs. We propose Horizon Imagination (HI), an on-policy imagination process for discrete stochastic policies that denoises multiple future observations in parallel. HI incorporates a stabilization mechanism and a novel sampling schedule that decouples the denoising budget from the effective horizon over which denoising is applied while also supporting sub-frame budgets. Experiments on Atari 100K and Craftium show that our approach maintains control performance with a sub-frame budget of half the denoising steps and achieves superior generation quality under varied schedules.

Under peer review", "summary": "Estimating Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) from echocardiograms constitutes an ill-posed inverse problem. Inherent noise, artifacts, and limited viewing angles introduce ambiguity, where a single video sequence may map not to a unique ground truth, but rather to a distribution of plausible physiological values. Prevailing deep learning approaches typically formulate this task as a standard regression problem that minimizes the Mean Squared Error (MSE). However, this paradigm compels the model to learn the conditional expectation, which may yield misleading predictions when the underlying posterior distribution is multimodal or heavy-tailed -- a common phenomenon in pathological scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the paradigm shift from deterministic regression toward generative regression. We propose the Multimodal Conditional Score-based Diffusion model for Regression (MCSDR), a probabilistic framework designed to model the continuous posterior distribution of LVEF conditioned on echocardiogram videos and patient demographic attribute priors. Extensive experiments conducted on the EchoNet-Dynamic, EchoNet-Pediatric, and CAMUS datasets demonstrate that MCSDR achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, qualitative analysis reveals that the generation trajectories of our model exhibit distinct behaviors in cases characterized by high noise or significant physiological variability, thereby offering a novel layer of interpretability for AI-aided diagnosis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u6570\u6269\u6563\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff08MCSDR\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u8d85\u58f0\u5fc3\u52a8\u56fe\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u4f30\u8ba1\u5de6\u5fc3\u5ba4\u5c04\u8840\u5206\u6570\uff08LVEF\uff09\uff0c\u5efa\u6a21\u5176\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u800c\u975e\u5355\u4e00\u786e\u5b9a\u503c\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u75c5\u7406\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8eMSE\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9LVEF\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u91cd\u5c3e\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u5927\u6216\u75c5\u7406\u53d8\u5f02\u5927\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMultimodal Conditional Score-based Diffusion model for Regression\uff08MCSDR\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u56de\u5f52\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5206\u6570\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5efa\u6a21LVEF\u5728\u8d85\u58f0\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u60a3\u8005\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5148\u9a8c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5728EchoNet-Dynamic\u3001EchoNet-Pediatric\u548cCAMUS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u5176\u91c7\u6837\u8f68\u8ff9\u80fd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53cd\u6620\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u9ad8\u751f\u7406\u53d8\u5f02\u60c5\u5f62\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u56de\u5f52\u8303\u5f0f\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u66f4\u9002\u4e8e\u5efa\u6a21\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5185\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u751f\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u8f85\u52a9\u8bca\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

We prove that the MAP estimator of SCoRa is well-behaved. It verifies monotonicity and robustness guarantees. We then empirically show that SCoRa recovers accurate scores, even under model mismatch.

This framework advances upon prior methods, such as BSAFE, by primarily leveraging a Reinforcement Learning (RL) stage where models learn to dynamically correct their own generation errors. Through RL with critic feedback on the model's live outputs, LLMs are trained to identify and recover from their actual, emergent safety violations by emitting an efficient \"backtrack by x tokens\" signal, then continuing generation autoregressively. This RL process is crucial for instilling resilience against sophisticated adversarial strategies, including middle filling, Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) attacks, and decoding parameter manipulations. To further support the acquisition of this backtracking capability, we also propose an enhanced Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) data generation strategy (BSAFE+). This method improves upon previous data creation techniques by injecting violations into coherent, originally safe text, providing more effective initial training for the backtracking mechanism.

However, existing methods predominantly rely on the passive mapping of visual features and textual embeddings. This ``appearance-based\" paradigm lacks geospatial contextual awareness, leading to severe semantic ambiguity and misclassification when encountering land-cover classes with similar spectral features but distinct semantic attributes. To address this, we propose a Geospatial Reasoning Chain-of-Thought (GR-CoT) framework designed to enhance the scene understanding capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), thereby guiding open-vocabulary segmentation models toward precise mapping. The framework comprises two collaborative components: an offline knowledge distillation stream and an online instance reasoning stream. The offline stream establishes fine-grained category interpretation standards to resolve semantic conflicts between similar land-cover types. During online inference, the framework executes a sequential reasoning process involving macro-scenario anchoring, visual feature decoupling, and knowledge-driven decision synthesis. This process generates an image-adaptive vocabulary that guides downstream models to achieve pixel-level alignment with correct geographical semantics.

However, current methods often depend on replay-based strategies, which raise concerns like memory limits and privacy issues, while also struggling to resolve the stability-plasticity dilemma. In this paper, we suggest that lightweight, task-specific modules can effectively guide the reasoning process of a fixed GNN backbone. Based on this idea, we propose Task-Aware Adaptive Modulation (TAAM). The key component of TAAM is its lightweight Neural Synapse Modulators (NSMs). For each new task, a dedicated NSM is trained and then frozen, acting as an \"expert module.\" These modules perform detailed, node-attentive adaptive modulation on the computational flow of a shared GNN backbone. This setup ensures that new knowledge is kept within compact, task-specific modules, naturally preventing catastrophic forgetting without using any data replay. Additionally, to address the important challenge of unknown task IDs in real-world scenarios, we propose and theoretically prove a novel method named Anchored Multi-hop Propagation (AMP). Notably, we find that existing GCL benchmarks have flaws that can cause data leakage and biased evaluations. Therefore, we conduct all experiments in a more rigorous inductive learning scenario.

We adopt a simple philosophical view, robust reasoning should remain useful beyond the mind that produced it, and treat reasoning as a form of meaning transfer that must survive truncation, reinterpretation, and continuation. Building on this principle, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Transferable Reward (RLTR), which operationalizes robustness via transfer reward that tests whether a partial reasoning prefix from one model can guide a separate model to the correct answer. This encourages LLMs to produce reasoning that is stable, interpretable, and genuinely generalizable. Our approach improves sampling consistency while improving final answer accuracy, and it reaches comparable performance in substantially fewer training steps.

In this paper, we analyse the effect of various techniques for providing additional visual and textual context via tool use to the MLLM and its effect on the REC task. Furthermore, we propose a training-free framework named Chain-of-Caption to improve the REC performance of MLLMs. We perform experiments on RefCOCO/RefCOCOg/RefCOCO+ and Ref-L4 datasets and show that individual textual or visual context can improve the REC performance without any fine-tuning.

Standard reinitialization methods, which reinitialize weights toward their original values, are widely used but difficult to tune: conservative reinitializations fail to restore plasticity, while aggressive ones erase useful knowledge. We propose FIRE, a principled reinitialization method that explicitly balances the stability-plasticity tradeoff. FIRE quantifies stability through Squared Frobenius Error (SFE), measuring proximity to past weights, and plasticity through Deviation from Isometry (DfI), reflecting weight isotropy. The reinitialization point is obtained by solving a constrained optimization problem, minimizing SFE subject to DfI being zero, which is efficiently approximated by Newton-Schulz iteration. FIRE is evaluated on continual visual learning (CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18), language modeling (OpenWebText with GPT-0.1B), and reinforcement learning (HumanoidBench with SAC and Atari games with DQN).

To address this challenge, we propose correction-specific rollouts (Octopus), an RL rollout augmentation framework that synthesizes dense self-correction examples by recombining existing rollouts. This augmentation simultaneously improves sample efficiency due to rollout reuse and stabilizes RL optimization through balanced supervision.

In this paper, we observe that SAM2 exhibits sparse perception pattern as biological vision, which provides opportunities for eliminating redundant computation and acceleration: i) In mask decoder, the attention primarily focuses on the foreground objects, whereas the image encoder in the earlier stage exhibits a broad attention span, which results in unnecessary computation to background regions. ii) In memory bank, only a small subset of tokens in each frame contribute significantly to memory attention, and the salient regions exhibit temporal consistency, making full-token computation redundant. With these insights, we propose Efficient-SAM2, which promotes SAM2 to adaptively focus on object regions while eliminating task-irrelevant computations, thereby significantly improving inference efficiency. Specifically, for image encoder, we propose object-aware Sparse Window Routing (SWR), a window-level computation allocation mechanism that leverages the consistency and saliency cues from the previous-frame decoder to route background regions into a lightweight shortcut branch. Moreover, for memory attention, we propose object-aware Sparse Memory Retrieval (SMR), which allows only the salient memory tokens in each frame to participate in computation, with the saliency pattern reused from their first recollection. With negligible additional parameters and minimal training overhead, Efficient-SAM2 delivers 1.68x speedup on SAM2.1-L model with only 1.0% accuracy drop on SA-V test set.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faEfficient-SAM2\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8c61\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5236\uff08SWR\u548cSMR\uff09\u63d0\u5347SAM2\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u4ec5\u635f\u59311.0%\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b01.68\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "SAM2\u867d\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a0\u901f\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\uff1b\u4f5c\u8005\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230SAM2\u5b58\u5728\u7c7b\u751f\u7269\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u53ef\u636e\u6b64\u524a\u51cf\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEfficient-SAM2\uff1a1\uff09\u9762\u5411\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u611f\u77e5\u7a00\u758f\u7a97\u53e3\u8def\u7531\uff08SWR\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u524d\u5e27\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6027\u4e0e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5c06\u80cc\u666f\u533a\u57df\u8def\u7531\u81f3\u8f7b\u91cf\u5feb\u6377\u5206\u652f\uff1b2\uff09\u9762\u5411\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u611f\u77e5\u7a00\u758f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u68c0\u7d22\uff08SMR\uff09\uff0c\u4ec5\u4fdd\u7559\u6bcf\u5e27\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u8bb0\u5fc6token\u53c2\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5e76\u590d\u7528\u5176\u9996\u6b21\u88ab\u53ec\u56de\u65f6\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728SAM2.1-L\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b01.68\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0cSA-V\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4ec5\u4e0b\u964d1.0%\uff0c\u4e14\u5f15\u5165\u53c2\u6570\u6781\u5c11\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f00\u9500\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528SAM2\u5185\u5728\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u611f\u77e5\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7SWR\u548cSMR\u4e24\u79cd\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u5272\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

A pressing challenge arises from the vulnerability of deep neural networks to adversarial examples, which poses a significant threat to the reliability of event-based systems. Nevertheless, research into adversarial attacks on events is scarce. This is primarily due to the non-differentiable nature of mainstream event representations, which hinders the extension of gradient-based attack methods. In this paper, we propose MA-ADV, a novel \\textbf{M}otion-\\textbf{A}ware \\textbf{Adv}ersarial framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to generate adversarial events by leveraging point cloud representations. MA-ADV accounts for high-frequency noise in events and employs a diffusion-based approach to smooth perturbations, while fully leveraging the spatial and temporal relationships among events. Finally, MA-ADV identifies the minimal-cost perturbation through a combination of sample-wise Adam optimization, iterative refinement, and binary search. Extensive experimental results validate that MA-ADV ensures a 100\\% attack success rate with minimal perturbation cost, and also demonstrate enhanced robustness against defenses, underscoring the critical security challenges facing future event-based perception systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u70b9\u4e91\u8868\u793a\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u5bf9\u6297\u6846\u67b6MA-ADV\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u6ed1\u6270\u52a8\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408Adam\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u8fed\u4ee3\u7cbe\u70bc\u4e0e\u4e8c\u5206\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0100%\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u5f3a\u9632\u5fa1\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7b49\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6613\u53d7\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u653b\u51fb\uff1b\u800c\u4e3b\u6d41\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8868\u5f81\u4e0d\u53ef\u5fae\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u68af\u5ea6\u7c7b\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u5341\u5206\u532e\u4e4f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMA-ADV\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u70b9\u4e91\u8868\u793a\u5efa\u6a21\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u6269\u6563\u673a\u5236\u5e73\u6ed1\u9ad8\u9891\u566a\u58f0\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4-\u65f6\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6837\u672c\u7ea7Adam\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u8fed\u4ee3\u7cbe\u70bc\u4e0e\u4e8c\u5206\u641c\u7d22\u8054\u5408\u6c42\u89e3\u6700\u5c0f\u4ee3\u4ef7\u6270\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86100%\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u6270\u52a8\u4ee3\u4ef7\u6700\u5c0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u66f4\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MA-ADV\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e8b\u4ef6\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u4e25\u5cfb\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u548c\u9996\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

However, existing threshold determination methods face critical challenges: analytical bounds are overly conservative, while probabilistic approaches like A-ABFT yield thresholds $160$--$4200\\times$ larger than actual rounding errors. We present V-ABFT, a variance-based adaptive threshold algorithm that achieves tighter error bounds by directly modeling the verification difference. By leveraging statistical variance estimation, V-ABFT reduces the threshold-to-actual-error ratio to approximately $7$--$20\\times$ for FP32/FP64 and $48$--$158\\times$ for BF16, representing a \\textbf{6--48$\\times$ improvement} over A-ABFT while maintaining zero false positive rate across BF16, FP16, FP32, and FP64 precisions.

However, most existing methods rely on functional connectivity (FC) via Pearson correlation, which reduces 4D BOLD signals to static 2D matrices, discarding temporal dynamics and capturing only linear inter-regional relationships. In this work, we benchmark state-of-the-art temporal models (e.g., time-series models such as PatchTST, TimesNet, and TimeMixer) on raw BOLD signals across five public datasets. Results show these models consistently outperform traditional FC-based approaches, highlighting the value of directly modeling temporal information such as cycle-like oscillatory fluctuations and drift-like slow baseline trends. Building on this insight, we propose DeCI, a simple yet effective framework that integrates two key principles: (i) Cycle and Drift Decomposition to disentangle cycle and drift within each ROI (Region of Interest); and (ii) Channel-Independence to model each ROI separately, improving robustness and reducing overfitting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeCI achieves superior classification accuracy and generalization compared to both FC-based and temporal baselines. Our findings advocate for a shift toward end-to-end temporal modeling in fMRI analysis to better capture complex brain dynamics.

To address this, we propose Epigraph-Guided Flow Matching (EpiFlow), a framework that formulates safe offline RL as a state-constrained optimal control problem to co-optimize safety and performance. We learn a feasibility value function derived from an epigraph reformulation of the optimal control problem, thereby avoiding the decoupled objectives or post-hoc filtering common in prior work. Policies are synthesized by reweighting the behavior distribution based on this epigraph value function and fitting a generative policy via flow matching, enabling efficient, distribution-consistent sampling.

As RL is increasingly applied to settings such as verifiable rewards and multi-objective alignment, RMs are expected to encode more complex and multifaceted preference distributions. However, classifier RMs remain static once trained, limiting their adaptability at test time. We propose Variational In-Context Reward Modeling (ICRM), a novel Bayesian reward modeling objective that enables test-time steerability via in-context preference demonstrations. ICRM casts reward modeling as amortized variational inference over a latent preference probability under the Bradley-Terry model using a conjugate Beta prior. We show that ICRM adapt to unseen preference distributions at test time for both single and multi-objective settings. With more in-context demonstrations, ICRM gains 34% accuracy on SafeRLHF and 9% accuracy on RM-Bench in the single-objective setting, while widening the Pareto frontier with a 4% gain in hypervolume on helpfulness and refusal benchmarks.

In professional AI-assisted filmmaking, it is crucial to perform precise, targeted modifications. A cornerstone of this transition is video instance insertion, which requires inserting a specific instance into existing footage while maintaining scene integrity. Unlike traditional video editing, this task demands several requirements: precise spatial-temporal placement, physically consistent scene interaction, and the faithful preservation of original dynamics - all achieved under minimal user effort. In this paper, we propose PISCO, a video diffusion model for precise video instance insertion with arbitrary sparse keyframe control. PISCO allows users to specify a single keyframe, start-and-end keyframes, or sparse keyframes at arbitrary timestamps, and automatically propagates object appearance, motion, and interaction. To address the severe distribution shift induced by sparse conditioning in pretrained video diffusion models, we introduce Variable-Information Guidance for robust conditioning and Distribution-Preserving Temporal Masking to stabilize temporal generation, together with geometry-aware conditioning for realistic scene adaptation. We further construct PISCO-Bench, a benchmark with verified instance annotations and paired clean background videos, and evaluate performance using both reference-based and reference-free perceptual metrics. Experiments demonstrate that PISCO consistently outperforms strong inpainting and video editing baselines under sparse control, and exhibits clear, monotonic performance improvements as additional control signals are provided.

Among many approaches to mitigate the inefficiencies of sequential token-by-token generation, Speculative Decoding (SD) has emerged as a promising technique. However, SD at the edge is hindered by two major challenges: (1) integrating SD into a compiler-based workflow without sacrificing performance or programmability, and (2) exploiting the heterogeneous compute resources of modern SoCs through carefully designed partitioning strategies. This work addresses these challenges by using an analytical cost model that explores heterogeneous hardware configurations and guides coarse-grained partitioning of LLM subgraphs, particularly with edge-typical short input sequence lengths.

These findings have enabled improved understanding of the expressive capacity and generalization abilities of Transformers. In particular, Transformers have been suggested to length-generalize exactly on problems that have simple RASP programs. However, it remains open whether trained models actually implement simple interpretable programs. In this paper, we present a general method to extract such programs from trained Transformers. The idea is to faithfully re-parameterize a Transformer as a RASP program and then apply causal interventions to discover a small sufficient sub-program. In experiments on small Transformers trained on algorithmic and formal language tasks, we show that our method often recovers simple and interpretable RASP programs from length-generalizing transformers.

Presence-Absence (PA) data provide accurate and noise-free labels, but are costly to obtain and limited in quantity; Presence-Only (PO) data, by contrast, offer broad spatial coverage and rich spatiotemporal distribution, but suffer from severe label noise in negative samples. To address these real-world constraints, this paper proposes a multimodal fusion framework that fully leverages the strengths of both PA and PO data. We introduce an innovative pseudo-label aggregation strategy for PO data based on the geographic coverage of satellite imagery, enabling geographic alignment between the label space and remote sensing feature space. In terms of model architecture, we adopt Swin Transformer Base as the backbone for satellite imagery, utilize the TabM network for tabular feature extraction, retain the Temporal Swin Transformer for time-series modeling, and employ a stackable serial tri-modal cross-attention mechanism to optimize the fusion of heterogeneous modalities. Furthermore, empirical analysis reveals significant geographic distribution shifts between PA training and test samples, and models trained by directly mixing PO and PA data tend to experience performance degradation due to label noise in PO data. To address this, we draw on the mixture-of-experts paradigm: test samples are partitioned according to their spatial proximity to PA samples, and different models trained on distinct datasets are used for inference and post-processing within each partition. Experiments on the GeoLifeCLEF 2025 dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves superior predictive performance in scenarios with limited PA coverage and pronounced distribution shifts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Presence-Absence\uff08PA\uff09\u548cPresence-Only\uff08PO\uff09\u690d\u7269\u5206\u5e03\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5730\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u805a\u5408\u3001\u4e09\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a7a\u95f4\u90bb\u8fd1\u6027\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8de8\u7269\u79cd\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u690d\u7269\u5206\u5e03\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728PA\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u5730\u7406\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u690d\u7269\u5206\u5e03\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2dPA\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u6602\u8d35\u3001PO\u6570\u636e\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5e94\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3001\u504f\u5dee\u6027\u53ca\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d4b\u8bd5\u95f4\u5730\u7406\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u536b\u661f\u5f71\u50cf\u5730\u7406\u8986\u76d6\u7684PO\u6570\u636e\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff1b2\uff09\u91c7\u7528Swin Transformer Base\uff08\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\u3001TabM\uff08\u8868\u683c\u7279\u5f81\uff09\u3001Temporal Swin Transformer\uff08\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5404\u6a21\u6001\u9aa8\u5e72\uff1b3\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u5806\u53e0\u7684\u4e32\u884c\u4e09\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff1b4\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8ePA\u6837\u672c\u7a7a\u95f4\u90bb\u8fd1\u6027\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5206\u533a\u8c03\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728GeoLifeCLEF 2025\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728PA\u8986\u76d6\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u663e\u8457\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u878d\u5408PA\u4e0ePO\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u8f85\u4ee5\u5730\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u534f\u540c\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8de8\u7269\u79cd\u690d\u7269\u5206\u5e03\u9884\u6d4b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, these systems remain susceptible to malicious prompts that induce unsafe or policy-violating behavior through harmful requests, jailbreak techniques, and prompt injection attacks. Existing defenses face fundamental limitations: black-box moderation APIs offer limited transparency and adapt poorly to evolving threats, while white-box approaches using large LLM judges impose prohibitive computational costs and require expensive retraining for new attacks. Current systems force designers to choose between performance, efficiency, and adaptability.\n  To address these challenges, we present BAGEL (Bootstrap AGgregated Ensemble Layer), a modular, lightweight, and incrementally updatable framework for malicious prompt detection. BAGEL employs a bootstrap aggregation and mixture of expert inspired ensemble of fine-tuned models, each specialized on a different attack dataset. At inference, BAGEL uses a random forest router to identify the most suitable ensemble member, then applies stochastic selection to sample additional members for prediction aggregation. When new attacks emerge, BAGEL updates incrementally by fine-tuning a small prompt-safety classifier (86M parameters) and adding the resulting model to the ensemble. BAGEL achieves an F1 score of 0.92 by selecting just 5 ensemble members (430M parameters), outperforming OpenAI Moderation API and ShieldGemma which require billions of parameters. Performance remains robust after nine incremental updates, and BAGEL provides interpretability through its router's structural features. Our results show ensembles of small finetuned classifiers can match or exceed billion-parameter guardrails while offering the adaptability and efficiency required for production systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faBAGEL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u4e14\u53ef\u589e\u91cf\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u6076\u610f\u63d0\u793a\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u7ec6\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u8def\u7531\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u6210\u5458\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u5927\u578bAPI\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u4f4e\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5dee\u6216\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "method": "BAGEL\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u4e3e\u805a\u5408\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u96c6\u6210\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u653b\u51fb\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\uff1b\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7531\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u8def\u7531\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u9002\u6210\u5458\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\u805a\u5408\uff1b\u65b0\u589e\u653b\u51fb\u7c7b\u578b\u65f6\u4ec5\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0886M\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u5e76\u52a0\u5165\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "result": "BAGEL\u5728\u4ec5\u9009\u75285\u4e2a\u96c6\u6210\u6210\u5458\uff08\u5171430M\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u65f6\u8fbe\u52300.92 F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eOpenAI Moderation API\u548cShieldGemma\u7b49\u9700\u6570\u5341\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u6848\uff1b\u7ecf9\u6b21\u589e\u91cf\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u6027\u80fd\u4ecd\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u8def\u7531\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u5fae\u8c03\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u53ef\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e09\u65b9\u9762\u8d85\u8d8a\u8d85\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b88\u95e8\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

To address this challenge, we proposed a novel Caption-aligned and Agreement-guided Enhancement framework (CAE-AV) for audio-visual learning, which used two complementary modules: Cross-modal Agreement-guided Spatio-Temporal Enrichment (CASTE) and Caption-Aligned Saliency-guided Enrichment (CASE) to relieve audio-visual misalignment. CASTE dynamically balances spatial and temporal relations by evaluating frame-level audio-visual agreement, ensuring that key information is captured from both preceding and subsequent frames under misalignment.

Consequently, learning an unknown distribution with non-asymptotic and easy-to-compute error bounds in Wasserstein distance has become a fundamental problem in many fields. In this paper, we devise a novel algorithmic and theoretical framework to approximate an unknown probability distribution $\\mathbb{P}$ from a finite set of samples by an approximate discrete distribution $\\widehat{\\mathbb{P}}$ while bounding the Wasserstein distance between $\\mathbb{P}$ and $\\widehat{\\mathbb{P}}$. Our framework leverages optimal transport, nonlinear optimization, and concentration inequalities. In particular, we show that, even if $\\mathbb{P}$ is unknown, the Wasserstein distance between $\\mathbb{P}$ and $\\widehat{\\mathbb{P}}$ can be efficiently bounded with high confidence by solving a tractable optimization problem (a mixed integer linear program) of a size that only depends on the size of the support of $\\widehat{\\mathbb{P}}$. This enables us to develop intelligent clustering algorithms to optimally find the support of $\\widehat{\\mathbb{P}}$ while minimizing the Wasserstein distance error.

We propose a framework for evaluating goal-directedness that integrates behavioural evaluation with interpretability-based analyses of models' internal representations. As a case study, we examine an LLM agent navigating a 2D grid world toward a goal state. Behaviourally, we evaluate the agent against an optimal policy across varying grid sizes, obstacle densities, and goal structures, finding that performance scales with task difficulty while remaining robust to difficulty-preserving transformations and complex goal structures. We then use probing methods to decode the agent's internal representations of the environment state and its multi-step action plans. We find that the LLM agent non-linearly encodes a coarse spatial map of the environment, preserving approximate task-relevant cues about its position and the goal location; that its actions are broadly consistent with these internal representations; and that reasoning reorganises them, shifting from broader environment structural cues toward information supporting immediate action selection.

In this paradigm, increasing the number of tokens is a common approach to improving motion reconstruction quality, but more tokens make it more difficult for generative models to learn. To maintain high reconstruction quality while reducing generation complexity, we propose leveraging language to achieve efficient motion tokenization, which we term Language-Guided Tokenization (LG-Tok). LG-Tok aligns natural language with motion at the tokenization stage, yielding compact, high-level semantic representations. This approach not only strengthens both tokenization and detokenization but also simplifies the learning of generative models. Furthermore, existing tokenizers predominantly adopt convolutional architectures, whose local receptive fields struggle to support global language guidance. To this end, we propose a Transformer-based Tokenizer that leverages attention mechanisms to enable effective alignment between language and motion. Additionally, we design a language-drop scheme, in which language conditions are randomly removed during training, enabling the detokenizer to support language-free guidance during generation.

Existing bandit-based methods treat time merely as a timestamp, neglecting its explicit relationship with user preferences and leading to suboptimal performance. Moreover, online learning methods often suffer from inefficient exploration-exploitation during the early online phase. To address these issues, we propose HyperBandit+, a novel contextual bandit policy that integrates a time-aware hypernetwork to adapt to time-varying user preferences and employs a large language model-assisted warm-start mechanism (LLM Start) to enhance exploration-exploitation efficiency in the early online phase. Specifically, HyperBandit+ leverages a neural network that takes time features as input and generates parameters for estimating time-varying rewards by capturing the correlation between time and user preferences. Additionally, the LLM Start mechanism employs multi-step data augmentation to simulate realistic interaction data for effective offline learning, providing warm-start parameters for the bandit policy in the early online phase. To meet real-time streaming recommendation demands, we adopt low-rank factorization to reduce hypernetwork training complexity. Theoretically, we rigorously establish a sublinear regret upper bound that accounts for both the hypernetwork and the LLM warm-start mechanism. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that HyperBandit+ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accumulated rewards.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faHyperBandit+\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u8d85\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f85\u52a9\u70ed\u542f\u52a8\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8d4c\u535a\u673a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u6d41\u5f0f\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u53ca\u65e9\u671f\u5728\u7ebf\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u63a2\u7d22-\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d4c\u535a\u673a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u65e9\u671f\u63a2\u7d22-\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHyperBandit+\uff1a1\uff09\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u8d85\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4ee5\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u53d8\u5956\u52b1\u4f30\u8ba1\u53c2\u6570\uff1b2\uff09LLM Start\u70ed\u542f\u52a8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6b65\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u62df\u4ea4\u4e92\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u79bb\u7ebf\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b3\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\u964d\u4f4e\u8d85\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff1b4\uff09\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u7ed9\u51fa\u542b\u8d85\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0eLLM\u70ed\u542f\u52a8\u7684\u4e9a\u7ebf\u6027\u9057\u61be\u4e0a\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cHyperBandit+\u5728\u7d2f\u79ef\u5956\u52b1\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "HyperBandit+\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u70ed\u542f\u52a8\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u65e9\u671f\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0a\u5747\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

Building upon these developments, the thinking with images paradigm has emerged, enabling models to dynamically edit and re-encode visual information at each reasoning step, mirroring human visual processing. However, this paradigm introduces significant challenges as diverse errors may occur during reasoning processes. This necessitates Process Reward Models (PRMs) for distinguishing positive and negative reasoning steps, yet existing benchmarks for PRMs are predominantly text-centric and lack comprehensive assessment under this paradigm. To address these gaps, this work introduces the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for evaluating PRMs under the thinking with images paradigm. Our main contributions are: (1) Through extensive analysis of reasoning trajectories and guided search experiments with PRMs, we define 7 fine-grained error types and demonstrate both the necessity for specialized PRMs and the potential for improvement. (2) We construct a comprehensive benchmark comprising 1,206 manually annotated thinking with images reasoning trajectories spanning 4 categories and 16 subcategories for fine-grained evaluation of PRMs. (3) Our experimental analysis reveals that current LVLMs fall short as effective PRMs, exhibiting limited capabilities in visual reasoning process evaluation with significant performance disparities across error types, positive evaluation bias, and sensitivity to reasoning step positions. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and establish crucial foundations for advancing PRMs in LVLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u2018\u56fe\u50cf\u601d\u8003\u2019\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff08PRMs\uff09\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e867\u79cd\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9519\u8bef\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b1206\u6761\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LVLMs\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3aPRMs\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709PRM\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u4ee5\u6587\u672c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u2018\u56fe\u50cf\u601d\u8003\u2019\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0b\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u800c\u8be5\u8303\u5f0f\u56e0\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u4e0e\u91cd\u7f16\u7801\u6613\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u6837\u5316\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e13\u7528PRM\u53ca\u76f8\u5e94\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f0fPRM\u641c\u7d22\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e497\u7c7b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9519\u8bef\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u8986\u76d64\u5927\u7c7b\u300116\u5b50\u7c7b\u76841206\u6761\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u2018\u56fe\u50cf\u601d\u8003\u2019\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e3b\u6d41LVLMs\u4f5c\u4e3aPRMs\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524dLVLMs\u4f5c\u4e3aPRMs\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff1a\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3001\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u9519\u8bef\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\u3001\u5b58\u5728\u6b63\u5411\u8bc4\u4ef7\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u4e14\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u4f4d\u7f6e\u654f\u611f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6709\u6548\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709LVLMs\u5728PRM\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u9762\u5411LVLMs\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

In Alzheimers disease (AD), multimodal neuroimaging offers complementary signals but VAE-based normative models often (i) fit the healthy reference distribution imperfectly, inflating false positives, and (ii) use posterior aggregation (e.g., PoE/MoE) that can yield weak multimodal fusion in the shared latent space. We propose mmSIVAE, a multimodal soft-introspective variational autoencoder combined with Mixture-of-Product-of-Experts (MOPOE) aggregation to improve reference fidelity and multimodal integration. We compute deviation scores in latent space and feature space as distances from the learned healthy distributions, and map statistically significant latent deviations to regional abnormalities for interpretability. On ADNI MRI regional volumes and amyloid PET SUVR, mmSIVAE improves reconstruction on held-out controls and produces more discriminative deviation scores for outlier detection than VAE baselines, with higher likelihood ratios and clearer separation between control and AD-spectrum cohorts. Deviation maps highlight region-level patterns aligned with established AD-related changes.

Our evaluation reveals that e-commerce content exhibits substantially higher density across visual, audio, and textual modalities compared to mainstream datasets, establishing a more challenging frontier for video understanding. To address this gap, we introduce \\textbf{E-commerce Video Ads Benchmark (E-VAds)}, which is the first benchmark specifically designed for e-commerce short video understanding. We curated 3,961 high-quality videos from Taobao covering a wide range of product categories and used a multi-agent system to generate 19,785 open-ended Q&A pairs. These questions are organized into two primary dimensions, namely Perception and Cognition and Reasoning, which consist of five distinct tasks. Finally, we develop \\textbf{E-VAds-R1}, an RL-based reasoning model featuring a multi-grained reward design called \\textbf{MG-GRPO}. This strategy provides smooth guidance for early exploration while creating a non-linear incentive for expert-level precision.

We propose a training free guardrail based on spectral analysis of attention topology that complements supervised approaches. On Llama 3.1 8B, our method achieves 97.7\\% recall with multi-feature detection and 86.1\\% recall with 81.0\\% precision for balanced deployment, without requiring any labeled training data. Most remarkably, we discover that single layer spectral features act as near-perfect hallucination detectors: Llama L26 Smoothness achieves 98.2\\% recall (213/217 hallucinations caught) with a single threshold, and Mistral L3 Entropy achieves 94.7\\% recall. This suggests hallucination is not merely a wrong token but a thermodynamic state change: the model's attention becomes noise when it errs. Through controlled cross-model evaluation on matched domains ($N=1000$, $T=0.3$, same General domain, hallucination rates 20--22\\%), we reveal the ``Loud Liar'' phenomenon: Llama 3.1 8B's failures are spectrally catastrophic and dramatically easier to detect, while Mistral 7B achieves the best discrimination (AUC 0.900).

However, challenges persist in handling geometric transformations, such as translation, rotation, and scaling, particularly in complex scenes. Existing approaches suffer from two main limitations: (1) difficulty in achieving accurate geometric editing of object translation, rotation, and scaling; (2) inadequate modeling of intricate lighting and shadow effects, leading to unrealistic results. To address these issues, we propose GeoEdit, a framework that leverages in-context generation through a diffusion transformer module, which integrates geometric transformations for precise object edits. Moreover, we introduce Effects-Sensitive Attention, which enhances the modeling of intricate lighting and shadow effects for improved realism. To further support training, we construct RS-Objects, a large-scale geometric editing dataset containing over 120,000 high-quality image pairs, enabling the model to learn precise geometric editing while generating realistic lighting and shadows.

To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{D$^2$-VR}, a single-image diffusion-based video-restoration framework with low-step inference. To obtain precise temporal guidance under severe degradation, we first design a Degradation-Robust Flow Alignment (DRFA) module that leverages confidence-aware attention to filter unreliable motion cues.

In practice, domain knowledge evolves continuously through new regulations, products, services, and interaction patterns. Retraining or fine-tuning LLMs for every new instance is computationally infeasible. Additionally, real-world environments also exhibit temporal dynamics with shifting data distributions. Disregarding this phenomenon, commonly referred to as concept drift, can significantly diminish a model's predictive accuracy. This mismatch between evolving domains and static adaptation pipelines highlights the need for efficient, real-time adaptation without costly retraining. In response, we introduce Online Domain-aware Decoding framework (ODD). ODD performs probability-level fusion between a base LLM and a prefix-tree prior, guided by adaptive confidence modulation using disagreement and continuity signals. Empirical evaluation under diverse drift scenarios demonstrates that ODD consistently surpasses LLM-Greedy and LLM-Temp Scaled across all syntactic and semantic NLG metrics. It yields an absolute ROUGE-L gain of 0.065 and a 13.6% relative improvement in Cosine Similarity over the best baseline.

We cast it as an Information Bottleneck question: what embedding bottleneck dimension is sufficient to compress predictor and predicted views while preserving their mutual information (MI). This repurposes neural MI estimators for dimensionality estimation. We show that standard neural estimators with separable/bilinear critics systematically inflate the inferred dimension, and we address this by introducing a hybrid critic that retains an explicit dimensional bottleneck while allowing flexible nonlinear cross-view interactions, thereby preserving the latent geometry. We further propose a one-shot protocol that reads off the effective dimension from a single over-parameterized hybrid model, without sweeping over bottleneck sizes. We validate the approach on synthetic problems with known task-relevant dimension.

Martin Gillis", "Isaac Xu", "Thomas Trappenberg"], "title": "Variance-Gated Ensembles: An Epistemic-Aware Framework for Uncertainty Estimation", "comment": null, "summary": "Machine learning applications require fast and reliable per-sample uncertainty estimation. A common approach is to use predictive distributions from Bayesian or approximation methods and additively decompose uncertainty into aleatoric (i.e., data-related) and epistemic (i.e., model-related) components. However, additive decomposition has recently been questioned, with evidence that it breaks down when using finite-ensemble sampling and/or mismatched predictive distributions. This paper introduces Variance-Gated Ensembles (VGE), an intuitive, differentiable framework that injects epistemic sensitivity via a signal-to-noise gate computed from ensemble statistics. VGE provides: (i) a Variance-Gated Margin Uncertainty (VGMU) score that couples decision margins with ensemble predictive variance; and (ii) a Variance-Gated Normalization (VGN) layer that generalizes the variance-gated uncertainty mechanism to training via per-class, learnable normalization of ensemble member probabilities. We derive closed-form vector-Jacobian products enabling end-to-end training through ensemble sample mean and variance. VGE matches or exceeds state-of-the-art information-theoretic baselines while remaining computationally efficient.

Existing solutions relying on fixed-size memory or naive compression often suffer from context loss or memory overflow, limiting their effectiveness in long-form, real-time scenarios. We present Vista, a novel framework for scene-aware streaming video QA that enables efficient and scalable reasoning over continuous video streams. The innovation of Vista can be summarized in three aspects: (1) scene-aware segmentation, where Vista dynamically clusters incoming frames into temporally and visually coherent scene units; (2) scene-aware compression, where each scene is compressed into a compact token representation and stored in GPU memory for efficient index-based retrieval, while full-resolution frames are offloaded to CPU memory; and (3) scene-aware recall, where relevant scenes are selectively recalled and reintegrated into the model input upon receiving a query, enabling both efficiency and completeness. Vista is model-agnostic and integrates seamlessly with a variety of vision-language backbones, enabling long-context reasoning without compromising latency or memory efficiency. Extensive experiments on StreamingBench demonstrate that Vista achieves state-of-the-art performance, establishing a strong baseline for real-world streaming video understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Vista\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u573a\u666f\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6d41\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u7b54\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u573a\u666f\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u5272\u3001\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u53ec\u56de\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u6d41\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u6d41\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u7b54\u9762\u4e34\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u987a\u5e8f\u5230\u8fbe\u3001\u7528\u6237\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u4efb\u610f\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e22\u5931\u6216\u5185\u5b58\u6ea2\u51fa\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "Vista\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u521b\u65b0\uff1a(1) \u573a\u666f\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u805a\u7c7b\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u4e3a\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u573a\u666f\u5355\u5143\uff1b(2) \u573a\u666f\u611f\u77e5\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u7d27\u51d1token\u8868\u793a\u5b58\u4e8eGPU\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5e27\u5378\u8f7d\u81f3CPU\uff1b(3) \u573a\u666f\u611f\u77e5\u53ec\u56de\uff0c\u6309\u9700\u68c0\u7d22\u5e76\u91cd\u6574\u5408\u76f8\u5173\u573a\u666f\u5230\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5728StreamingBench\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cVista\u8fbe\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u6d41\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "Vista\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6d41\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891QA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u63a8\u7406\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u5b9e\u65f6\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

Current methods primarily focus on spatial-temporal modeling or independent frequency domain analysis, lacking a unified framework for joint optimization across spatial, temporal, and frequency domains. This limitation hinders the model's ability to leverage information from all domains simultaneously, leading to suboptimal generation quality. Additionally, in motion generation frameworks, motion-irrelevant cues caused by noise are often entangled with features that contribute positively to generation, thereby leading to motion distortion. To address these issues, we propose Tri-Domain Causal Text-to-Motion Generation (TriC-Motion), a novel diffusion-based framework integrating spatial-temporal-frequency-domain modeling with causal intervention. TriC-Motion includes three core modeling modules for domain-specific modeling, namely Temporal Motion Encoding, Spatial Topology Modeling, and Hybrid Frequency Analysis. After comprehensive modeling, a Score-guided Tri-domain Fusion module integrates valuable information from the triple domains, simultaneously ensuring temporal consistency, spatial topology, motion trends, and dynamics. Moreover, the Causality-based Counterfactual Motion Disentangler is meticulously designed to expose motion-irrelevant cues to eliminate noise, disentangling the real modeling contributions of each domain for superior generation. Extensive experimental results validate that TriC-Motion achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, attaining an outstanding R@1 of 0.612 on the HumanML3D dataset. These results demonstrate its capability to generate high-fidelity, coherent, diverse, and text-aligned motion sequences.

This problem becomes more apparent when autonomous vehicles (AVs) struggle to interpret such gestures. In this study, we present a gesture classification framework using 2D pose estimation applied to real-world video sequences from the WIVW dataset. We categorise gestures into four primary classes (Stop, Go, Thank & Greet, and No Gesture) and extract 76 static and dynamic features from normalised keypoints. Our analysis demonstrates that hand position and movement velocity are especially discriminative in distinguishing between gesture classes, achieving a classification accuracy score of 87%. These findings not only improve the perceptual capabilities of AV systems but also contribute to the broader understanding of pedestrian behaviour in traffic contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e2D\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u573a\u666f\u624b\u52bf\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528WIVW\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u63d0\u53d676\u4e2a\u9759\u6001\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u56db\u7c7b\u624b\u52bf\uff08Stop\u3001Go\u3001Thank & Greet\u3001No Gesture\uff09\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe87%\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u624b\u90e8\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0e\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5224\u522b\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\uff08AVs\uff09\u96be\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u884c\u4eba\u624b\u52bf\uff0c\u800c\u624b\u52bf\u5728\u4ea4\u901a\u4e2d\u662f\u975e\u6b63\u5f0f\u89c4\u5219\u4e0b\u4eba\u8f66\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u975e\u8bed\u8a00\u6c9f\u901a\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eWIVW\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u91c7\u75282D\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u53d6\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5173\u952e\u70b9\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b76\u4e2a\u9759\u6001\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u624b\u52bf\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf9\u56db\u7c7b\u624b\u52bf\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u624b\u90e8\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u901f\u5ea6\u662f\u6700\u5177\u5224\u522b\u6027\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523087%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86AV\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u8fdb\u4e86\u5bf9\u4ea4\u901a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u884c\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

While recent studies have shown that lighting variations can significantly distort food perception by both humans and AI, existing works are often limited to single food categories or controlled settings, and most public food datasets lack explicit illumination annotations.\n  In this work, we investigate illumination-induced domain shift in multi-class food category recognition using two widely adopted datasets, Food-101 and Fruits-360. We demonstrate substantial accuracy degradation under cross-dataset evaluation due to mismatched visual conditions. To address this challenge, we construct synthetic illumination-augmented datasets by systematically varying light temperature and intensity, enabling controlled robustness analysis without additional labels.\n  We further evaluate cross-dataset transfer learning and domain generalization, with a focus on illumination-sensitive target categories such as apple-based classes. Experimental results show that illumination-aware augmentation significantly improves recognition robustness under domain shift while preserving real-time performance. Our findings highlight the importance of illumination robustness and provide practical insights for deploying reliable food recognition systems in real-world inspection scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5149\u7167\u53d8\u5316\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u5bf9\u591a\u7c7b\u522b\u98df\u54c1\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5408\u6210\u5149\u7167\u589e\u5f3a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5149\u7167\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u81ea\u52a8\u4f20\u9001\u5e26\u68c0\u6d4b\uff09\u4e2d\u98df\u54c1\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u5149\u7167\u53d8\u5316\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u7c7b\u98df\u54c1\u6216\u53d7\u63a7\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u4e14\u516c\u5f00\u98df\u54c1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u666e\u904d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u7684\u5149\u7167\u6807\u6ce8\u3002", "method": "\u5728Food-101\u548cFruits-360\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5f00\u5c55\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d8\u5316\u8272\u6e29\u4e0e\u5149\u7167\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u5408\u6210\u5149\u7167\u589e\u5f3a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u5f00\u5c55\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u82f9\u679c\u7c7b\u7b49\u5bf9\u5149\u7167\u654f\u611f\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5149\u7167\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u5bfc\u81f4\u663e\u8457\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u5149\u7167\u611f\u77e5\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5149\u7167\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u98df\u54c1\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u68c0\u9a8c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u53ef\u9760\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6d1e\u89c1\u3002"}}

A critical question is whether statistically detectable heterogeneity translates into improved treatment decisions -- these are distinct questions that can yield contradictory answers. We present a modular causal machine learning framework that evaluates each question separately: permutation importance identifies which features predict heterogeneity, best linear predictor (BLP) testing assesses statistical significance, and doubly robust policy evaluation measures whether acting on the heterogeneity improves patient outcomes. We apply this framework to patient-level data from the UNIFI maintenance trial of ustekinumab in ulcerative colitis, comparing placebo, standard-dose ustekinumab every 12 weeks, and dose-intensified ustekinumab every 8 weeks, using cross-fitted X-learner models with baseline demographics, medication history, week-8 clinical scores, laboratory biomarkers, and video-derived endoscopic features. BLP testing identified strong associations between endoscopic features and treatment effect heterogeneity for ustekinumab versus placebo, yet doubly robust policy evaluation showed no improvement in expected remission from incorporating endoscopic features, and out-of-fold multi-arm evaluation showed worse performance. Diagnostic comparison of prognostic contribution against policy value revealed that endoscopic scores behaved as disease severity markers -- improving outcome prediction in untreated patients but adding noise to treatment selection -- while clinical variables (fecal calprotectin, age, CRP) captured the decision-relevant variation. These results demonstrate that causal machine learning applications to clinical trials should include policy-level evaluation alongside heterogeneity testing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u522b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6cbb\u7597\u6548\u5e94\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u6027\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728UC\u60a3\u8005\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1a\u5185\u955c\u7279\u5f81\u867d\u4e0e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u6cbb\u7597\u51b3\u7b56\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u800c\u4e34\u5e8a\u53d8\u91cf\uff08\u5982\u7caa\u4fbf\u9499\u536b\u86cb\u767d\u3001\u5e74\u9f84\u3001CRP\uff09\u66f4\u5229\u4e8e\u6307\u5bfc\u6cbb\u7597\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u673a\u5bf9\u7167\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4f30\u8ba1\u5e73\u5747\u5904\u7406\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4f46\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u9700\u5173\u6ce8\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316\u6cbb\u7597\uff1b\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u662f\uff1a\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0a\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u662f\u5426\u771f\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u6cbb\u7597\u51b3\u7b56\uff1f\u4e8c\u8005\u53ef\u80fd\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u9700\u5206\u522b\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u6b65\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u56e0\u679c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u7f6e\u6362\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u8bc6\u522b\u9884\u6d4b\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2\uff09\u6700\u4f73\u7ebf\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\uff08BLP\uff09\u68c0\u9a8c\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u6027\uff1b3\uff09\u53cc\u91cd\u7a33\u5065\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08doubly robust policy evaluation\uff09\u8861\u91cf\u5229\u7528\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u662f\u5426\u63d0\u5347\u60a3\u8005\u7ed3\u5c40\u3002\u5728UNIFI\u7ef4\u6301\u8bd5\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4ea4\u53c9\u62df\u5408X-learner\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8f93\u5165\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u7ebf\u4eba\u53e3\u5b66\u3001\u7528\u836f\u53f2\u3001\u7b2c8\u5468\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bc4\u5206\u3001\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u6307\u6807\u53ca\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u955c\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "BLP\u68c0\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\u5185\u955c\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u4e4c\u53f8\u5974\u5355\u6297vs\u5b89\u6170\u5242\u7684\u6cbb\u7597\u6548\u5e94\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u4f46\u53cc\u91cd\u7a33\u5065\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u7eb3\u5165\u5185\u955c\u7279\u5f81\u672a\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u671f\u7f13\u89e3\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u591a\u81c2\u7559\u51fa\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u5dee\uff1b\u8bca\u65ad\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u5185\u955c\u8bc4\u5206\u4e3b\u8981\u53cd\u6620\u75be\u75c5\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff08\u5bf9\u672a\u6cbb\u7597\u8005\u9884\u6d4b\u597d\uff09\uff0c\u5374\u5e72\u6270\u6cbb\u7597\u9009\u62e9\uff1b\u800c\u7caa\u4fbf\u9499\u536b\u86cb\u767d\u3001\u5e74\u9f84\u3001CRP\u7b49\u4e34\u5e8a\u53d8\u91cf\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u51b3\u7b56\u76f8\u5173\u53d8\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56e0\u679c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u65f6\uff0c\u9664\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u68c0\u9a8c\u5916\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u5305\u542b\u7b56\u7565\u5c42\u9762\uff08policy-level\uff09\u7684\u6548\u679c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5c06\u7eaf\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u8bef\u7528\u4e3a\u6cbb\u7597\u9009\u62e9\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

Here, we study this question for the problem of mitochondria segmentation in electron microscopy (EM) images, using two popular public EM datasets (Lucchi++ and VNC) and three recent representative VFMs (DINOv2, DINOv3, and OpenCLIP). We evaluate two practical model adaptation regimes: a frozen-backbone setting in which only a lightweight segmentation head is trained on top of the VFM, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in which the VFM is fine-tuned in a targeted manner to a specific dataset. Across all backbones, we observe that training on a single EM dataset yields good segmentation performance (quantified as foreground Intersection-over-Union), and that LoRA consistently improves in-domain performance. In contrast, training on multiple EM datasets leads to severe performance degradation for all models considered, with only marginal gains from PEFT. Exploration of the latent representation space through various techniques (PCA, Fr\u00e9chet Dinov2 distance, and linear probes) reveals a pronounced and persistent domain mismatch between the two considered EM datasets in spite of their visual similarity, which is consistent with the observed failure of paired training. These results suggest that, while VFMs can deliver competitive results for EM segmentation within a single domain under lightweight adaptation, current PEFT strategies are insufficient to obtain a single robust model across heterogeneous EM datasets without additional domain-alignment mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08VFMs\uff09\u5728\u7535\u5b50\u663e\u5fae\u955c\uff08EM\uff09\u56fe\u50cf\u7ebf\u7c92\u4f53\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5c3d\u7ba1VFMs\u5728\u5355\u4e2aEM\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5f02\u6784EM\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u9886\u57df\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff08\u5982LoRA\uff09\u7b56\u7565\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u514b\u670d\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u5f15\u5165\u989d\u5916\u7684\u9886\u57df\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08VFMs\uff09\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u5f81\u662f\u5426\u8db3\u591f\u901a\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u95f4\u6709\u6548\u8fc1\u79fb\u548c\u91cd\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7ebf\u7c92\u4f53\u5206\u5272\u8fd9\u4e00\u5178\u578bEM\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u5728Lucchi++\u548cVNC\u4e24\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00EM\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30DINOv2\u3001DINOv3\u548cOpenCLIP\u4e09\u79cdVFMs\uff1b\u6bd4\u8f83\u51bb\u7ed3\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc+\u8f7b\u91cf\u5206\u5272\u5934\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8eLoRA\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff08PEFT\uff09\u4e24\u79cd\u9002\u914d\u8303\u5f0f\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7PCA\u3001Fr\u00e9chet DINOv2\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u9886\u57df\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u5355\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0b\u6240\u6709VFMs\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u524d\u666fIoU\uff09\uff0cLoRA\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u57df\u5185\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u4f46\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bfc\u81f4\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0cPEFT\u4ec5\u5e26\u6765\u5fae\u5f31\u589e\u76ca\uff1b\u8868\u5f81\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e24EM\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u9886\u57df\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002", "conclusion": "VFMs\u53ef\u5728\u5355EM\u9886\u57df\u4e0b\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u9002\u914d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u5206\u5272\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524dPEFT\u7b56\u7565\u5c1a\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u6784\u5efa\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u5f02\u6784EM\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5f15\u5165\u9886\u57df\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

While fractional Brownian motion has been widely used as a noise source to capture such memory effects, its incompatibility with It\u00f4 calculus limits its applicability in neural stochastic differential equation~(SDE) frameworks. In this paper, we propose a novel class of noise, termed Neural Network-kernel ARMA-type noise~(NA-noise), which is an It\u00f4-process-based alternative capable of capturing both long- and short-memory behaviors. The kernel function defining the noise structure is parameterized via neural networks and decomposed into a product form to preserve the Markov property. Based on this noise process, we develop NANSDE-Net, a generative model that extends Neural SDEs by incorporating NA-noise. We prove the theoretical existence and uniqueness of the solution under mild conditions and derive an efficient backpropagation scheme for training. Empirical results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that NANSDE-Net matches or outperforms existing models, including fractional SDE-Net, in reproducing long- and short-memory features of the data, while maintaining computational tractability within the It\u00f4 calculus framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9a71\u52a8\u7684ARMA\u578b\u566a\u58f0\uff08NA-noise\uff09\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5206\u6570\u5e03\u6717\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684It\u00f4\u76f8\u5bb9\u66ff\u4ee3\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u5177\u6709\u957f/\u77ed\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u968f\u673a\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08NANSDE-Net\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7406\u8bba\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u65f6\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u6570\u5e03\u6717\u8fd0\u52a8\u867d\u80fd\u523b\u753b\u957f/\u77ed\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9It\u00f4\u5fae\u79ef\u5206\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u5176\u5728\u795e\u7ecfSDE\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff1b\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u5177\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u53c8\u6ee1\u8db3It\u00f4\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6784\u9020\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNA-noise\uff1a\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6838\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e58\u79ef\u5f62\u5f0f\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301Markov\u6027\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u6784\u5efaNANSDE-Net\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u7ed9\u51fa\u89e3\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u552f\u4e00\u6027\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9ad8\u6548\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cNANSDE-Net\u5728\u590d\u73b0\u957f/\u77ed\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7279\u5f81\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u4f18\u4e8efractional SDE-Net\u7b49\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u6301It\u00f4\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "NA-noise\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecfSDE\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u517c\u5177\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u4e0eIt\u00f4\u76f8\u5bb9\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u566a\u58f0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0cNANSDE-Net\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

By replacing bulky code-based encodings, VertexLang reduces global perception training time by 20% while improving topology recognition accuracy.

As such data often co-evolves with multiple variables interacting with each other, estimating the time-varying dependencies between variables (i.e., the dynamic network structure) has become crucial for accurate modeling. However, real-world data is often represented as tensor time series with multiple modes, resulting in large, entangled networks that are hard to interpret and computationally intensive to estimate. In this paper, we propose Kronecker Time-Varying Graphical Lasso (KTVGL), a method designed for modeling tensor time series. Our approach estimates mode-specific dynamic networks in a Kronecker product form, thereby avoiding overly complex entangled structures and producing interpretable modeling results. Moreover, the partitioned network structure prevents the exponential growth of computational time with data dimension. In addition, our method can be extended to stream algorithms, making the computational time independent of the sequence length. Experiments on synthetic data show that the proposed method achieves higher edge estimation accuracy than existing methods while requiring less computation time. To further demonstrate its practical value, we also present a case study using real-world data.

We empirically demonstrate that these intrinsic flaws impose a hard performance ceiling. To overcome this limitation, we propose CADO (Cost-Aware Diffusion models for Optimization), a streamlined Reinforcement Learning fine-tuning framework that formulates the diffusion denoising process as an MDP to directly optimize the post-decoded solution cost. We introduce Label-Centered Reward, which repurposes ground-truth labels as unbiased baselines rather than imitation targets, and Hybrid Fine-Tuning for parameter-efficient adaptation.

The camera-ready version will be updated soon", "summary": "Human perception for effective object tracking in a 2D video stream arises from the implicit use of prior 3D knowledge combined with semantic reasoning. In contrast, most generic object tracking (GOT) methods primarily rely on 2D features of the target and its surroundings while neglecting 3D geometric cues, which makes them susceptible to partial occlusion, distractors, and variations in geometry and appearance. To address this limitation, we introduce GOT-Edit, an online cross-modality model editing approach that integrates geometry-aware cues into a generic object tracker from a 2D video stream. Our approach leverages features from a pre-trained Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer to enable geometric cue inference from only a few 2D images. To tackle the challenge of seamlessly combining geometry and semantics, GOT-Edit performs online model editing with null-space constrained updates that incorporate geometric information while preserving semantic discrimination, yielding consistently better performance across diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments on multiple GOT benchmarks demonstrate that GOT-Edit achieves superior robustness and accuracy, particularly under occlusion and clutter, establishing a new paradigm for combining 2D semantics with 3D geometric reasoning for generic object tracking.", "AI": {"tldr": "GOT-Edit \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u7ebf\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u7ebf\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a2D\u901a\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u7840Transformer\u4ece\u5c11\u91cf2D\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u63a8\u65ad3D\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u878d\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u906e\u6321\u548c\u6742\u4e71\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u901a\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff08GOT\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d562D\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5ffd\u75653D\u51e0\u4f55\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u906e\u6321\u3001\u5e72\u6270\u7269\u53ca\u5916\u89c2/\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u800c\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4f9d\u8d56\u9690\u5f0f3D\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u5c063D\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u51652D\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa GOT-Edit\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u7840Transformer\u63d0\u53d6\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u96f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5c06\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u5d4c\u5165\u539f\u67092D\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5668\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u8bed\u4e49\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aGOT\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGOT-Edit\u5728\u906e\u6321\u548c\u6742\u4e71\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8ddf\u8e2a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "GOT-Edit \u6210\u529f\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u878d\u54082D\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e3D\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u7ebf\u7d22\u5bf9\u901a\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

We, therefore, propose a novel application of conformal prediction to produce distribution-free uncertainty quantification over the function spaces mapped by neural operators.

Existing methods typically rely on a single Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to model temporal deformations, and they often struggle to capture complex point motions and fine-grained dynamic details consistently over time, especially from sparse input views. Our approach, FLAG-4D, overcomes this by employing a dual-deformation network that dynamically warps a canonical set of 3D Gaussians over time into new positions and anisotropic shapes. This dual-deformation network consists of an Instantaneous Deformation Network (IDN) for modeling fine-grained, local deformations and a Global Motion Network (GMN) for capturing long-range dynamics, refined through mutual learning. To ensure these deformations are both accurate and temporally smooth, FLAG-4D incorporates dense motion features from a pretrained optical flow backbone. We fuse these motion cues from adjacent timeframes and use a deformation-guided attention mechanism to align this flow information with the current state of each evolving 3D Gaussian.

Based on a thermodynamic framework for Transformer architectures. Derives the equation of state from first principles", "summary": "Although the Transformer architecture has revolutionized artificial intelligence, its underlying mechanisms remain largely heuristic and lack a unified physical theory. In this work, we propose a first-principles framework for information dynamics, treating the attention mechanism as a physical system governed by the principle of least action rather than as an algorithmic optimization. By mapping information states to a Riemannian manifold with the Fisher information metric, we derive the intelligence Lagrangian. We show that the softmax function corresponds to the unique thermodynamic equilibrium state that minimizes the Helmholtz free energy of the information gas. In addition, we identify the query-key interaction as an electrodynamic coupling between an external field and an intrinsic dipole moment. This theory establishes the first law of information thermodynamics, unifying inference (mechanical work) and learning (chemical evolution). It also explains emergent phenomena, such as scaling laws and grokking, as phase transitions characterized by the divergence of specific heat. Finally, we discuss how rotational symmetry breaking in the attention manifold generates massless Goldstone bosons, providing a field-theoretic perspective on rotary positional embeddings (RoPE).

Reference-based methods offer a promising alternative by transferring the preset color of a reference image to a source image. However, these approaches often operate as novice learners, performing global color mappings derived from pixel-level statistics, without a true understanding of semantic context or human aesthetics. To address this issue, we propose SemiNFT, a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based retouching framework that mirrors the trajectory of human artistic training: beginning with rigid imitation and evolving into intuitive creation. Specifically, SemiNFT is first taught with paired triplets to acquire basic structural preservation and color mapping skills, and then advanced to reinforcement learning (RL) on unpaired data to cultivate nuanced aesthetic perception. Crucially, during the RL stage, to prevent catastrophic forgetting of old skills, we design a hybrid online-offline reward mechanism that anchors aesthetic exploration with structural review. % experiments Extensive experiments show that SemiNFT not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard preset transfer benchmarks but also demonstrates remarkable intelligence in zero-shot tasks, such as black-and-white photo colorization and cross-domain (anime-to-photo) preset transfer. These results confirm that SemiNFT transcends simple statistical matching and achieves a sophisticated level of aesthetic comprehension.

Therefore, point cloud compression plays a crucial role in practical applications for both human and machine perception optimization. To this end, the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) has established two standards for point cloud compression, including Geometry-based Point Cloud Compression (G-PCC) and Video-based Point Cloud Compression (V-PCC).

Existing memory-based methods primarily store raw trajectories, which are often redundant and noise-heavy. This prevents agents from extracting high-level, reusable behavioral patterns that are essential for generalization. In this paper, we propose SkillRL, a framework that bridges the gap between raw experience and policy improvement through automatic skill discovery and recursive evolution. Our approach introduces an experience-based distillation mechanism to build a hierarchical skill library SkillBank, an adaptive retrieval strategy for general and task-specific heuristics, and a recursive evolution mechanism that allows the skill library to co-evolve with the agent's policy during reinforcement learning. These innovations significantly reduce the token footprint while enhancing reasoning utility. Experimental results on ALFWorld, WebShop and seven search-augmented tasks demonstrate that SkillRL achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines over 15.3% and maintaining robustness as task complexity increases.

Yet, the mechanisms underlying their training performance and generalization remain underexplored. In this paper, we provide several insights into such fine-tuning through the lens of linearization. Fine-tuned models are often implicitly encouraged to remain close to the pretrained model. By making this explicit, using an Euclidean distance inductive bias in parameter space, we show that fine-tuning dynamics become equivalent to learning with the positive-definite neural tangent kernel (NTK). We specifically analyze how close the fully linear and the linearized fine-tuning optimizations are, based on the strength of the regularization. This allows us to be pragmatic about how good a model linearization is when fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). When linearization is a good model, our findings reveal a strong correlation between the eigenvalue spectrum of the NTK and the performance of model adaptation. Motivated by this, we give spectral perturbation bounds on the NTK induced by the choice of layers selected for fine-tuning.

We further observe that the resulting high-dimensional, information-rich latent make decoders sensitive to latent perturbations, causing severe artifacts when decoding generated latent and consequently degrading generation quality. Our analysis suggests that this sensitivity primarily stems from excessive decoder responses along directions off the data manifold. Building on these insights, we propose fine-tuning the decoder to increase its robustness and smoothing the generated latent via controlled noise injection, thereby enhancing generation quality. Experiments demonstrate that LV-RAE significantly improves reconstruction fidelity while preserving the semantic abstraction and achieving strong generative quality.

However, existing ICRL methods rely on explicit reward signals during pretraining, which limits their applicability when rewards are ambiguous, hard to specify, or costly to obtain. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new learning paradigm, In-Context Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (ICPRL), in which both pretraining and deployment rely solely on preference feedback, eliminating the need for reward supervision. We study two variants that differ in the granularity of feedback: Immediate Preference-based RL (I-PRL) with per-step preferences, and Trajectory Preference-based RL (T-PRL) with trajectory-level comparisons. We first show that supervised pretraining, a standard approach in ICRL, remains effective under preference-only context datasets, demonstrating the feasibility of in-context reinforcement learning using only preference signals. To further improve data efficiency, we introduce alternative preference-native frameworks for I-PRL and T-PRL that directly optimize TM policies from preference data without requiring reward signals nor optimal action labels.Experiments on dueling bandits, navigation, and continuous control tasks demonstrate that ICPRL enables strong in-context generalization to unseen tasks, achieving performance comparable to ICRL methods trained with full reward supervision.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u2014\u2014\u57fa\u4e8e\u504f\u597d\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ICPRL\uff09\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u504f\u597d\u53cd\u9988\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u53cd\u9988\u7c92\u5ea6\u53d8\u4f53\uff08\u6bcf\u6b65\u504f\u597dI-PRL\u4e0e\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u504f\u597dT-PRL\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u6709\u5956\u52b1\u76d1\u7763\u7684ICRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ICRL\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u663e\u5f0f\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9a\u4e49\u6216\u83b7\u53d6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u65f6\u9002\u7528\u6027\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u504f\u597d\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ICPRL\uff09\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u53d8\u4f53\uff1a\u6bcf\u6b65\u504f\u597d\uff08I-PRL\uff09\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u504f\u597d\uff08T-PRL\uff09\uff1b\u5728\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u504f\u597d\u539f\u751f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u4f18\u5316Transformer\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u6216\u6700\u4f18\u52a8\u4f5c\u6807\u7b7e\u3002", "result": "\u5728dueling bandits\u3001\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cICPRL\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8e\u4f7f\u7528\u5b8c\u6574\u5956\u52b1\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684ICRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ICPRL\u6210\u529f\u6446\u8131\u5bf9\u663e\u5f0f\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u4ec5\u7528\u504f\u597d\u53cd\u9988\u5373\u53ef\u652f\u6491\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86ICRL\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u7a00\u758f/\u6a21\u7cca\u5956\u52b1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

To capture both global and local features, a learnable [CLS] class token is typically prepended to the input sequence of patch tokens. Despite their distinct nature, both token types are processed identically throughout the model. In this work, we investigate the friction between global and local feature learning under different pre-training strategies by analyzing the interactions between class and patch tokens. Our analysis reveals that standard normalization layers introduce an implicit differentiation between these token types. Building on this insight, we propose specialized processing paths that selectively disentangle the computational flow of class and patch tokens, particularly within normalization layers and early query-key-value projections. This targeted specialization leads to significantly improved patch representation quality for dense prediction tasks. Our experiments demonstrate segmentation performance gains of over 2 mIoU points on standard benchmarks, while maintaining strong classification accuracy.

Although Decision Transformers provide powerful sequence modeling capabilities, applying them to this constrained setting encounters two challenges: 1) standard Return-to-Go conditioning causes state aliasing by neglecting the cost dimension, preventing precise resource pacing; and 2) standard regression forces the policy to mimic average historical behaviors, thereby limiting the capacity to optimize performance toward the constraint boundary. To address these challenges, we propose PRO-Bid, a constraint-aware generative auto-bidding framework based on two synergistic mechanisms: 1) Constraint-Decoupled Pareto Representation (CDPR) decomposes global constraints into recursive cost and value contexts to restore resource perception, while reweighting trajectories based on the Pareto frontier to focus on high-efficiency data; and 2) Counterfactual Regret Optimization (CRO) facilitates active improvement by utilizing a global outcome predictor to identify superior counterfactual actions. By treating these high-utility outcomes as weighted regression targets, the model transcends historical averages to approach the optimal constraint boundary. Extensive experiments on two public benchmarks and online A/B tests demonstrate that PRO-Bid achieves superior constraint satisfaction and value acquisition compared to state-of-the-art baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPRO-Bid\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u8868\u5f81\uff08CDPR\uff09\u548c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9057\u61be\u4f18\u5316\uff08CRO\uff09\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u52a8\u51fa\u4ef7\u4e2d\u72b6\u6001\u6df7\u6dc6\u4e0e\u5386\u53f2\u5e73\u5747\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e25\u683c\u6548\u7387\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u5982\u76ee\u6807CPA\uff09\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u8425\u9500\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eDecision Transformer\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u51fa\u4ef7\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406Target CPA\u7b49\u4e25\u683c\u6548\u7387\u7ea6\u675f\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u6df7\u53e0\uff08\u5ffd\u7565\u6210\u672c\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff09\u548c\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2\u5e73\u5747\u884c\u4e3a\u4e24\u5927\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u7cbe\u51c6\u8d44\u6e90\u8c03\u63a7\u5e76\u903c\u8fd1\u7ea6\u675f\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPRO-Bid\uff1a1\uff09Constraint-Decoupled Pareto Representation\uff08CDPR\uff09\u5c06\u5168\u5c40\u7ea6\u675f\u9012\u5f52\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u4ef7\u503c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b2\uff09Counterfactual Regret Optimization\uff08CRO\uff09\u5229\u7528\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u679c\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u8bc6\u522b\u66f4\u4f18\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u52a0\u6743\u56de\u5f52\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6\u53ca\u7ebf\u4e0aA/B\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cPRO-Bid\u76f8\u8f83SOTA\u57fa\u7ebf\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u7387\u4e0e\u4ef7\u503c\u83b7\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "PRO-Bid\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7ea6\u675f\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u81ea\u52a8\u51fa\u4ef7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u8d44\u6e90\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u7a81\u7834\u5386\u53f2\u5e73\u5747\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u3002"}}

Such unknown transformations arise widely in machine learning and scientific modeling, where they can significantly distort observations. We take a probabilistic view and model the posterior over transformations as a Boltzmann distribution defined by an energy function on data space. To sample from this posterior, we introduce a diffusion process on Lie groups that keeps all updates on-manifold and only requires computations in the associated Lie algebra. Our method, Transformation-Inverting Energy Diffusion (TIED), relies on a new trivialized target-score identity that enables efficient score-based sampling of the transformation posterior. As a key application, we focus on test-time equivariance, where the objective is to improve the robustness of pretrained neural networks to input transformations. Experiments on image homographies and PDE symmetries demonstrate that TIED can restore transformed inputs to the training distribution at test time, showing improved performance over strong canonicalization and sampling baselines.

While WiFi-based methods have gained traction, they often struggle with continuous motion and high computational overhead. This work presents WiFlow, a novel framework for continuous human pose estimation using WiFi signals. Unlike vision-based approaches such as two-dimensional deep residual networks that treat Channel State Information (CSI) as images, WiFlow employs an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder captures spatio-temporal features of CSI using temporal and asymmetric convolutions, preserving the original sequential structure of signals. It then refines keypoint features of human bodies to be tracked and capture their structural dependencies via axial attention. The decoder subsequently maps the encoded high-dimensional features into keypoint coordinates. Trained on a self-collected dataset of 360,000 synchronized CSI-pose samples from 5 subjects performing continuous sequences of 8 daily activities, WiFlow achieves a Percentage of Correct Keypoints (PCK) of 97.00% at a threshold of 20% (PCK@20) and 99.48% at PCK@50, with a mean per-joint position error of 0.008m. With only 4.82M parameters, WiFlow significantly reduces model complexity and computational cost, establishing a new performance baseline for practical WiFi-based human pose estimation.

Analysing the Learning Efficiency of Agentic Systems", "comment": null, "summary": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a crucial method for training or fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), enabling adaptive, task-specific optimizations through interactive feedback. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), in particular, offers a promising avenue by decomposing complex tasks into specialized subtasks learned by distinct interacting agents, potentially enhancing the ability and efficiency of LLM systems. However, theoretical insights regarding when and why MARL outperforms Single-Agent RL (SARL) remain limited, creating uncertainty in selecting the appropriate RL framework. In this paper, we address this critical gap by rigorously analyzing the comparative sample efficiency of MARL and SARL within the context of LLM. Leveraging the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) framework, we formally define SARL and MARL setups for LLMs, derive explicit sample complexity bounds, and systematically characterize how task decomposition and alignment influence learning efficiency. Our results demonstrate that MARL improves sample complexity when tasks naturally decompose into independent subtasks, whereas dependent subtasks diminish MARL's comparative advantage. Additionally, we introduce and analyze the concept of task alignment, quantifying the trade-offs when enforcing independent task decomposition despite potential misalignments. These theoretical insights clarify empirical inconsistencies and provide practical criteria for deploying MARL strategies effectively in complex LLM scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7PAC\u6846\u67b6\u4e25\u683c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MARL\uff09\u4e0e\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08SARL\uff09\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u6307\u51faMARL\u4ec5\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u5929\u7136\u53ef\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u800c\u4efb\u52a1\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u6216\u5bf9\u9f50\u504f\u5dee\u4f1a\u524a\u5f31\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9MARL\u4e3a\u4f55\u53ca\u4f55\u65f6\u4f18\u4e8eSARL\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2dRL\u6846\u67b6\u9009\u62e9\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8ePAC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5b9a\u4e49LLM\u4e0b\u7684SARL\u4e0eMARL\u8bbe\u5b9a\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u523b\u753b\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660eMARL\u5728\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u72ec\u7acb\u65f6\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff1b\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u4f9d\u8d56\u65f6\u4f18\u52bf\u51cf\u5f31\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u2018\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u9f50\u2019\u6982\u5ff5\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u5f3a\u5236\u72ec\u7acb\u5206\u89e3\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u7ecf\u9a8c\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3aLLM\u4e2dMARL\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u51c6\u5219\u3002"}}

It can improve the accuracy and stability of low-resolution simulation compared with using traditional finite difference or finite volume schemes. Meanwhile, it can also benefit from traditional numerical schemes like achieving conservation law by adapting finite volume type formulations. In this thesis, we have implemented the shallow water equation and Euler equation classic solver under a different framework.

A common metric for this, inspired by Boolean function analysis, is average sensitivity, which captures a model's robustness to single-token perturbations. We argue that average sensitivity has two key limitations: it lacks a natural generalization to real-valued domains and fails to explain the \"junta-like\" input dependence we empirically observe in modern LLMs. To address these limitations, we propose noise stability as a more comprehensive simplicity metric. Noise stability expresses a model's robustness to correlated noise applied to all input coordinates simultaneously. We provide a theoretical analysis of noise stability for single-layer attention and ReLU MLP layers and tackle the multi-layer propagation problem with a covariance interval propagation approach. Building on this theory, we develop a practical noise stability regularization method. Experiments on algorithmic and next-token-prediction tasks show that our regularizer consistently catalyzes grokking and accelerates training by approximately $35\\%$ and $75\\%$ respectively.

To support the audio-visual synchronization and reference animation, we augment the popular MMDiT architecture with a joint audio-video branch which includes TA-CrossAttn for temporally-aligned cross-modal fusion and UniTemp-RoPE for precise audio-visual alignment. Meanwhile, a comprehensive data pipeline consisting of audio-video captioning, quality control, etc., is carefully designed to collect high-quality finetuning data. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark to perform a comprehensive model test and comparison. After continue pretraining and finetuning on million-level high-quality data, ALIVE demonstrates outstanding performance, consistently outperforming open-source models and matching or surpassing state-of-the-art commercial solutions.

This paper proposes a novel trust-based incentive mechanism designed to evaluate and reward the quality of contributions in FL systems. By dynamically assessing trust scores based on fac-tors such as data quality, model accuracy, consistency, and contribution fre-quency, the system encourages honest participation and penalizes unreliable or malicious behavior. These trust scores form the basis of an incentive mechanism that rewards high-trust nodes with greater participation opportunities and penal-ties for low-trust participants. We further explore the integration of blockchain technology and smart contracts to automate the trust evaluation and incentive distribution processes, ensuring transparency and decentralization.

Artificial general intelligence is, at its core, a compression problem. Effective compression demands resonance: deep learning scales best when its architecture aligns with the fundamental structure of the data. These are the fundamental principles. Yet, modern vision architectures have strayed from these truths: visual signals are highly redundant, while discriminative information, the surprise, is sparse. Current models process dense pixel grids uniformly, wasting vast compute on static background rather than focusing on the predictive residuals that define motion and meaning. We argue that to solve visual understanding, we must align our architectures with the information-theoretic principles of video, i.e., Codecs.\n  Method. OneVision-Encoder encodes video by compressing predictive visual structure into semantic meaning. By adopting Codec Patchification, OV-Encoder abandons uniform computation to focus exclusively on the 3.1%-25% of regions rich in signal entropy. To unify spatial and temporal reasoning under irregular token layouts, OneVision-Encoder employs a shared 3D RoPE and is trained with a large-scale cluster discrimination objective over more than one million semantic concepts, jointly capturing object permanence and motion dynamics.\n  Evidence. The results validate our core hypothesis: efficiency and accuracy are not a trade-off; they are positively correlated.

We study grokking in one of the simplest possible settings: the learning of a linear model with logistic loss for binary classification on data that are linearly (and max margin) separable about the origin. We investigate three testing regimes: (1) test data drawn from the same distribution as the training data, in which case grokking is not observed; (2) test data concentrated around the margin, in which case grokking is observed; and (3) adversarial test data generated via projected gradient descent (PGD) attacks, in which case grokking is also observed. We theoretically show that the implicit bias of gradient descent induces a three-phase learning process-population-dominated, support-vector-dominated unlearning, and support-vector-dominated generalization-during which delayed generalization can arise. Our analysis further relates the emergence of grokking to asymmetries in the data, both in the number of examples per class and in the distribution of support vectors across classes, and yields a characterization of the grokking time. We experimentally validate our theory by planting different distributions of population points and support vectors, and by analyzing accuracy curves and hyperplane dynamics.

In this paper, we present an innovative video decomposition strategy that incorporates view-independent and view-dependent components to enhance the performance of LLVE. The framework is called View-aware Low-light Video Enhancement (VLLVE). We leverage dynamic cross-frame correspondences for the view-independent term (which primarily captures intrinsic appearance) and impose a scene-level continuity constraint on the view-dependent term (which mainly describes the shading condition) to achieve consistent and satisfactory decomposition results. To further ensure consistent decomposition, we introduce a dual-structure enhancement network featuring a cross-frame interaction mechanism. By supervising different frames simultaneously, this network encourages them to exhibit matching decomposition features. This mechanism can seamlessly integrate with encoder-decoder single-frame networks, incurring minimal additional parameter costs. Building upon VLLVE, we propose a more comprehensive decomposition strategy by introducing an additive residual term, resulting in VLLVE++. This residual term can simulate scene-adaptive degradations, which are difficult to model using a decomposition formulation for common scenes, thereby further enhancing the ability to capture the overall content of videos. In addition, VLLVE++ enables bidirectional learning for both enhancement and degradation-aware correspondence refinement (end-to-end manner), effectively increasing reliable correspondences while filtering out incorrect ones. Notably, VLLVE++ demonstrates strong capability in handling challenging cases, such as real-world scenes and videos with high dynamics.

However, they do not work well for deep chains. The root cause of this limitation stems from the Semantic Entanglement problem in these extended workflows. In standard textual backpropagation, feedback signals mix local critiques with upstream contexts, leading to Attribution Ambiguity. To address this challenge, we propose TextResNet, a framework that reformulates the optimization process to achieve precise signal routing via four key innovations. Firstly, in the forward pass, it enforces Additive Semantic Deltas to preserve an Identity Highway for gradient flow. Secondly, in the backward pass, it introduces Semantic Gradient Decomposition via a Semantic Projector to disentangle feedback into causally independent subspaces. Thirdly, it implements Causal Routing, which routes projected signals to their specific components.

Our results show that TextResNet not only achieves superior performance compared to TextGrad, but also exhibits remarkable stability for agentic tasks in compound AI systems where baselines collapse.

While prior work on IGL provides efficient algorithms with provable guarantees, those results are confined to single-step settings, restricting their applicability to modern sequential decision-making systems such as multi-turn Large Language Model (LLM) deployments. To bridge this gap, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm that achieves a sublinear regret guarantee for contextual episodic Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with personalized feedback. Technically, we extend the reward-estimator construction of Zhang et al. [2024a] from the single-step to the multi-step setting, addressing the unique challenges of decoding latent rewards under MDPs. Building on this estimator, we design an Inverse-Gap-Weighting (IGW) algorithm for policy optimization.

Yet despite these gains, it remains unclear how language backbone representations adapt during multimodal training and when vision-specific capabilities emerge. In this work, we present the first mechanistic analysis of VLM adaptation. Using stage-wise model diffing, a technique that isolates representational changes introduced during multimodal fine-tuning, we reveal how a language model learns to \"see\". We first identify vision-preferring features that emerge or reorient during fine-tuning. We then show that a selective subset of these features reliably encodes spatial relations, revealed through controlled shifts to spatial prompts. Finally, we trace the causal activation of these features to a small group of attention heads. Our findings show that stage-wise model diffing reveals when and where spatially grounded multimodal features arise. It also provides a clearer view of modality fusion by showing how visual grounding reshapes features that were previously text-only. This methodology enhances the interpretability of multimodal training and provides a foundation for understanding and refining how pretrained language models acquire vision-grounded capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u53d8\u5316\u8fdb\u884c\u673a\u5236\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u2018\u9636\u6bb5\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u5dee\u5206\u2019\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u5b66\u4e60\u2018\u770b\u89c1\u2019\uff1a\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u6d8c\u73b0\u6216\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u504f\u597d\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u4e2d\u90e8\u5206\u7279\u5f81\u7a33\u5b9a\u7f16\u7801\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5230\u5c11\u91cf\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u9a71\u52a8\u8be5\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u4ece\u800c\u9610\u660e\u89c6\u89c9\u63a5\u5730\u5982\u4f55\u91cd\u5851\u539f\u6709\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8bed\u8a00\u4e3b\u5e72\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u6709\u80fd\u529b\u4f55\u65f6\u51fa\u73b0\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u673a\u5236\u6027\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u9636\u6bb5\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u5dee\u5206\uff08stage-wise model diffing\uff09\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u9010\u9636\u6bb5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5fae\u8c03\u524d\u540e\u8868\u5f81\u53d8\u5316\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u63d0\u793a\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0e\u56e0\u679c\u7279\u5f81\u5f52\u56e0\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u89c6\u89c9\u504f\u597d\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u8ffd\u6eaf\u81f3\u7279\u5b9a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6d8c\u73b0\u51fa\u89c6\u89c9\u504f\u597d\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u7a33\u5b9a\u7f16\u7801\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u80fd\u529b\u53ef\u88ab\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u5c11\u91cf\u5173\u952e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\uff1b\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7a7a\u95f4\u5316\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4ea7\u751f\u65f6\u673a\u4e0e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9636\u6bb5\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u5dee\u5206\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u63ed\u793aVLM\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u63a5\u5730\u5982\u4f55\u6539\u9020\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u539f\u6709\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Therefore, it is crucial to design an algorithm that accelerates each individual test. To this end, we propose the Flow Matching-based Conditional Independence Test (FMCIT). The proposed test leverages the high computational efficiency of flow matching and requires the model to be trained only once throughout the entire causal discovery procedure, substantially accelerating causal discovery. According to numerical experiments, FMCIT effectively controls type-I error and maintains high testing power under the alternative hypothesis, even in the presence of high-dimensional conditioning sets. In addition, we further integrate FMCIT into a two-stage guided PC skeleton learning framework, termed GPC-FMCIT, which combines fast screening with guided, budgeted refinement using FMCIT. This design yields explicit bounds on the number of CI queries while maintaining high statistical power.

We propose and systematically evaluate three training-free pipelines: (1) a segmentation-driven rule-based system leveraging pre-trained multi-organ segmentation models, (2) a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) guided by radiologist-defined rules, and (3) a segmentation-aware MLLM that combines visual input with explicit anatomical evidence. All methods are evaluated on 887 heterogeneous CT and MR scans with manually verified anatomical region labels. The segmentation-driven rule-based approach achieves the strongest and most consistent performance, with weighted F1-scores of 0.947 (CT) and 0.914 (MR), demonstrating robustness across modalities and atypical scan coverage.

Existing CoT compression methods often suffer from a critical loss of logical fidelity at high compression ratios, resulting in significant performance degradation. To achieve high-fidelity, fast reasoning, we propose a novel EXTreme-RAtio Chain-of-Thought Compression framework, termed Extra-CoT, which aggressively reduces the token budget while preserving answer accuracy. To generate reliable, high-fidelity supervision, we first train a dedicated semantically-preserved compressor on mathematical CoT data with fine-grained annotations. An LLM is then fine-tuned on these compressed pairs via a mixed-ratio supervised fine-tuning (SFT), teaching it to follow a spectrum of compression budgets and providing a stable initialization for reinforcement learning (RL).

Although near-oracle top-k KV selection can preserve the quality of dense attention while sharply reducing computation and bandwidth, existing sparse methods generally rely on posterior heuristics, i.e., selectors conditioned on observed attention or proxy scores. Such conditioning introduces posterior bias: it tends to distort true token importance and miss salient tokens, thereby impairing long-range reasoning. To tackle this problem, we propose Pre-hoc Sparsity (PrHS), which selects KV entries before attention scoring and provides explicit accuracy control. Let the attention mass of discarded entries be delta (the dropped mass). Through a marginal-to-mutual-information analysis, we derive an upper bound on the mutual-information loss that depends only on the dropped mass. This relation explains failure modes of posterior heuristics and enables verifiable guarantees by controlling the dropped mass in advance. Within PrHS, we instantiate three orthogonal pre-hoc selectors along the axes of time, depth, and layer. Extensive experiments on LLaMA and Mistral families validate PrHS. Across GSM8K and CoQA, PrHS reduces retrieval overhead by over 90%, achieving 3x higher retrieval sparsity than HShare at matched or better accuracy. It incurs under 1% average degradation on LongBench, lowers attention FLOPs by about 15% versus prior sparse baselines, and yields a 9.9x speedup in attention-operator latency and 2.8x higher throughput on NVIDIA A100-80GB GPUs than the dense baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aPre-hoc Sparsity\uff08PrHS\uff09\u7684KV\u7f13\u5b58\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6253\u5206\u524d\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u540e\u9a8c\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7a00\u758fKV\u7f13\u5b58\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u540e\u9a8c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\uff08\u5982\u57fa\u4e8e\u5df2\u8ba1\u7b97\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6570\u7684\u9009\u62e9\uff09\uff0c\u6613\u5f15\u5165\u540e\u9a8c\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u635f\u5bb3\u957f\u7a0b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPrHS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6253\u5206\u524d\u8fdb\u884cKV\u9009\u62e9\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fb9\u9645\u5230\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4e22\u5f03\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff08dropped mass delta\uff09\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6cbf\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u5c42\u4e09\u4e2a\u6b63\u4ea4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u9884\u9009\u62e9\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728GSM8K\u548cCoQA\u4e0a\u68c0\u7d22\u5f00\u9500\u964d\u4f4e\u8d8590%\uff0c\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u8fbeHShare\u76843\u500d\u4e14\u7cbe\u5ea6\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u4f18\uff1bLongBench\u5e73\u5747\u9000\u5316<1%\uff1b\u6ce8\u610f\u529bFLOPs\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u7a00\u758f\u57fa\u7ebf\u4f4e\u7ea615%\uff1bA100 GPU\u4e0a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7b97\u5b50\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e9.9\u500d\uff0c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u53472.8\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "PrHS\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86KV\u7f13\u5b58\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Recent methods exploit explicit binary masks to constrain editing, but hard mask boundaries introduce artifacts and reduce editability. To address these issues, we propose FusionEdit, a training-free image editing framework that achieves precise and controllable edits. First, editing and preserved regions are automatically identified by measuring semantic discrepancies between source and target prompts. To mitigate boundary artifacts, FusionEdit performs distance-aware latent fusion along region boundaries to yield the soft and accurate mask, and employs a total variation loss to enforce smooth transitions, obtaining natural editing results. Second, FusionEdit leverages AdaIN-based modulation within DiT attention layers to perform a statistical attention fusion in the editing region, enhancing editability while preserving global consistency with the source image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FusionEdit significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

In ReLU-based models, the activation pattern induced by a given input determines the piecewise-linear region in which the network behaves affinely. Motivated by this geometry, we investigate whether training exhibits a two-timescale behavior: an early stage with substantial changes in activation patterns and a later stage where weight updates predominantly refine the model within largely stable activation regimes. We first prove a local stability property: outside measure-zero sets of parameters and inputs, sufficiently small parameter perturbations preserve the activation pattern of a fixed input, implying locally affine behavior within activation regions. We then empirically track per-iteration changes in weights and activation patterns across fully-connected and convolutional architectures, as well as Transformer-based models, where activation patterns are recorded in the ReLU feed-forward (MLP/FFN) submodules, using fixed validation subsets. Across the evaluated settings, activation-pattern changes decay 3 times earlier than weight-update magnitudes, showing that late-stage training often proceeds within relatively stable activation regimes.

Accurate classification of these movements requires sensing technologies capable of capturing rapid dynamics without distortion. Event cameras, also known as Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS), provide asynchronous recordings of changes in light intensity, thereby eliminating motion blur inherent in conventional frame-based cameras and offering superior temporal resolution and data efficiency. In this study, we introduce a synthetic dataset generated with Blender to simulate saccades and fixations under controlled conditions. Leveraging Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), we evaluate its robustness by training two architectures and finetuning on real event data. The proposed models achieve up to 0.83 accuracy and maintain consistent performance across varying temporal resolutions, demonstrating stability in eye movement classification. Moreover, the use of SNNs with synthetic event streams yields substantial computational efficiency gains over artificial neural network (ANN) counterparts, underscoring the utility of synthetic data augmentation in advancing event-based vision.

Reducing these artifacts is critical for high-quality imaging. We propose a computationally efficient hybrid deep-learning framework that combines the strengths of 2D and 3D models. First, a 2D U-Net operates on individual slices of undersampled CT volumes to extract feature maps. These slice-wise feature maps are then stacked across the volume and used as input to a 3D decoder, which utilizes contextual information across slices to predict an artifact-free 3D CT volume. The proposed two-stage approach balances the computational efficiency of 2D processing with the volumetric consistency provided by 3D modeling. The results show substantial improvements in inter-slice consistency in coronal and sagittal direction with low computational overhead.

We show that there exists an instance in which the sample size is linear in the dimension, learning is possible, but the Empirical Risk Minimizer is likely to be unique and to overfit. This resolves an open question by Feldman.

Specifically we provide a novel generalization lower bound of $\u03a9\\left(\\sqrt{\u03b7T/m^{1.5}}\\right)$ for Gradient Descent, where $\u03b7$ is the learning rate, $T$ is the horizon and $m$ is the sample size.

Although recent advances have shown that pseudo-labeling strategies can be effective, they often fail in fine-grained scenarios due to subtle inter-class similarities. A critical but underexplored issue is the presence of asymmetric and dynamic class confusion, where visually similar classes are unequally and inconsistently misclassified by the source model. Existing methods typically ignore such confusion patterns, leading to noisy pseudo-labels and poor target discrimination. To address this, we propose CLIP-Guided Alignment(CGA), a novel framework that explicitly models and mitigates class confusion in SFDA. Generally, our method consists of three parts: (1) MCA: detects first directional confusion pairs by analyzing the predictions of the source model in the target domain; (2) MCC: leverages CLIP to construct confusion-aware textual prompts (e.g. a truck that looks like a bus), enabling more context-sensitive pseudo-labeling; and (3) FAM: builds confusion-guided feature banks for both CLIP and the source model and aligns them using contrastive learning to reduce ambiguity in the representation space. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that CGA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SFDA methods, with especially notable gains in confusion-prone and fine-grained scenarios. Our results highlight the importance of explicitly modeling inter-class confusion for effective source-free adaptation.

JoBS allocates a portion of the optimization budget to learn an LLM performance predictor that predicts how promising a training configuration is from a small number of training steps. The remaining budget is used to perform BO entirely with the predictor, effectively amortizing the cost of running full-training runs.

Cognitive studies suggest that humans address such tasks through two mechanisms: cross-view correspondence, which identifies regions across different views that correspond to the same physical locations, and stepwise viewpoint transformation, which composes relative viewpoint changes sequentially. However, existing studies incorporate these mechanisms only partially and often implicitly, without explicit supervision for both. We propose Human-Aware Training for Cross-view correspondence and viewpoint cHange (HATCH), a training framework with two complementary objectives: (1) Patch-Level Spatial Alignment, which encourages patch representations to align across views for spatially corresponding regions, and (2) Action-then-Answer Reasoning, which requires the model to generate explicit viewpoint transition actions before predicting the final answer. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that HATCH consistently outperforms baselines of comparable size by a clear margin and achieves competitive results against much larger models, while preserving single-image reasoning capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faHATCH\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8865\u4e01\u7ea7\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c-\u518d\u56de\u7b54\u63a8\u7406\u4e24\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e0e\u89c6\u89d2\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MLLMs\u5728\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u800c\u4eba\u7c7b\u4f9d\u8d56\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u5bf9\u5e94\u548c\u9010\u6b65\u89c6\u89d2\u53d8\u6362\u4e24\u79cd\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u90e8\u5206\u3001\u9690\u5f0f\u5730\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u663e\u5f0f\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHATCH\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u76ee\u6807\uff1a(1) \u8865\u4e01\u7ea7\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4fc3\u4f7f\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u5e94\u533a\u57df\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b(2) \u52a8\u4f5c-\u518d\u56de\u7b54\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u6a21\u578b\u5148\u751f\u6210\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u53d8\u6362\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u518d\u9884\u6d4b\u7b54\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cHATCH\u6301\u7eed\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u5ab2\u7f8e\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u673a\u5236\uff08\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e0e\u89c6\u89d2\u53d8\u6362\uff09\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347MLLMs\u7684\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0cHATCH\u4e3a\u8be5\u65b9\u5411\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

To address this, we build on the discounted-to-dynamic reduction and present a modular way to obtain dynamic regret bounds of FTRL-related problems. Specifically, we focus on two representative curved losses: linear regression and logistic regression. Our method not only simplifies existing proofs for the optimal dynamic regret of online linear regression, but also yields new dynamic regret guarantees for online logistic regression. Beyond online convex optimization, we apply the reduction to analyze the Adam optimizers, obtaining optimal convergence rates in stochastic, non-convex, and non-smooth settings.

We identify this limitation as a consequence of globally conditioned velocity fields and joint attention mechanisms, which entangle concurrent edits. To address this issue, we introduce Instance-Disentangled Attention, a mechanism that partitions joint attention operations, enforcing binding between instance-specific textual instructions and spatial regions during velocity field estimation.

However, many existing weight-only methods rely on heuristic objectives and greedy rounding, thus leading to noticeable degradation under low-bit quantization. In this work, we introduce OJBKQ (Objective-Joint Babai-Klein Quantization with K-Best Sampling), a layer-wise PTQ method that formulates weight quantization as a joint optimization problem over activations and weights. This formulation results in a multiple-right-hand-side box-constrained integer least squares (BILS) problem in each layer, which is NP-hard. For each column of the weight matrix, we apply an extended Babai nearest-plane algorithm and an extended version of Klein's randomized Babai algorithm to find the minimum-residual Babai-Klein point, a sub-optimal solution to the BILS problem.

However, many recent talking-head generation (THG) methods rely on GPU-centric neural rendering, large training sets, or high-capacity diffusion models, which limits deployment in offline or resource-constrained learning environments. A deterministic and CPU-oriented THG framework is described, termed Symbolic Vedic Computation, that converts speech to a time-aligned phoneme stream, maps phonemes to a compact viseme inventory, and produces smooth viseme trajectories through symbolic coarticulation inspired by Vedic sutra Urdhva Tiryakbhyam. A lightweight 2D renderer performs region-of-interest (ROI) warping and mouth compositing with stabilization to support real-time synthesis on commodity CPUs. Experiments report synchronization accuracy, temporal stability, and identity consistency under CPU-only execution, alongside benchmarking against representative CPU-feasible baselines. Results indicate that acceptable lip-sync quality can be achieved while substantially reducing computational load and latency, supporting practical educational avatars on low-end hardware.

However, electrical arcing at this interface poses serious risks, including accelerated wear of contact components, degraded system performance, and potential service disruptions. Detecting arcing events at the pantograph-catenary interface is challenging due to their transient nature, noisy operating environment, data scarcity, and the difficulty of distinguishing arcs from other similar transient phenomena. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal framework that combines high-resolution image data with force measurements to more accurately and robustly detect arcing events. First, we construct two arcing detection datasets comprising synchronized visual and force measurements. One dataset is built from data provided by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB), and the other is derived from publicly available videos of arcing events in different railway systems and synthetic force data that mimic the characteristics observed in the real dataset. Leveraging these datasets, we propose MultiDeepSAD, an extension of the DeepSAD algorithm for multiple modalities with a new loss formulation. Additionally, we introduce tailored pseudo-anomaly generation techniques specific to each data type, such as synthetic arc-like artifacts in images and simulated force irregularities, to augment training data and improve the discriminative ability of the model. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies, we demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms baseline approaches, exhibiting enhanced sensitivity to real arcing events even under domain shifts and limited availability of real arcing observations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u53d7\u529b\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6846\u67b6\uff08MultiDeepSAD\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u5730\u68c0\u6d4b\u53d7\u7535\u5f13-\u63a5\u89e6\u7f51\u754c\u9762\u7684\u7535\u5f27\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u771f\u5b9e\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ca\u4f2a\u5f02\u5e38\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7535\u5f27\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5177\u6709\u77ac\u6001\u6027\u3001\u73af\u5883\u566a\u58f0\u5927\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u4e0e\u5176\u5b83\u77ac\u6001\u73b0\u8c61\u533a\u5206\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5176\u68c0\u6d4b\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5a01\u80c1\u94c1\u8def\u4f9b\u7535\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e24\u4e2a\u540c\u6b65\u89c6\u89c9-\u529b\u4fe1\u53f7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u6765\u81ea\u745e\u58eb\u8054\u90a6\u94c1\u8defSBB\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e + \u516c\u5f00\u89c6\u9891+\u5408\u6210\u529b\u4fe1\u53f7\uff09\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578bMultiDeepSAD\uff08DeepSAD\u6269\u5c55\uff09\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u9488\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\uff08\u5408\u6210\u7535\u5f27\u4f2a\u5f71\uff09\u548c\u529b\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u6a21\u62df\u5f02\u5e38\u6ce2\u52a8\uff09\u7684\u4e13\u7528\u4f2a\u5f02\u5e38\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0e\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u7535\u5f27\u6837\u672c\u7a00\u5c11\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6846\u67b6\u53ca\u4f2a\u5f02\u5e38\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7535\u5f27\u4e8b\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u94c1\u8def\u8fd0\u7ef4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

We show that any $C^2$ function that is both radial and additively separable must be quadratic, establishing a fundamental obstruction for coordinate-wise power-law models. Motivated by this result, we introduce Radial M\u00fcntz-Sz\u00e1sz Networks (RMN), which represent fields as linear combinations of learnable radial powers $r^\u03bc$, including negative exponents, together with a limit-stable log-primitive for exact $\\log r$ behavior. RMN admits closed-form spatial gradients and Laplacians, enabling physics-informed learning on punctured domains.

We propose a semi-supervised teacher-student framework that combines an uncertainty-aware pseudo-labeling teacher with a progressive, confidence-based curriculum for the student. The teacher produces probabilistic masks and per-pixel uncertainty; unlabeled scans are ranked by image-level confidence and introduced in stages, while a dual-loss objective trains the student to learn from high-confidence regions and unlearn low-confidence ones. Agreement-based refinement further improves pseudo-label quality. On BraTS 2021, validation DSC increased from 0.393 (10% data) to 0.872 (100%), with the largest gains in early stages, demonstrating data efficiency. The teacher reached a validation DSC of 0.922, and the student surpassed the teacher on tumor subregions (e.g., NCR/NET 0.797 and Edema 0.980); notably, the student recovered the Enhancing class (DSC 0.620) where the teacher failed.

Our key idea is to exploit the understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs to produce explicit target captions to interpret user instructions. In this way, the rich contextual representations from the understanding model are directly used to guide the generative process, thereby improving performance on complex and compositional editing. Moreover, a lightweight adapter is developed to inject multimodal conditional tokens into pretrained text-to-video diffusion models, allowing maximum reuse of their powerful generative priors in a parameter-efficient manner. Benefiting from these designs, we scale up Omni-Video 2 to a 14B video diffusion model on meticulously curated training data with quality, supporting high quality text-to-video generation and various video editing tasks such as object removal, addition, background change, complex motion editing, \\emph{etc.} We evaluate the performance of Omni-Video 2 on the FiVE benchmark for fine-grained video editing and the VBench benchmark for text-to-video generation.

Although recent works incorporate structural information, they implicitly condition adaptation on the smoothness priors of sourcetrained GNNs, thereby limiting their generalization to structurally distinct targets. This dependency becomes a critical bottleneck under significant topological shifts, where the source model misinterprets distinct topological patterns unseen in the source domain as noise, rendering pseudo-label-based adaptation unreliable. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Universal Structural Basis Distillation, a framework that shifts the paradigm from adapting a biased model to learning a universal structural basis for SF-GDA. Instead of adapting a biased source model to a specific target, our core idea is to construct a structure-agnostic basis that proactively covers the full spectrum of potential topological patterns. Specifically, USBD employs a bi-level optimization framework to distill the source dataset into a compact structural basis. By enforcing the prototypes to span the full Dirichlet energy spectrum, the learned basis explicitly captures diverse topological motifs, ranging from low-frequency clusters to high-frequency chains, beyond those present in the source. This ensures that the learned basis creates a comprehensive structural covering capable of handling targets with disparate structures. For inference, we introduce a spectral-aware ensemble mechanism that dynamically activates the optimal prototype combination based on the spectral fingerprint of the target graph. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that USBD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios with severe structural shifts, while achieving superior computational efficiency by decoupling the adaptation cost from the target data scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u57fa\u84b8\u998f\uff08USBD\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u901a\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u57fa\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u6e90-\u76ee\u6807\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\u65f6\u7684SF-GDA\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u7ed3\u6784\u56fe\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709SF-GDA\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6e90\u8bad\u7ec3GNN\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u56fe\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u663e\u8457\u62d3\u6251\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u57fa\u84b8\u998f\uff08USBD\uff09\uff1a\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u4ece\u6e90\u56fe\u84b8\u998f\u51fa\u7d27\u51d1\u7ed3\u6784\u57fa\uff1b\u5f3a\u5236\u539f\u578b\u8986\u76d6\u5168Dirichlet\u80fd\u91cf\u8c31\u4ee5\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u591a\u6837\u62d3\u6251\u6a21\u4f53\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u9891\u8c31\u611f\u77e5\u96c6\u6210\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u76ee\u6807\u56fe\u9891\u8c31\u6307\u7eb9\u52a8\u6001\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6700\u4f18\u539f\u578b\u7ec4\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8aSOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7ed3\u6784\u504f\u79fb\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u9002\u914d\u5f00\u9500\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "USBD\u6446\u8131\u4e86\u5bf9\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u8f6c\u800c\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u901a\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u57fa\uff0c\u4e3aSF-GDA\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7ed3\u6784\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Here, we developed a unified foundation model integrating contrastive visual representation learning and vision-language alignment (VLA) to enable any-to-all MRI synthesis. The model uses a contrastive encoder for modality-invariant representations and a CLIP-based text-informed decoder for semantically consistent synthesis, supporting any-to-all MRI synthesis via one unified foundation model. Trained on 40,825 images from 13 institutions, it achieves consistently high performance (average SSIM 0.90, PSNR 27) across 26 internal/external validation sites (15,748 images), with superior synthesis fidelity and robustness to noise and domain shifts.

These devices, typically relying on TinyML models, collaboratively train global models by sharing gradients with a central server while preserving data privacy. However, as data heterogeneity and task complexity increase, TinyML models often become insufficient to capture intricate patterns, especially under extreme non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) conditions. Moreover, ensuring robustness against malicious clients and poisoned updates remains a major challenge. Accordingly, this paper introduces RIFLE - a Robust, distillation-based Federated Learning framework that replaces gradient sharing with logit-based knowledge transfer. By leveraging a knowledge distillation aggregation scheme, RIFLE enables the training of deep models such as VGG-19 and Resnet18 within constrained IoT systems. Furthermore, a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based validation mechanism quantifies the reliability of client updates without exposing raw data, achieving high trust and privacy preservation simultaneously. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100) under heterogeneous non-IID conditions demonstrate that RIFLE reduces false-positive detections by up to 87.5%, enhances poisoning attack mitigation by 62.5%, and achieves up to 28.3% higher accuracy compared to conventional federated learning baselines within only 10 rounds. Notably, RIFLE reduces VGG19 training time from over 600 days to just 1.39 hours on typical IoT devices (0.3 GFLOPS), making deep learning practical in resource-constrained networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faRIFLE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8elogit\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u66ff\u4ee3\u68af\u5ea6\u5171\u4eab\uff0c\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684IoT\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u652f\u6301VGG-19\u7b49\u6df1\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "TinyML\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u4f20\u7edfFL\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff08\u5bf9\u6297\u6076\u610f\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\uff09\u4e0e\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRIFLE\uff1a\u91c7\u7528logit-based\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u66ff\u4ee3\u68af\u5ea6\u5171\u4eab\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1KL\u6563\u5ea6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\u8bc4\u4f30\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u66f4\u65b0\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f7b\u91cf\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728MNIST/CIFAR-10/CIFAR-100\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1a\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u964d\u4f4e87.5%\uff0c\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u7f13\u89e3\u63d0\u534762.5%\uff0c10\u8f6e\u5185\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534728.3%\uff1bVGG-19\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u4ece600\u5929\u538b\u7f29\u81f31.39\u5c0f\u65f6\uff080.3 GFLOPS\u8bbe\u5907\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "RIFLE\u5728\u4fdd\u969c\u9690\u79c1\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u4f7fVGG-19/ResNet18\u7b49\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u5728\u5178\u578bIoT\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u975eIID\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\u4e09\u91cd\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

To mitigate this, we introduce Joint Preference Alignment and Perception Pretext Reinforcement Learning (PPRL). Specifically, rather than directly optimizing for detection task, we adopt general spatiotemporal grounding and self-supervised object counting in the RL stage, enhancing detection performance with simple perception pretext tasks. To facilitate robust evaluation, we further introduce MintVid, a light yet high-quality dataset containing 3K videos from 9 state-of-the-art generators, along with a real-world collected subset that has factual errors in content.

However, current ways of entire-block pruning suffer from risks of discarding meaningful cues learned in those blocks, leading to substantial performance degradation. As another line of model compression, channel pruning can better preserve performance, while it cannot reduce model depth and is challenged by inconsistent pruning ratios for individual layers. To pursue better model compression and acceleration, this paper proposes \\textbf{FlattenGPT}, a novel way to detect and reduce depth-wise redundancies. By flatting two adjacent blocks into one, it compresses the network depth, meanwhile enables more effective parameter redundancy detection and removal. FlattenGPT allows to preserve the knowledge learned in all blocks, and remains consistent with the original transformer architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlattenGPT enhances model efficiency with a decent trade-off to performance.

The vast majority of existing anomaly diagnosis methods offer limited theoretical insights, especially for anomaly localization, which is a vital but largely unexplored area. The aim of this contribution is to study the learning process of a Transformer when applied to MTS by revealing connections to statistical time series methods. Based on these theoretical insights, we propose the Attention Low-Rank Transformer (ALoRa-T) model, which applies low-rank regularization to self-attention, and we introduce the Attention Low-Rank score, effectively capturing the temporal characteristics of anomalies. Finally, to enable anomaly localization, we propose the ALoRa-Loc method, a novel approach that associates anomalies to specific variables by quantifying interrelationships among time series.

However, Video MLLMs face high computational costs, particularly in processing numerous video frames as input, which leads to significant attention computation overhead. A straightforward approach to reduce computational costs is to decrease the number of input video frames. However, simply selecting key frames at a fixed frame rate (FPS) often overlooks valuable information in non-key frames, resulting in notable performance degradation. To address this, we propose Text-guided Video Frame Reduction (TiFRe), a framework that reduces input frames while preserving essential video information. TiFRe uses a Text-guided Frame Sampling (TFS) strategy to select key frames based on user input, which is processed by an LLM to generate a CLIP-style prompt. Pre-trained CLIP encoders calculate the semantic similarity between the prompt and each frame, selecting the most relevant frames as key frames. To preserve video semantics, TiFRe employs a Frame Matching and Merging (FMM) mechanism, which integrates non-key frame information into the selected key frames, minimizing information loss. Experiments show that TiFRe effectively reduces computational costs while improving performance on video-language tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faTiFRe\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5e27\u91c7\u6837\uff08TFS\uff09\u548c\u5e27\u5339\u914d\u878d\u5408\uff08FMM\uff09\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u8f93\u5165\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u6570\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u5173\u952e\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u9891-\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "Video MLLMs\u56e0\u5904\u7406\u5927\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff1b\u56fa\u5b9a\u5e27\u7387\u91c7\u6837\u6613\u4e22\u5931\u975e\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTiFRe\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09Text-guided Frame Sampling\uff08TFS\uff09\u2014\u2014\u5229\u7528LLM\u5c06\u7528\u6237\u8f93\u5165\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3aCLIP\u98ce\u683c\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408CLIP\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e27\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u4ee5\u9009\u62e9\u5173\u952e\u5e27\uff1b2\uff09Frame Matching and Merging\uff08FMM\uff09\u2014\u2014\u5c06\u975e\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5408\u8fdb\u5173\u952e\u5e27\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eTiFRe\u5728\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u95ee\u7b54\u7b49\u89c6\u9891-\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "TiFRe\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316Video MLLMs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

To address this, we define EU as disagreement among models trained with varying relaxations of the i.i.d. assumption between training and test data. Based on this idea, we propose CreDRO, which learns an ensemble of plausible models through distributionally robust optimization. As a result, CreDRO captures EU not only from training randomness but also from meaningful disagreement due to potential distribution shifts between training and test data.

We term these Rendering-Optimal References (RORs) and analyze their statistical properties, revealing stable patterns: mixture-structured scales and bimodal radiance across diverse scenes. To understand what determines these parameters, we apply learnability probes by training predictors to reconstruct RORs from point clouds without rendering supervision. Our analysis uncovers fundamental density-stratification. Dense regions exhibit geometry-correlated parameters amenable to render-free prediction, while sparse regions show systematic failure across architectures. We formalize this through variance decomposition, demonstrating that visibility heterogeneity creates covariance-dominated coupling between geometric and appearance parameters in sparse regions. This reveals the dual character of RORs: geometric primitives where point clouds suffice, and view synthesis primitives where multi-view constraints are essential.

The architecture is deliberately minimal, consisting of one self-attention layer with a single query per prediction and one feedforward layer, resulting in linear computational complexity in sequence length and a small parameter count. Numerical experiments demonstrate that TD-TF matches the performance of strong linear baselines on near-linear systems, while significantly outperforming them in nonlinear and chaotic regimes, where it accurately captures long-term dynamics.

Lindell"], "title": "Grow with the Flow: 4D Reconstruction of Growing Plants with Gaussian Flow Fields", "comment": "Project page: https://weihanluo.ca/growflow/", "summary": "Modeling the time-varying 3D appearance of plants during their growth poses unique challenges: unlike many dynamic scenes, plants generate new geometry over time as they expand, branch, and differentiate. Recent motion modeling techniques are ill-suited to this problem setting. For example, deformation fields cannot introduce new geometry, and 4D Gaussian splatting constrains motion to a linear trajectory in space and time and cannot track the same set of Gaussians over time. Here, we introduce a 3D Gaussian flow field representation that models plant growth as a time-varying derivative over Gaussian parameters -- position, scale, orientation, color, and opacity -- enabling nonlinear and continuous-time growth dynamics. To initialize a sufficient set of Gaussian primitives, we reconstruct the mature plant and learn a process of reverse growth, effectively simulating the plant's developmental history in reverse. Our approach achieves superior image quality and geometric accuracy compared to prior methods on multi-view timelapse datasets of plant growth, providing a new approach for appearance modeling of growing 3D structures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6d41\u573a\u7684\u690d\u7269\u751f\u957f\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u53c2\u6570\u5bfc\u6570\u6765\u8868\u793a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u3001\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u751f\u957f\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u53cd\u5411\u751f\u957f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u9ad8\u65af\u539f\u8bed\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u5ef6\u65f6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u690d\u7269\u5728\u751f\u957f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4e0d\u65ad\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5982\u5206\u679d\u3001\u5206\u5316\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u52a8\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u5f62\u53d8\u573a\u30014D\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u6b64\u7c7b\u62d3\u6251\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8fde\u7eed\u589e\u957f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6d41\u573a\u8868\u793a\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u690d\u7269\u751f\u957f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u9ad8\u65af\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3001\u65b9\u5411\u3001\u989c\u8272\u3001\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff09\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5bfc\u6570\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u5efa\u6210\u719f\u690d\u682a\u5e76\u5b66\u4e60\u53cd\u5411\u751f\u957f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6765\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u8db3\u591f\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u539f\u8bed\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u690d\u7269\u751f\u957f\u5ef6\u65f6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5747\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u751f\u957f\u578b3D\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5916\u89c2\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u52a8\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u6280\u672f\u5728\u62d3\u6251\u6f14\u5316\u4e0e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u53d8\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u3002"}}

The core of our method is a novel joint representation of dense 3D point maps and 3D scene flows in a shared coordinate system, and a novel 4D VAE to effectively learn this representation. Unlike prior work that forces the 3D value and latents to align strictly with RGB VAE latents-despite their fundamentally different distributions-we show that such alignment is unnecessary and leads to suboptimal performance. Instead, we introduce a new data normalization and VAE training strategy that better transfers diffusion priors and greatly improves reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that MotionCrafter achieves state-of-the-art performance in both geometry reconstruction and dense scene flow estimation, delivering 38.64% and 25.0% improvements in geometry and motion reconstruction, respectively, all without any post-optimization.

However, existing RLVR methods utilize rollouts in an indiscriminate and short-horizon manner: responses of heterogeneous quality within each prompt are treated uniformly, and historical rollouts are discarded after a single use. This leads to noisy supervision, poor sample efficiency, and suboptimal policy updates. We address these issues by formulating rollout scheduling in RLVR as a contextual bandit problem and proposing a unified neural scheduling framework that adaptively selects high-value rollouts throughout training. Each rollout is treated as an arm whose reward is defined by the induced performance gain between consecutive optimization steps. The resulting scheduler supports both noise-aware intra-group selection and adaptive global reuse of historical rollouts within a single principled framework. We provide theoretical justification by deriving sublinear regret bounds and showing that enlarging the rollout buffer improves the achievable performance upper bound.

Evidence of Alignment and Decoupling in Heterogeneous GNNs", "comment": null, "summary": "Meta-path-based heterogeneous graph neural networks aggregate over meta-path-induced views, and their semantic-level attention over meta-path channels is widely used as a narrative for ``which semantics matter.'' We study this assumption empirically by asking: when does meta-path attention reflect meta-path importance, and when can it decouple? A key challenge is that most post-hoc GNN explainers are designed for homogeneous graphs, and naive adaptations to heterogeneous neighborhoods can mix semantics and confound perturbations. To enable a controlled empirical analysis, we introduce MetaXplain, a meta-path-aware post-hoc explanation protocol that applies existing explainers in the native meta-path view domain via (i) view-factorized explanations, (ii) schema-valid channel-wise perturbations, and (iii) fusion-aware attribution, without modifying the underlying predictor. We benchmark representative gradient-, perturbation-, and Shapley-style explainers on ACM, DBLP, and IMDB with HAN and HAN-GCN, comparing against xPath and type-matched random baselines under standard faithfulness metrics. To quantify attention reliability, we propose Meta-Path Attention--Explanation Alignment (MP-AEA), which measures rank correlation between learned attention weights and explanation-derived meta-path contribution scores across random runs. Our results show that meta-path-aware explanations typically outperform random controls, while MP-AEA reveals both high-alignment and statistically significant decoupling regimes depending on the dataset and backbone; moreover, retraining on explanation-induced subgraphs often preserves, and in some noisy regimes improves, predictive performance, suggesting an explanation-as-denoising effect.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5143\u8def\u5f84\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u5143\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MetaXplain\u89e3\u91ca\u534f\u8bae\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5143\u8def\u5f84\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5e38\u88ab\u7528\u4f5c\u89e3\u91ca\u2018\u54ea\u4e9b\u8bed\u4e49\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u2019\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u662f\u5426\u771f\u5b9e\u53cd\u6620\u5143\u8def\u5f84\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b\u73b0\u6709GNN\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u591a\u9488\u5bf9\u540c\u6784\u56fe\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u8fc1\u79fb\u81f3\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\u6613\u6df7\u6dc6\u8bed\u4e49\u5e76\u5e72\u6270\u6270\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMetaXplain\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u79cd\u5143\u8def\u5f84\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u89e3\u91ca\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u89c6\u56fe\u5206\u89e3\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u7b26\u5408\u56fe\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u901a\u9053\u7ea7\u6270\u52a8\u3001\u878d\u5408\u611f\u77e5\u5f52\u56e0\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\uff1b\u5728ACM\u3001DBLP\u3001IMDB\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5bf9HAN\u548cHAN-GCN\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u68af\u5ea6/\u6270\u52a8/Shapley\u7c7b\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165MP-AEA\u6307\u6807\u8861\u91cf\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6743\u91cd\u4e0e\u89e3\u91ca\u8d21\u732e\u5206\u6570\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "MetaXplain\u89e3\u91ca\u901a\u5e38\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1bMP-AEA\u63ed\u793a\u51fa\u9ad8\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u663e\u8457\u89e3\u8026\u5e76\u5b58\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u89e3\u91ca\u5b50\u56fe\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u89e3\u91ca\u5177\u6709\u53bb\u566a\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5143\u8def\u5f84\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5e76\u975e\u603b\u662f\u53ef\u9760\u6307\u793a\u5143\u8def\u5f84\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff1b\u9700\u501f\u52a9\u5143\u8def\u5f84\u611f\u77e5\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982MetaXplain\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u89e3\u91ca\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002"}}

Despite its significance in industrial applications such as fraud detection and user segmentation, a significant chasm persists between academic research and real-world deployment. Current evaluation protocols suffer from the small-scale, high-homophily citation datasets, non-scalable full-batch training paradigms, and a reliance on supervised metrics that fail to reflect performance in label-scarce environments. To bridge these gaps, we present PyAGC, a comprehensive, production-ready benchmark and library designed to stress-test AGC methods across diverse scales and structural properties. We unify existing methodologies into a modular Encode-Cluster-Optimize framework and, for the first time, provide memory-efficient, mini-batch implementations for a wide array of state-of-the-art AGC algorithms. Our benchmark curates 12 diverse datasets, ranging from 2.7K to 111M nodes, specifically incorporating industrial graphs with complex tabular features and low homophily. Furthermore, we advocate for a holistic evaluation protocol that mandates unsupervised structural metrics and efficiency profiling alongside traditional supervised metrics. Battle-tested in high-stakes industrial workflows at Ant Group, this benchmark offers the community a robust, reproducible, and scalable platform to advance AGC research towards realistic deployment.

This limitation is evident from the poor generalization to sports unseen during finetuning. Furthermore, traditional text generation evaluation metrics (e.g., BLEU-4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, BERTScore), originally developed for machine translation and summarization, fail to capture the unique aspects of sports feedback quality. To address the first problem, using rock climbing as our case study, we propose using auxiliary freely-available web data from the target domain, such as competition videos and coaching manuals, in addition to existing sports feedback from a disjoint, source domain to improve sports feedback generation performance on the target domain. To improve evaluation, we propose two evaluation metrics: (1) specificity and (2) actionability.

While effective for in-distribution tasks, we argue that these deterministic paths become brittle under causal interventions, which often require transporting probability mass across low-density regions (\"off-manifold\") where the vector field is ill-defined. This leads to numerical instability and spurious correlations. In this work, we introduce the Causal Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge (CSB), a framework that reformulates counterfactual inference as Entropic Optimal Transport. Unlike deterministic approaches that require strict invertibility, CSB leverages diffusion processes (SDEs) to robustly \"tunnel\" through support mismatches while strictly enforcing structural admissibility constraints. We prove the Structural Decomposition Theorem, showing that the global high-dimensional bridge factorizes into local, robust transitions. Empirical validation on high-dimensional interventions (Morpho-MNIST) demonstrates that CSB significantly outperforms deterministic baselines in structural consistency, particularly in regimes of strong, out-of-distribution treatments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u56e0\u679c\u859b\u5b9a\u8c14\u6865\uff08CSB\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u71b5\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u968f\u673a\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08SDE\uff09\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5e38\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08ODE\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u5e72\u9884\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u751f\u6210\u6d41\uff08\u5982ODE\uff09\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\u4e0b\u56e0\u9700\u7a7f\u8d8a\u4f4e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u533a\u57df\uff08off-manifold\uff09\u800c\u51fa\u73b0\u5411\u91cf\u573a\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e0d\u826f\u3001\u6570\u503c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u56e0\u679c\u859b\u5b9a\u8c14\u6865\uff08CSB\uff09\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08SDE\uff09\u5efa\u6a21\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u5e26\u7ed3\u6784\u53ef\u5bb9\u8bb8\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u71b5\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u89e3\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6865\u6881\u53ef\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5c40\u90e8\u7a33\u5065\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u5728Morpho-MNIST\u7b49\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5e72\u9884\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cCSB\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5f3a\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u5904\u7406\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "CSB\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u968f\u673a\u6027\u4e0e\u71b5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6d41\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\u4e2d\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4e3a\u9c81\u68d2\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, existing distillation methods typically approximate the teacher trajectory by using linear shortcuts, which makes it difficult to match its constantly changing tangent directions as velocities evolve across timesteps, thereby leading to quality degradation. To address this limitation, we propose ArcFlow, a few-step distillation framework that explicitly employs non-linear flow trajectories to approximate pre-trained teacher trajectories. Concretely, ArcFlow parameterizes the velocity field underlying the inference trajectory as a mixture of continuous momentum processes. This enables ArcFlow to capture velocity evolution and extrapolate coherent velocities to form a continuous non-linear trajectory within each denoising step. Importantly, this parameterization admits an analytical integration of this non-linear trajectory, which circumvents numerical discretization errors and results in high-precision approximation of the teacher trajectory. To train this parameterization into a few-step generator, we implement ArcFlow via trajectory distillation on pre-trained teacher models using lightweight adapters. This strategy ensures fast, stable convergence while preserving generative diversity and quality. Built on large-scale models (Qwen-Image-20B and FLUX.1-dev), ArcFlow only fine-tunes on less than 5% of original parameters and achieves a 40x speedup with 2 NFEs over the original multi-step teachers without significant quality degradation.

However, existing techniques struggle in faithfully generating the structure and semantics conveyed by complex floorplans that depict large indoor spaces with many rooms and a varying numbers of polygon corners. To this end, we propose Raster2Seq, framing floorplan reconstruction as a sequence-to-sequence task in which floorplan elements--such as rooms, windows, and doors--are represented as labeled polygon sequences that jointly encode geometry and semantics. Our approach introduces an autoregressive decoder that learns to predict the next corner conditioned on image features and previously generated corners using guidance from learnable anchors.

We challenge this assumption by introducing implicit memory-the ability of a model to carry state across otherwise independent interactions by encoding information in its own outputs and later recovering it when those outputs are reintroduced as input. This mechanism does not require any explicit memory module, yet it creates a persistent information channel across inference requests. As a concrete demonstration, we introduce a new class of temporal backdoors, which we call time bombs. Unlike conventional backdoors that activate on a single trigger input, time bombs activate only after a sequence of interactions satisfies hidden conditions accumulated via implicit memory. We show that such behavior can be induced today through straightforward prompting or fine-tuning. Beyond this case study, we analyze broader implications of implicit memory, including covert inter-agent communication, benchmark contamination, targeted manipulation, and training-data poisoning.

Model merging offers a compelling alternative by directly integrating the weights of multiple source models without requiring additional data or extensive training. However, conventional model merging techniques, such as parameter averaging, often suffer from the unintended combination of non-generalizable features, especially when source models exhibit significant weight disparities. Comparatively, model ensembling generally provides more stable and superior performance that aggregates multiple models by averaging outputs. However, it incurs higher inference costs and increased storage requirements. While previous studies experimentally showed the similarities between model merging and ensembling, theoretical evidence and evaluation metrics remain lacking. To address this gap, we introduce Merging-ensembling loss (M-Loss), a novel evaluation metric that quantifies the compatibility of merging source models using very limited unlabeled data. By measuring the discrepancy between parameter averaging and model ensembling at layer and node levels, M-Loss facilitates more effective merging strategies. Specifically, M-Loss serves both as a quantitative criterion of the theoretical feasibility of model merging, and a guide for parameter significance in model pruning. Our theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations demonstrate that incorporating M-Loss into the merging process significantly improves the alignment between merged models and model ensembling, providing a scalable and efficient framework for accurate model consolidation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807M-Loss\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8861\u91cf\u53c2\u6570\u5e73\u5747\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u5728\u5c42\u548c\u8282\u70b9\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u6548\u679c\u5e76\u6307\u5bfc\u526a\u679d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u53c2\u6570\u5e73\u5747\uff09\u6613\u6df7\u5408\u975e\u6cdb\u5316\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5f53\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\u65f6\uff1b\u800c\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u867d\u6027\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff1b\u4e8c\u8005\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5df2\u6709\u5b9e\u9a8c\u89c2\u5bdf\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u548c\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMerging-ensembling loss\uff08M-Loss\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6781\u5c11\u91cf\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u5c42\u548c\u8282\u70b9\u7ea7\u522b\u8861\u91cf\u53c2\u6570\u5e73\u5747\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u7528\u4f5c\u5408\u5e76\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u5224\u636e\u53ca\u53c2\u6570\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6307\u5bfc\uff08\u5982\u526a\u679d\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f15\u5165M-Loss\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5408\u5e76\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "M-Loss\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5177\u5907\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\uff0c bridging merging and ensembling\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u5982\u6a21\u578b\u526a\u679d\u3002"}}

We systematically investigate the performance gap between discrete and continuous methods. Contrary to the belief that discrete tokenizers are intrinsically inferior, we demonstrate that the disparity arises primarily from the total number of bits allocated in the latent space (i.e., the compression ratio). We show that scaling up the codebook size effectively bridges this gap, allowing discrete tokenizers to match or surpass their continuous counterparts. However, existing discrete generation methods struggle to capitalize on this insight, suffering from performance degradation or prohibitive training costs with scaled codebook. To address this, we propose masked Bit AutoRegressive modeling (BAR), a scalable framework that supports arbitrary codebook sizes. By equipping an autoregressive transformer with a masked bit modeling head, BAR predicts discrete tokens through progressively generating their constituent bits. BAR achieves a new state-of-the-art gFID of 0.99 on ImageNet-256, outperforming leading methods across both continuous and discrete paradigms, while significantly reducing sampling costs and converging faster than prior continuous approaches.

However, most existing offline safe RL methods are trained under a pre-specified threshold, yielding policies with limited generalization and deployment flexibility across cost thresholds. Motivated by recent progress in conditional sequence modeling (CSM), which enables flexible goal-conditioned control by specifying target returns, we propose RCDT, a CSM-based method that supports zero-shot deployment across multiple cost thresholds within a single trained policy. RCDT is the first CSM-based offline safe RL algorithm that integrates a Lagrangian-style cost penalty with an auto-adaptive penalty coefficient. To avoid overly conservative behavior and achieve a more favorable return--cost trade-off, a reward--cost-aware trajectory reweighting mechanism and Q-value regularization are further incorporated. Extensive experiments on the DSRL benchmark demonstrate that RCDT consistently improves return--cost trade-offs over representative baselines, advancing the state-of-the-art in offline safe RL.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faRCDT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b89\u5168\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5355\u7b56\u7565\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u9002\u914d\u591a\u79cd\u6210\u672c\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u60e9\u7f5a\u3001\u8f68\u8ff9\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u4e0eQ\u503c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u63d0\u5347\u6536\u76ca-\u6210\u672c\u6743\u8861\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b89\u5168\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u9884\u8bbe\u6210\u672c\u9608\u503c\u4e0b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8de8\u9608\u503c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e0d\u540c\u90e8\u7f72\u573a\u666f\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u9700\u6c42\uff1b\u53d7\u6761\u4ef6\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u6210\u672c\u9608\u503c\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRCDT\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\uff08CSM\uff09\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u6210\u672c\u60e9\u7f5a\u4e0e\u81ea\u52a8\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u60e9\u7f5a\u7cfb\u6570\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5956\u52b1-\u6210\u672c\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u673a\u5236\u548cQ\u503c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4fdd\u5b88\u884c\u4e3a\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u6536\u76ca-\u6210\u672c\u6743\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u5728DSRL\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRCDT\u5728\u5404\u7c7b\u6210\u672c\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u6536\u76ca-\u6210\u672c\u6743\u8861\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b89\u5168\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "RCDT\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5c06\u6761\u4ef6\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u7528\u4e8e\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b89\u5168\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5355\u7b56\u7565\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8de8\u6210\u672c\u9608\u503c\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u9879\u673a\u5236\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Current KV cache eviction methods typically rely on instantaneous heuristic metrics, implicitly assuming that score magnitudes are consistent proxies for importance across all heads. However, this overlooks the heterogeneity in predictive fidelity across attention heads. While certain heads prioritize the instantaneous contribution of tokens, others are dedicated to capturing long-horizon utility. In this paper, we propose that optimal budget allocation should be governed by the marginal utility in preserving long-term semantic information. Based on this insight, we propose LU-KV, a novel framework that optimizes head-level budget allocation through a convex-hull relaxation and a marginal-utility-based greedy solver to achieve near-optimal precision. Furthermore, we implement a data-driven offline profiling protocol to facilitate the practical deployment of LU-KV.

Owing to the increasing importance of algorithmic fairness, we consider the problem of computing PR vectors subject to various group-fairness criteria based on sensitive attributes of the vertices.

In order to overcome these shortcomings, we put forth a unified in-processing convex optimization framework, termed FairRARI, for tackling different group-fairness criteria in a ``plug and play'' fashion. Leveraging a variational formulation of PR, the framework computes fair PR vectors by solving a strongly convex optimization problem with fairness constraints, thereby ensuring that a target fairness level is achieved. We further introduce three different fairness criteria which can be efficiently tackled using FairRARI to compute fair PR vectors with the same asymptotic time-complexity as the original PR algorithm.

Federated prompt learning mitigates this issue by keeping the VLPM backbone frozen and collaboratively training lightweight prompt parameters. However, existing approaches typically enforce a unified prompt structure and length across clients, which is inadequate under practical client heterogeneity in both data distributions and system resources, and may further introduce conflicts between globally shared and locally optimal knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{SDFed}, a heterogeneous federated prompt learning framework that bridges Local-Global Discrepancy via Subspace Refinement and Divergence Control. SDFed maintains a fixed-length global prompt for efficient aggregation while allowing each client to learn a variable-length local prompt to better match its data characteristics and capacity. To mitigate local-global conflicts and facilitate effective knowledge transfer, SDFed introduces a subspace refinement method for local prompts and an information retention and divergence control strategy that preserves key local information while maintaining appropriate separability between global and local representations. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate that SDFed consistently improves performance and robustness in heterogeneous federated settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSDFed\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u53d1\u6563\u63a7\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u5f02\u6784\u8054\u90a6\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u90e8-\u5168\u5c40\u5dee\u5f02\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u53d8\u957f\u5ea6\u672c\u5730\u63d0\u793a\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u5f02\u6784\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u56fa\u5b9a\u957f\u5ea6\u5168\u5c40\u63d0\u793a\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u805a\u5408\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u8d44\u6e90\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u4e0b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u63d0\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u5171\u4eab\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u672c\u5730\u6570\u636e\u5c11\u3002", "method": "SDFed\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\uff1a1\uff09\u56fa\u5b9a\u957f\u5ea6\u5168\u5c40\u63d0\u793a\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u805a\u5408\uff1b2\uff09\u53ef\u53d8\u957f\u5ea6\u672c\u5730\u63d0\u793a\u9002\u914d\u5404\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7279\u6027\uff1b3\uff09\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f13\u89e3\u5c40\u90e8-\u5168\u5c40\u51b2\u7a81\uff1b4\uff09\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0e\u53d1\u6563\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u5e73\u8861\u5c40\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0e\u8868\u5f81\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSDFed\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u8054\u90a6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SDFed\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u5f02\u6784\u8054\u90a6\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5c40\u90e8-\u5168\u5c40\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u9690\u79c1\u654f\u611f\u591a\u53c2\u4e0e\u65b9\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, the existing methods face notable limitations, including limited pre-training scale or heavy reliance on textual information. Motivated by the success of tabular foundation models (TFMs) in achieving universal prediction across diverse tabular datasets, we explore an alternative approach by TFMs, which are pre-trained on diverse synthetic datasets sampled from structural causal models and support strong in-context learning independent of textual attributes. Nevertheless, adapting TFMs for link prediction faces severe technical challenges such as how to obtain the necessary context and capture link-centric topological information. To solve these challenges, we propose TFMLinker (Tabular Foundation Model for Link Predictor), aiming to leverage the in-context learning capabilities of TFMs to perform link prediction across diverse graphs without requiring dataset-specific fine-tuning. Specifically, we first develop a prototype-augmented local-global context module to construct context that captures both graph-specific and cross-graph transferable patterns. Next, we design a universal topology-aware link encoder to capture link-centric topological information and generate link representations as inputs for the TFM. Finally, we employ the TFM to predict link existence through in-context learning.

However, prior work has largely focused on utility and efficiency, leaving the safety risks associated with this sparse architecture underexplored. In this work, we show that the safety of MoE LLMs is as sparse as their architecture by discovering unsafe routes: routing configurations that, once activated, convert safe outputs into harmful ones. Specifically, we first introduce the Router Safety importance score (RoSais) to quantify the safety criticality of each layer's router. Manipulation of only the high-RoSais router(s) can flip the default route into an unsafe one. For instance, on JailbreakBench, masking 5 routers in DeepSeek-V2-Lite increases attack success rate (ASR) by over 4$\\times$ to 0.79, highlighting an inherent risk that router manipulation may naturally occur in MoE LLMs. We further propose a Fine-grained token-layer-wise Stochastic Optimization framework to discover more concrete Unsafe Routes (F-SOUR), which explicitly considers the sequentiality and dynamics of input tokens. Across four representative MoE LLM families, F-SOUR achieves an average ASR of 0.90 and 0.98 on JailbreakBench and AdvBench, respectively. Finally, we outline defensive perspectives, including safety-aware route disabling and router training, as promising directions to safeguard MoE LLMs. We hope our work can inform future red-teaming and safeguarding of MoE LLMs. Our code is provided in https://github.com/TrustAIRLab/UnsafeMoE.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\uff08MoE\uff09\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u2018\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u8def\u7531\u2019\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b0\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u64cd\u7eb5\u9ad8\u5b89\u5168\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5f97\u5206\uff08RoSais\uff09\u7684\u8def\u7531\u5668\uff0c\u53ef\u8f7b\u6613\u5c06\u539f\u672c\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u53d8\u4e3a\u6709\u5bb3\u8f93\u51fa\uff1b\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u968f\u673a\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6F-SOUR\u9ad8\u6548\u53d1\u73b0\u6b64\u7c7b\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u8def\u7531\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe0.98\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u82e5\u5e72\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8eMoE\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5374\u5ffd\u89c6\u5176\u7a00\u758f\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u8def\u7531\u5668\u88ab\u64cd\u7eb5\u540e\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u4ece\u5b89\u5168\u53d8\u4e3a\u6709\u5bb3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRouter Safety\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5f97\u5206\uff08RoSais\uff09\u91cf\u5316\u5404\u5c42\u8def\u7531\u5668\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u6027\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6token-layer-wise\u968f\u673a\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff08F-SOUR\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u8f93\u5165token\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u6027\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u4ee5\u53d1\u73b0\u5177\u4f53\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u8def\u7531\u3002", "result": "\u5728JailbreakBench\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ec5\u5c4f\u853dDeepSeek-V2-Lite\u4e2d5\u4e2a\u9ad8RoSais\u8def\u7531\u5668\u5373\u53ef\u4f7f\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff08ASR\uff09\u8d854\u500d\u63d0\u5347\u81f30.79\uff1bF-SOUR\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41MoE\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e8eJailbreakBench\u548cAdvBench\u5e73\u5747ASR\u5206\u522b\u8fbe0.90\u548c0.98\u3002", "conclusion": "MoE\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u5176\u7a00\u758f\u67b6\u6784\u4e00\u6837\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5929\u7136\u7684\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u8def\u7531\u98ce\u9669\uff1b\u9700\u4ece\u5b89\u5168\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8def\u7531\u7981\u7528\u3001\u8def\u7531\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b49\u89d2\u5ea6\u52a0\u5f3a\u9632\u5fa1\uff0c\u4e3aMoE\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ea2\u961f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u969c\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

To address this challenge, we present CauScale, a neural architecture designed for efficient causal discovery that scales inference to graphs with up to 1000 nodes. CauScale improves time efficiency via a reduction unit that compresses data embeddings and improves space efficiency by adopting tied attention weights to avoid maintaining axis-specific attention maps. To keep high causal discovery accuracy, CauScale adopts a two-stream design: a data stream extracts relational evidence from high-dimensional observations, while a graph stream integrates statistical graph priors and preserves key structural signals. CauScale successfully scales to 500-node graphs during training, where prior work fails due to space limitations. Across testing data with varying graph scales and causal mechanisms, CauScale achieves 99.6% mAP on in-distribution data and 84.4% on out-of-distribution data, while delivering 4-13,000 times inference speedups over prior methods.

A key challenge in unsupervised TSAD is that many anomalies are too subtle to exhibit detectable deviation in any single view (e.g., time domain), and instead manifest as inconsistencies across multiple views like time, frequency, and a mixture of resolutions. However, most cross-view methods rely on feature or score fusion and do not enforce analysis-synthesis consistency, meaning the frequency branch is not required to reconstruct the time signal through an inverse transform, and vice versa. In this paper, we present Learnable Fusion of Tri-view Tokens (LEFT), a unified unsupervised TSAD framework that models anomalies as inconsistencies across complementary representations. LEFT learns feature tokens from three views of the same input time series: frequency-domain tokens that embed periodicity information, time-domain tokens that capture local dynamics, and multi-scale tokens that learns abnormal patterns at varying time series granularities. By learning a set of adaptive Nyquist-constrained spectral filters, the original time series is rescaled into multiple resolutions and then encoded, allowing these multi-scale tokens to complement the extracted frequency- and time-domain information. When generating the fused representation, we introduce a novel objective that reconstructs fine-grained targets from coarser multi-scale structure, and put forward an innovative time-frequency cycle consistency constraint to explicitly regularize cross-view agreement. Experiments on real-world benchmarks show that LEFT yields the best detection accuracy against SOTA baselines, while achieving a 5x reduction on FLOPs and 8x speed-up for training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLEFT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u9891\u7387\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e09\u4e2a\u89c6\u89d2\u7684token\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u95f4-\u9891\u7387\u5faa\u73af\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bb8\u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5f02\u5e38\u8fc7\u4e8e\u7ec6\u5fae\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\uff08\u5982\u65f6\u57df\uff09\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u5bdf\u89c9\uff0c\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\uff08\u65f6\u57df\u3001\u9891\u57df\u3001\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff09\u95f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\uff1b\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5206\u6790-\u5408\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "method": "LEFT\u6846\u67b6\u4ece\u540c\u4e00\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u9891\u57df\uff08\u5468\u671f\u6027\uff09\u3001\u65f6\u57df\uff08\u5c40\u90e8\u52a8\u6001\uff09\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff08\u4e0d\u540c\u7c92\u5ea6\u5f02\u5e38\u6a21\u5f0f\uff09\u4e09\u7c7btoken\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94Nyquist\u7ea6\u675f\u8c31\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u751f\u6210\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u91cd\u5efa\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4-\u9891\u7387\u5faa\u73af\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u4ee5\u5f3a\u5236\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cLEFT\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8d85\u8d8aSOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6FLOPs\u964d\u4f4e5\u500d\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53478\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u6a21\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u8868\u5f81\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u878d\u5408\u4e0e\u5f3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u53ef\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

Test-time latent optimization can unlock substantially better reward-guided generations from pretrained generative models, but it is prone to reward hacking that degrades quality and also too slow for practical use. In this work, we make test-time optimization both efficient and reliable by replacing soft regularization with hard white Gaussian noise constraints enforced via projected gradient ascent. Our method applies a closed-form projection after each update to keep the latent vector explicitly noise-like throughout optimization, preventing the drift that leads to unrealistic artifacts. This enforcement adds minimal cost: the projection matches the $O(N \\log N)$ complexity of standard algorithms such as sorting or FFT and does not practically increase wall-clock time. In experiments, our approach reaches a comparable Aesthetic Score using only 30% of the wall-clock time required by the SOTA regularization-based method, while preventing reward hacking.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5e26\u786c\u6027\u767d\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5956\u52b1\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u9632\u6b62\u5956\u52b1\u4f5c\u5f0a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6f5c\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5956\u52b1\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u6613\u53d1\u751f\u5956\u52b1\u4f5c\u5f0a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e14\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u7528\u95ed\u5f0f\u6295\u5f71\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\u66ff\u4ee3\u8f6f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u95ed\u5f0f\u6295\u5f71\u5f3a\u5236\u6f5c\u5728\u5411\u91cf\u59cb\u7ec8\u4fdd\u6301\u767d\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u7ea6\u675f\u4e3a\u786c\u6027\u566a\u58f0\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u9700SOTA\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd530%\u7684\u58c1\u949f\u65f6\u95f4\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u7f8e\u5b66\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u5956\u52b1\u4f5c\u5f0a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u786c\u6027\u767d\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u8f6f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5956\u52b1\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Methods like CQL offers rigorous conservatism but require tremendous compute power while efficient expectile-based methods like IQL often fail to correct OOD errors on pathological datasets, collapsing to Behavioural Cloning. In this work, we propose Geometric Pessimism, a modular, compute-efficient framework that augments standard IQL with density-based penalty derived from k-nearest-neighbour distances in the state-action embedding space. By pre-computing the penalties applied to each state-action pair our method injects OOD conservatism via reward shaping with a O(1) training overhead. Evaluated on the D4Rl MuJoCo benchmark, our method, Geo-IQL outperforms standard IQL on sensitive and unstable medium-replay tasks by over 18 points, while reducing inter-seed variance by 4x. Furthermore, Geo-IQL does not degrade performance on stable manifolds. Crucially, we validate our algorithm on the MIMIC-III Sepsis critical care dataset. While standard IQL collapses to behaviour cloning, Geo-IQL demonstrates active policy improvement.

However, most existing synthesis strategies focus on maintaining statistical information. Although some studies address prediction performance guarantees, their single-stage synthesis designs make it challenging to balance the privacy requirements that necessitate significant perturbations and the prediction performance that is sensitive to such perturbations. We propose a two-stage synthesis strategy. In the first stage, we introduce a synthesis-then-hybrid strategy, which involves a synthesis operation to generate pure synthetic data, followed by a hybrid operation that fuses the synthetic data with the original data. In the second stage, we present a kernel ridge regression (KRR)-based synthesis strategy, where a KRR model is first trained on the original data and then used to generate synthetic outputs based on the synthetic inputs produced in the first stage. By leveraging the theoretical strengths of KRR and the covariant distribution retention achieved in the first stage, our proposed two-stage synthesis strategy enables a statistics-driven restricted privacy--prediction trade-off and guarantee optimal prediction performance. We validate our approach and demonstrate its characteristics of being statistics-driven and restricted in achieving the privacy--prediction trade-off both theoretically and numerically.

Existing fairness notions for generative models are largely adapted from classification and focus on balancing the probability of generating samples from each sensitive group. We show that such criteria are brittle, as they can be met even when different sensitive groups are modeled with widely varying quality. To address this limitation, we introduce a new fairness definition for generative models, termed as equalized generative treatment (EGT), which requires comparable generation quality across all sensitive groups, with quality measured via a reference f-divergence. We further analyze the trade-offs induced by EGT, demonstrating that enforcing fairness constraints necessarily couples the overall model quality to that of the most challenging group to approximate.

Today, we unveil LLaDA2.1, a paradigm shift designed to transcend this trade-off. By seamlessly weaving Token-to-Token (T2T) editing into the conventional Mask-to-Token (M2T) scheme, we introduce a joint, configurable threshold-decoding scheme. This structural innovation gives rise to two distinct personas: the Speedy Mode (S Mode), which audaciously lowers the M2T threshold to bypass traditional constraints while relying on T2T to refine the output; and the Quality Mode (Q Mode), which leans into conservative thresholds to secure superior benchmark performances with manageable efficiency degrade. Furthering this evolution, underpinned by an expansive context window, we implement the first large-scale Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework specifically tailored for dLLMs, anchored by specialized techniques for stable gradient estimation. This alignment not only sharpens reasoning precision but also elevates instruction-following fidelity, bridging the chasm between diffusion dynamics and complex human intent. We culminate this work by releasing LLaDA2.1-Mini (16B) and LLaDA2.1-Flash (100B). Across 33 rigorous benchmarks, LLaDA2.1 delivers strong task performance and lightning-fast decoding speed. Despite its 100B volume, on coding tasks it attains an astounding 892 TPS on HumanEval+, 801 TPS on BigCodeBench, and 663 TPS on LiveCodeBench.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLaDA2.1\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8054\u5408Token-to-Token\uff08T2T\uff09\u4e0eMask-to-Token\uff08M2T\uff09\u7684\u53ef\u914d\u7f6e\u9608\u503c\u89e3\u7801\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u89e3\u7801\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u9996\u6b21\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08dLLMs\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53d1\u5e0316B\u548c100B\u4e24\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u572833\u9879\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u517c\u987e\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\uff08\u5982HumanEval+\u8fbe892 TPS\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u5757\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982LLaDA2.0\uff09\u4e2d\u89e3\u7801\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u7684\u6839\u672c\u77db\u76fe\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u878d\u5408T2T\u7f16\u8f91\u4e0eM2T\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u53cc\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08Speedy Mode / Quality Mode\uff09\u53ef\u914d\u7f6e\u9608\u503c\u89e3\u7801\u67b6\u6784\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9762\u5411dLLMs\u7684\u9996\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u542b\u7a33\u5b9a\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u572833\u9879\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0SOTA\u6216\u63a5\u8fd1SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff1b100B\u6a21\u578b\u5728HumanEval+\u3001BigCodeBench\u3001LiveCodeBench\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u5230892/801/663 TPS\uff1b\u53d1\u5e03LLaDA2.1-Mini\uff0816B\uff09\u548cLLaDA2.1-Flash\uff08100B\uff09\u4e24\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "LLaDA2.1\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u521b\u65b0\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u5347\u7ea7\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u6253\u7834dLLMs\u4e2d\u901f\u5ea6-\u8d28\u91cf\u6743\u8861\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5411\u5b9e\u7528\u5316\u8fc8\u8fdb\u5173\u952e\u4e00\u6b65\u3002"}}

While recent runtime defenses attempt to disrupt this process via output perturbation, most either require access to model parameters or fail when attackers adapt their tactics. In this paper, we first reveal that even the state-of-the-art plug-and-play defense can be bypassed by adaptive attacks, exposing a critical limitation of existing runtime defenses. We then propose Dashed Line Defense (DLD), a plug-and-play post-processing method specifically designed to withstand adaptive query strategies. By introducing ambiguity in how the observed loss reflects the true adversarial strength of candidate examples, DLD prevents attackers from reliably analyzing and adapting their queries, effectively disrupting the AE generation process.

To address these challenges, we propose CompilerKV, a risk-adaptive and head-aware compression framework that compiles offline experience into reusable decision tables for prefill-only deployment. CompilerKV integrates two key synergistic components: (i) a Head Heterogeneity Table, learned via offline contextual bandits, which assigns head-specific reliability weights to govern functional differences across attention heads explicitly; and (ii) a Risk-Adaptive Threshold Gating mechanism that jointly models attention entropy and local perplexity, transforming prompt-level risk into deployable retention thresholds.

While training the denoiser on real-world data is computationally demanding, the sampling procedure itself is more flexible. This adaptability serves as a key lever in practice, enabling improvements in both the quality of generated samples and the efficiency of the sampling process. In this work, we introduce an inverse reinforcement learning framework for learning sampling strategies without retraining the denoiser. We formulate the diffusion sampling procedure as a discrete-time finite-horizon Markov Decision Process, where actions correspond to optional modifications of the sampling dynamics. To optimize action scheduling, we avoid defining an explicit reward function. Instead, we directly match the target behavior expected from the sampler using policy gradient techniques. We provide experimental evidence that this approach can improve the quality of samples generated by pretrained diffusion models and automatically tune sampling hyperparameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9006\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u4e0d\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u53bb\u566a\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u4f18\u5316\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u5339\u914d\u76ee\u6807\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u4e0e\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u81ea\u52a8\u8c03\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7075\u6d3b\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff1b\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u91c7\u6837\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u57df\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u52a8\u4f5c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u5bf9\u91c7\u6837\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u53ef\u9009\u4fee\u6539\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u9006\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4e0d\u663e\u5f0f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u76f4\u63a5\u62df\u5408\u671f\u671b\u91c7\u6837\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6837\u672c\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u91c7\u6837\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u5982\u6b65\u6570\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u8c03\u5ea6\uff09\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9006\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u6709\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91c7\u6837\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002"}}

In this paper, we identify and systematize 11 methodological pitfalls that frequently occur in DRL for cybersecurity (DRL4Sec) literature across the stages of environment modeling, agent training, performance evaluation, and system deployment. By analyzing 66 significant DRL4Sec papers (2018-2025), we quantify the prevalence of each pitfall and find an average of over five pitfalls per paper. We demonstrate the practical impact of these pitfalls using controlled experiments in (i) autonomous cyber defense, (ii) adversarial malware creation, and (iii) web security testing environments.

We introduce an active probabilistic reasoning task that cleanly separates sampling (actively acquiring evidence) from inference (integrating evidence toward a decision). Benchmarking humans and a broad set of contemporary large language models against near-optimal reference policies reveals a consistent pattern: extended reasoning is the key determinant of strong performance, driving large gains in inference and producing belief trajectories that become strikingly human-like, while yielding only modest improvements in active sampling. To explain these differences, we fit a mechanistic model that captures systematic deviations from optimal behavior via four interpretable latent variables: memory, strategy, choice bias, and occlusion awareness. This model places humans and models in a shared low-dimensional cognitive space, reproduces behavioral signatures across agents, and shows how chain-of-thought shifts language models toward human-like regimes of evidence accumulation and belief-to-choice mapping, tightening alignment in inference while leaving a persistent gap in information acquisition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\uff08CoT\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u91c7\u6837\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0CoT\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u4f7f\u4fe1\u5ff5\u8f68\u8ff9\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e3b\u52a8\u91c7\u6837\u6539\u5584\u6709\u9650\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3001\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u906e\u853d\u610f\u8bc6\u56db\u4e2a\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u673a\u5236\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u7f6e\u4e8e\u5171\u4eab\u8ba4\u77e5\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793aCoT\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\u4f46\u672a\u7f29\u5c0f\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u50cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e00\u6837\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u505a\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\uff08CoT\uff09\u5728\u5176\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u4e3b\u52a8\u6982\u7387\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5c06\u8bc1\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\uff08\u91c7\u6837\uff09\u4e0e\u8bc1\u636e\u6574\u5408\uff08\u63a8\u7406\uff09\u89e3\u8026\uff1b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e\u591a\u79cd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u57fa\u51c6\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u542b\u56db\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\uff08\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3001\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u906e\u853d\u610f\u8bc6\uff09\u7684\u673a\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u523b\u753b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u79bb\u6700\u4f18\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6269\u5c55\u63a8\u7406\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662fCoT\uff09\u662f\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u4f7f\u4fe1\u5ff5\u6f14\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7c7b\u4eba\uff0c\u4f46\u4ec5\u5c0f\u5e45\u6539\u5584\u4e3b\u52a8\u91c7\u6837\uff1b\u673a\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u5171\u4eab\u4f4e\u7ef4\u8ba4\u77e5\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u590d\u73b0\u8de8\u4e3b\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u793aCoT\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bc1\u636e\u7d2f\u79ef\u4e0e\u4fe1\u5ff5\u2014\u9009\u62e9\u6620\u5c04\u4e0a\u66f4\u8d8b\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\uff0c\u800c\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\u4ecd\u5b58\u660e\u663e\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u4e3b\u8981\u589e\u5f3a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\u800c\u975e\u91c7\u6837\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u2018\u63a8\u7406\u7c7b\u4eba\u3001\u91c7\u6837\u6b20\u4f73\u2019\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u7c7b\u4eba\u51b3\u7b56\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u5c40\u9650\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Accepted at ICLR 2026", "summary": "Noise is ubiquitous in data used to train large language models, but it is not well understood whether these models are able to correctly generalize to inputs generated without noise. Here, we study noise-robust learning: are transformers trained on data with noisy features able to find a target function that correctly predicts labels for noiseless features? We show that transformers succeed at noise-robust learning for a selection of $k$-sparse parity and majority functions, compared to LSTMs which fail at this task for even modest feature noise. However, we find that transformers typically fail at noise-robust learning of random $k$-juntas, especially when the boolean sensitivity of the optimal solution is smaller than that of the target function. We argue that this failure is due to a combination of two factors: transformers' bias toward simpler functions, combined with an observation that the optimal function for noise-robust learning typically has lower sensitivity than the target function for random boolean functions. We test this hypothesis by exploiting transformers' simplicity bias to trap them in an incorrect solution, but show that transformers can escape this trap by training with an additional loss term penalizing high-sensitivity solutions. Overall, we find that transformers are particularly ineffective for learning boolean functions in the presence of feature noise.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u566a\u58f0\u5b58\u5728\u4e0b\uff0cTransformer\u548cLSTM\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5426\u5b9e\u73b0\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u5373\u5728\u542b\u566a\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u4ecd\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u65e0\u566a\u8f93\u5165\uff09\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTransformer\u5728k-\u7a00\u758f\u5947\u5076\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6570\u51fd\u6570\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u968f\u673ak-junta\u51fd\u6570\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5f53\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5e03\u5c14\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u9ad8\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u65f6\uff1b\u5931\u8d25\u539f\u56e0\u5728\u4e8eTransformer\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u51fd\u6570\u4e14\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u901a\u5e38\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u66f4\u4f4e\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0\u60e9\u7f5a\u9ad8\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u89e3\u7684\u635f\u5931\u9879\u53ef\u6539\u5584\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u566a\u58f0\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5426\u5728\u542b\u566a\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u4ecd\u6b63\u786e\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u65e0\u566a\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5373\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u5f85\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u542b\u7279\u5f81\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3Transformer\u548cLSTM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u65e0\u566a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u5e03\u5c14\u51fd\u6570\uff08k-\u7a00\u758f\u5947\u5076\u6027\u3001\u591a\u6570\u51fd\u6570\u3001\u968f\u673ak-junta\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff1b\u63a2\u7a76\u5e03\u5c14\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u597d\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u60e9\u7f5a\u635f\u5931\u9879\u8fdb\u884c\u5e72\u9884\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "Transformer\u5728k-\u7a00\u758f\u5947\u5076\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6570\u51fd\u6570\u4e0a\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u800cLSTM\u5931\u8d25\uff1b\u4f46\u5728\u968f\u673ak-junta\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0aTransformer\u666e\u904d\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5f53\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u5e03\u5c14\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u9ad8\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u65f6\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u60e9\u7f5a\u635f\u5931\u53ef\u5e2e\u52a9Transformer\u9003\u79bb\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u4f4e\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "Transformer\u867d\u5177\u4e00\u5b9a\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u542b\u566a\u5e03\u5c14\u51fd\u6570\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u672c\u8d28\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5176\u5bf9\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6/\u4f4e\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u4f1a\u963b\u788d\u5bf9\u9ad8\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u52a0\u4ee5\u4fee\u6b63\u3002"}}

By prioritizing these low cosine similarity queries, the behavior of full attention during the prefill stage can be closely approximated. QUOKA leverages this observation, accelerating attention by (1) first retaining a small set of representative queries and (2) then subselectin the keys most aligned with those queries.

Sanchez"], "title": "Foundation Inference Models for Ordinary Differential Equations", "comment": null, "summary": "Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are central to scientific modelling, but inferring their vector fields from noisy trajectories remains challenging. Current approaches such as symbolic regression, Gaussian process (GP) regression, and Neural ODEs often require complex training pipelines and substantial machine learning expertise, or they depend strongly on system-specific prior knowledge. We propose FIM-ODE, a pretrained Foundation Inference Model that amortises low-dimensional ODE inference by predicting the vector field directly from noisy trajectory data in a single forward pass. We pretrain FIM-ODE on a prior distribution over ODEs with low-degree polynomial vector fields and represent the target field with neural operators. FIM-ODE achieves strong zero-shot performance, matching and often improving upon ODEFormer, a recent pretrained symbolic baseline, across a range of regimes despite using a simpler pretraining prior distribution.

Graph Neural Networks have emerged as the main architecture for SAT solving, due to the natural graph representation of Boolean formulas. We analyze the expressive power of GNNs for SAT solving through the lens of the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) test. As our main result, we prove that the full WL hierarchy cannot, in general, distinguish between satisfiable and unsatisfiable instances. We show that indistinguishability under higher-order WL carries over to practical limitations for WL-bounded solvers that set variables sequentially. We further study the expressivity required for several important families of SAT instances, including regular, random and planar instances. To quantify expressivity needs in practice, we conduct experiments on random instances from the G4SAT benchmark and industrial instances from the International SAT Competition. Our results suggest that while random instances are largely distinguishable, industrial instances often require more expressivity to predict a satisfying assignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7Weisfeiler-Leman\uff08WL\uff09\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5206\u6790\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GNN\uff09\u5728\u5e03\u5c14\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u6027\uff08SAT\uff09\u6c42\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eWL\u5c42\u7ea7\u65e0\u6cd5\u666e\u904d\u533a\u5206\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e0e\u4e0d\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u5176\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u987a\u5e8f\u8d4b\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u968f\u673aSAT\u5b9e\u4f8b\u8f83\u6613\u533a\u5206\uff0c\u800c\u5de5\u4e1a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662fGNN\uff09\u66ff\u4ee3\u624b\u5de5\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3SAT\u95ee\u9898\u65e5\u76ca\u6d41\u884c\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u8fb9\u754c\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u6670\uff0c\u9700\u4ece\u56fe\u540c\u6784\u5224\u522b\u89d2\u5ea6\uff08\u5982WL\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790GNN\u80fd\u5426\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206SAT\u5173\u952e\u8bed\u4e49\uff08\u5982\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u6027\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eWeisfeiler-Leman\uff08WL\uff09\u56fe\u540c\u6784\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660eWL\u5404\u9636\u65e0\u6cd5\u4e00\u822c\u6027\u533a\u5206SAT\u7684\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3/\u4e0d\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff1b\u63a8\u5bfc\u8be5\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u987a\u5e8f\u53d8\u91cf\u8d4b\u503c\u7c7bWL\u6709\u754c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u6b63\u5219\u3001\u968f\u673a\u3001\u5e73\u9762\u7b49\u5178\u578bSAT\u65cf\u53caG4SAT\u968f\u673a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0e\u56fd\u9645SAT\u7ade\u8d5b\u5de5\u4e1a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5f00\u5c55\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "1) WL\u5c42\u7ea7\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u65e0\u6cd5\u666e\u904d\u533a\u5206\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e0e\u4e0d\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3SAT\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff1b2) \u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u5c40\u9650\u5bfc\u81f4WL\u6709\u754c\u987a\u5e8f\u8d4b\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u6709\u5931\u8d25\u6848\u4f8b\uff1b3) \u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u968f\u673aSAT\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5728WL\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u5927\u591a\u53ef\u533a\u5206\uff0c\u800c\u5de5\u4e1a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5e38\u9700\u8d85\u8d8aWL\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u624d\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u6ee1\u8db3\u8d4b\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "GNN\u7528\u4e8eSAT\u6c42\u89e3\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u74f6\u9888\uff08\u6e90\u4e8eWL\u5c40\u9650\uff09\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u96be\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\u5de5\u4e1aSAT\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6240\u9700\u7684\u590d\u6742\u903b\u8f91\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u672a\u6765\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u7a81\u7834WL\u8868\u8fbe\u8303\u7574\uff08\u5982\u5f15\u5165\u903b\u8f91\u611f\u77e5\u6216\u9ad8\u9636\u4ea4\u4e92\u673a\u5236\uff09\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Focusing on the context of human activity recognition, we propose RALIS, a model that combines multiview contrastive learning with a mixture-of-experts module to support arbitrary view availability during both training and inference. Instead of trying to reconstruct missing views, an adjusted center contrastive loss is used for self-supervised representation learning and view alignment, mitigating the impact of missing views on multiview fusion. This loss formulation allows for the integration of view weights to account for view quality. Additionally, it reduces computational complexity from $O(V^2)$ to $O(V)$, where $V$ is the number of views. To address residual discrepancies not captured by contrastive learning, we employ a mixture-of-experts module with a specialized load balancing strategy, tasked with adapting to arbitrary view combinations.

However, training GNNs without protection may leak sensitive personal information in graph data, including links and node features. Local differential privacy (LDP) is an advanced technique for protecting data privacy in decentralized networks. Unfortunately, existing local differentially private GNNs either only preserve link privacy or suffer significant utility loss in the process of preserving link and node feature privacy. In this paper, we propose an effective LDP framework, called HoGS, which trains GNNs with link and feature protection by generating a synthetic graph. Concretely, HoGS first collects the link and feature information of the graph under LDP, and then utilizes the phenomenon of homophily in graph data to reconstruct the graph structure and node features separately, thereby effectively mitigating the negative impact of LDP on the downstream GNN training. We theoretically analyze the privacy guarantee of HoGS and conduct experiments using the generated synthetic graph as input to various state-of-the-art GNN architectures. Experimental results on three real-world datasets show that HoGS significantly outperforms baseline methods in the accuracy of training GNNs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aHoGS\u7684\u672c\u5730\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\uff08LDP\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u6765\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u62a4\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u94fe\u63a5\u548c\u8282\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u7684\u540c\u8d28\u6027\u5206\u522b\u91cd\u5efa\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u8282\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4fdd\u969c\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347GNN\u8bad\u7ec3\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u672c\u5730\u5dee\u5206\u79c1\u6709GNN\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u4ec5\u4fdd\u62a4\u94fe\u63a5\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u5728\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u62a4\u94fe\u63a5\u548c\u8282\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\u65f6\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u6548\u7528\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u517c\u987e\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "HoGS\u6846\u67b6\u9996\u5148\u5728LDP\u4e0b\u6536\u96c6\u56fe\u7684\u94fe\u63a5\u548c\u8282\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u7684\u540c\u8d28\u6027\u73b0\u8c61\u5206\u522b\u91cd\u5efa\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8282\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u7528\u4e8e\u540e\u7eedGNN\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHoGS\u5728GNN\u8bad\u7ec3\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "HoGS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684LDP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u5f3a\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u969c\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301GNN\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u94fe\u63a5\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u8054\u5408\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0b\u7684\u6548\u7528\u4e0b\u964d\u96be\u9898\u3002"}}

While most BO pipelines begin with uniform random initialization, default hyperparameter values shipped with popular ML libraries such as scikit-learn encode implicit expert knowledge and could serve as informative starting points that accelerate convergence. This hypothesis, despite its intuitive appeal, has remained largely unexamined. We formalize the idea by initializing BO with points drawn from truncated Gaussian distributions centered at library defaults and compare the resulting trajectories against a uniform-random baseline. We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation spanning three BO back-ends (BoTorch, Optuna, Scikit-Optimize), three model families (Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, Multilayer Perceptrons), and five benchmark datasets covering classification and regression tasks. Performance is assessed through convergence speed and final predictive quality, and statistical significance is determined via one-sided binomial tests. Across all conditions, default-informed initialization yields no statistically significant advantage over purely random sampling, with p-values ranging from 0.141 to 0.908. A sensitivity analysis on the prior variance confirms that, while tighter concentration around the defaults improves early evaluations, this transient benefit vanishes as optimization progresses, leaving final performance unchanged. Our results provide no evidence that default hyperparameters encode useful directional information for optimization. We therefore recommend that practitioners treat hyperparameter tuning as an integral part of model development and favor principled, data-driven search strategies over heuristic reliance on library defaults.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\uff08BO\uff09\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5e93\u9ed8\u8ba4\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u52a0\u901f\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u9ed8\u8ba4\u503c\u5e76\u672a\u5e26\u6765\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3b\u6d41\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u901a\u5e38\u4ee5\u5747\u5300\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff0c\u4f46scikit-learn\u7b49\u5e93\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u9ed8\u8ba4\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u9690\u542b\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u66f4\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u7684\u8d77\u70b9\uff1b\u8be5\u5047\u8bbe\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u7cfb\u7edf\u68c0\u9a8c\u3002", "method": "\u4ee5\u622a\u65ad\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\uff08\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e3a\u5e93\u9ed8\u8ba4\u503c\uff09\u751f\u6210\u521d\u59cb\u70b9\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5747\u5300\u968f\u673a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff1b\u5728BoTorch\u3001Optuna\u3001Scikit-Optimize\u4e09\u4e2aBO\u540e\u7aef\uff0cRF/SVM/MLP\u4e09\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e94\u4e2a\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0e\u56de\u5f52\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u5355\u4fa7\u4e8c\u9879\u68c0\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u5c55\u5148\u9a8c\u65b9\u5dee\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6240\u6709\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ed8\u8ba4\u503c\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5747\u672a\u4ea7\u751f\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff08p\u503c0.141\u20130.908\uff09\uff1b\u867d\u5c0f\u65b9\u5dee\u5148\u9a8c\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u7565\u6709\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u80fd\u65e0\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ed8\u8ba4\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4e0d\u5305\u542b\u5bf9\u4f18\u5316\u6709\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u6307\u5bfc\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u5efa\u8bae\u5c06\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u89c6\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u73af\u8282\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u91c7\u7528\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e93\u9ed8\u8ba4\u503c\u3002"}}

Such analyses are of two varieties: 1) when the metric space includes graphs of unbounded sizes, the theory is only appropriate for dense graphs, and, 2) when studying sparse graphs, the metric space only includes graphs of uniformly bounded size. In this work, we present a unified approach, defining a compact metric on the space of graphs of all sizes, both sparse and dense, under which MPNNs are H\u00f6lder continuous. This leads to more powerful universal approximation theorems and generalization bounds than previous works. The theory is based on, and extends, a recent approach to graph limit theory called graphop analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u4efb\u610f\u5927\u5c0f\uff08\u7a00\u758f\u4e0e\u7a20\u5bc6\uff09\u56fe\u7684\u7d27\u81f4\u5ea6\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5728\u8be5\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0b\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08MPNNs\uff09\u6ee1\u8db3H\u00f6lder\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u903c\u8fd1\u5b9a\u7406\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MPNN\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u903c\u8fd1\u80fd\u529b\u5206\u6790\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u56fe\u89c4\u6a21\uff08\u8981\u4e48\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7a20\u5bc6\u56fe\u4e14\u56fe\u5927\u5c0f\u65e0\u754c\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u5927\u5c0f\u6709\u754c\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u56fe\uff09\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u56fe\u6781\u9650\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684graphop\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e00\u4e2a\u6db5\u76d6\u6240\u6709\u5927\u5c0f\u56fe\uff08\u7a00\u758f\u4e0e\u7a20\u5bc6\uff09\u7684\u7d27\u81f4\u5ea6\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660eMPNN\u5728\u6b64\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0b\u5177\u6709H\u00f6lder\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u6bd4\u4ee5\u5f80\u5de5\u4f5c\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u901a\u7528\u903c\u8fd1\u5b9a\u7406\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7edf\u4e00\u5ea6\u91cf\u6846\u67b6\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u5148\u524d\u7406\u8bba\u5bf9\u56fe\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e0e\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e3aMPNN\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u666e\u9002\u3001\u66f4\u6709\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Yet, measuring and improving procedural validity at scale on real-world tasks remains challenging and understudied. To address this, we introduce How2Everything, a scalable framework to evaluate and improve goal-conditioned procedure generation. Our framework includes How2Mine, which mines 351K procedures from 980K web pages across 14 topics and readily scales to larger corpora. From this pool we build How2Bench, a 7K-example evaluation set balanced across topics. To reliably score model outputs, we develop How2Score, an evaluation protocol that uses an LLM judge to detect whether a generation contains any critical failure that would prevent achieving the goal. For low-cost, reproducible evaluation, we distill a frontier model into an open 8B model, achieving 80.5% agreement with human annotators. How2Bench reveals clear scaling trends across model sizes and training stages, providing signal early in pretraining. Finally, RL using How2Score as a reward improves performance on How2Bench by >10 points across three models without systematic regressions on standard benchmarks, with gains robust to superficial source-document memorization or format compliance. Taken together, How2Everything shows how pretraining web data can support a closed loop of capability evaluation and improvement at scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86How2Everything\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u9762\u5411\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u6b65\u9aa4\u5316\u7a0b\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6570\u636e\u6316\u6398\uff08How2Mine\uff09\u3001\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\uff08How2Bench\uff09\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bc4\u5206\u534f\u8bae\uff08How2Score\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u6b65\u9aa4\u5316\u201c\u5982\u4f55\u505a\u201d\u7a0b\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u95ed\u73af\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaHow2Everything\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09How2Mine\u4ece\u7f51\u9875\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u6316\u6398\u5927\u91cf\u591a\u4e3b\u9898\u6b65\u9aa4\u5316\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff1b2\uff09How2Bench\u6784\u5efa\u5e73\u8861\u3001\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u76847K\u8bc4\u6d4b\u96c6\uff1b3\uff09How2Score\u5229\u7528LLM\u88c1\u5224\u68c0\u6d4b\u5173\u952e\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u5e76\u84b8\u998f\u4e3a8B\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bc4\u5206\uff1b4\uff09\u4ee5How2Score\u4e3a\u5956\u52b1\u8fdb\u884cRL\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "How2Bench\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u5bf9\u7a0b\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6e05\u6670\u7f29\u653e\u89c4\u5f8b\uff1bRL\u4f18\u5316\u4f7f\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5728How2Bench\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u8d8510\u5206\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u635f\u5bb3\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u9c81\u68d2\u4e8e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6216\u683c\u5f0f\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "How2Everything\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u95ed\u73af\u5f0f\u7a0b\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u3002"}}

Yet even small downstream updates can compromise earlier learned behaviors (e.g., safety), exposing a brittleness known as catastrophic forgetting. This suggests standard RLHF objectives do not guarantee robustness to future adaptation. To address it, most prior work designs downstream-time methods to preserve previously learned behaviors. We argue that preventing this requires pre-finetuning robustness: the base policy should avoid brittle high-reward solutions whose reward drops sharply under standard fine-tuning.\n  We propose Fine-tuning Robust Policy Optimization (FRPO), a robust RLHF framework that optimizes reward not only at the current policy, but across a KL-bounded neighborhood of policies reachable by downstream adaptation. The key idea is to ensure reward stability under policy shifts via a max-min formulation. By modifying GRPO, we develop an algorithm with no extra computation, and empirically show it substantially reduces safety degradation across multiple base models and downstream fine-tuning regimes (SFT and RL) while preserving downstream task performance. We further study a math-focused RL setting, demonstrating that FRPO preserves accuracy under subsequent fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFine-tuning Robust Policy Optimization (FRPO)\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u589e\u5f3aRLHF\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u540e\u7eed\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728KL\u7ea6\u675f\u90bb\u57df\u5185\u4f18\u5316\u5956\u52b1\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6RLHF\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u5fae\u8c03\u65f6\u6613\u53d1\u751f\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff08\u5982\u5b89\u5168\u884c\u4e3a\u9000\u5316\uff09\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u7b56\u7565\u672c\u8eab\u5b58\u5728\u8106\u6027\uff1b\u9700\u4ece\u9884\u5fae\u8c03\u9636\u6bb5\u5373\u63d0\u5347\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u540e\u7eed\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0b\u6e38\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFRPO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528max-min\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5728\u5f53\u524d\u7b56\u7565\u7684KL\u7ea6\u675f\u90bb\u57df\u5185\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6700\u5c0f\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u53ef\u5fae\u8c03\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u4fdd\u6301\u5956\u52b1\u7a33\u5b9a\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8eGRPO\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u989d\u5916\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u5f0f\uff08SFT\u4e0eRL\uff09\u4e0b\uff0cFRPO\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406RL\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4e5f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9884\u5fae\u8c03\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff1bFRPO\u901a\u8fc7\u5956\u52b1\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u6f14\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Failure to meet these conditions can place reuse outside the scope of the license, effectively leaving AI artifacts under default copyright for those uses and exposing downstream users to litigation. We call this phenomenon ``permissive washing'': labeling AI artifacts as free to use, while omitting the legal documentation required to make that label actionable. To assess how widespread permissive washing is in the AI supply chain, we empirically audit 124,278 dataset $\\rightarrow$ model $\\rightarrow$ application supply chains, spanning 3,338 datasets, 6,664 models, and 28,516 applications across Hugging Face and GitHub.

Conversely, spiking neural networks (SNNs) exhibit exceptional energy efficiency due to their binary and event-driven characteristics, thus motivating the study of ANN-to-SNN conversion. In this process, quantization plays a pivotal role, mapping LLMs' floating-point parameters to discrete SNN parameters via the temporal dimension of the time window. However, several challenges remain in the conversion process: (i) converting high bit-width quantization values into binary spikes requires longer time windows, increasing system latency; and (ii) the inherent trade-off between the information loss of single-spike schemes and the energy costs of multi-spike ones in SNN. To address these challenges, we propose Kirin, a integer and spike hybrid based SNN to achieve accuracy lossless ANN-to-SNN conversion with time and energy efficiency. Specifically, we first propose a Spike Matrix Hybridization strategy that encoding low bit-width parameters that leading to small time window size into binary spikes while preserving the rest in integer format, thereby reducing the overall latency of SNN execution. Second, we introduce a silence threshold mechanism to regulate the timing of single-spike firing, ensuring the output is mathematically equivalent to the LLM's output and preserves accuracy.

However, we hypothesize that full-sized experts may not be necessary for all domains and that instead low-rank adapters may be sufficient. Here, we introduce FlexMoRE, a Flexible Mixture of Rank-heterogenous Experts, which may be either full-sized experts or adapters of a suitable rank. We systematically investigate the trade-off between expert rank and downstream task performance by evaluating $6$ experts with ranks $2^0$ to $2^{14}$ resulting in experiments covering 150 mixtures (96 with 2 experts, 54 with 7 experts) that are evaluated across $120$ tasks. For our experiments, we build on FlexOlmo and turn its pre-trained experts into low-rank versions. Our regression analysis from expert rank to downstream task performance reveals that the best-performing rank is substantially higher for reasoning-heavy benchmarks than for knowledge-heavy benchmarks. These findings on rank sensitivity come with direct implications for memory efficiency: Using optimal ranks, FlexMoRE yields improved downstream task performance (average score $47.18$) compared to the baseline FlexOlmo-style mixture of full-sized experts (average score $45.46$) at less than one third the parameters ($10.75$B for FlexMoRE vs. $33.27$B for FlexOlmo).

Beyond the algorithm, Dr. MAS provides an end-to-end RL training framework for multi-agent LLM systems, supporting scalable orchestration, flexible per-agent LLM serving and optimization configs, and shared resource scheduling of LLM actor backends.

In this work, we focus on a prevalent yet under-explored phenomenon in graph generalization, Minimal Shift Flip (MSF),where test samples that slightly deviate from the training distribution are abruptly misclassified. To interpret this phenomenon, we revisit MSF through the lens of Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), which characterizes the local stability and sharpness of the loss landscape while providing a theoretical foundation for modeling generalization error. To quantify loss sharpness, we introduce the concept of Local Robust Radius, measuring the smallest perturbation required to flip a prediction and establishing a theoretical link between local stability and generalization. Building on this perspective, we further observe a continual decrease in the robust radius during training, indicating weakened local stability and an increasingly sharp loss landscape that gives rise to MSF. To jointly solve the MSF phenomenon and the intractability of radius, we develop an energy-based formulation that is theoretically proven to be monotonically correlated with the robust radius, offering a tractable and principled objective for modeling flatness and stability. Building on these insights, we propose an energy-driven generative augmentation framework (E2A) that leverages energy-guided latent perturbations to generate pseudo-OOD samples and enhance model generalization. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that E2A consistently improves graph OOD generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u80fd\u91cf\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6E2A\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\uff08OOD\uff09\u6cdb\u5316\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u504f\u79fb\u7ffb\u8f6c\uff08MSF\uff09\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5c40\u90e8\u9c81\u68d2\u534a\u5f84\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\u5efa\u6a21\u635f\u5931\u5e73\u5766\u6027\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GNNs\uff09\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u504f\u79fb\u7ffb\u8f6c\uff08MSF\uff09\u73b0\u8c61\u2014\u2014\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6837\u672c\u4ec5\u8f7b\u5fae\u504f\u79bb\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u5373\u88ab\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "method": "\u4eceSharpness-Aware Minimization\uff08SAM\uff09\u89c6\u89d2\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6MSF\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u5c40\u90e8\u9c81\u68d2\u534a\u5f84\u91cf\u5316\u635f\u5931\u5c16\u9510\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u51cf\u5c0f\uff1b\u8fdb\u800c\u63d0\u51fa\u80fd\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9c81\u68d2\u534a\u5f84\u7684\u5355\u8c03\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u80fd\u91cf\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6\uff08E2A\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u80fd\u91cf\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u6270\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u4f2aOOD\u6837\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cE2A\u4e00\u81f4\u63d0\u5347\u56feOOD\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c40\u90e8\u635f\u5931\u5c16\u9510\u6027\uff08\u7531\u9c81\u68d2\u534a\u5f84\u523b\u753b\uff09\u662f\u5bfc\u81f4MSF\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u589e\u5f3a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6cdb\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

We prove several theoretical properties of magnitude distance, including its limiting behavior across scales and conditions under which it satisfies key metric properties. In contrast to classical distances, we show that magnitude distance remains discriminative in high-dimensional settings when the scale is appropriately tuned.

We present AnomSeer to address this by reinforcing the model to ground its reasoning in precise, structural details of time series, unifying anomaly classification, localization, and explanation. At its core, an expert chain-of-thought trace is generated to provide a verifiable, fine-grained reasoning from classical analyses (e.g., statistical measures, frequency transforms). Building on this, we propose a novel time-series grounded policy optimization (TimerPO) that incorporates two additional components beyond standard reinforcement learning: a time-series grounded advantage based on optimal transport and an orthogonal projection to ensure this auxiliary granular signal does not interfere with the primary detection objective.

While allocation policies aim to maximize population-level outcomes, current approaches often fail to account for the dynamic arrival of organs and the composition of waitlisted candidates, thereby hampering efficiency. The United States is transitioning from rigid, rule-based allocation to more flexible data-driven models. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for non-myopic policy optimization in general online matching relying on potentials, a concept originally introduced for kidney exchange. We develop scalable and accurate ways of learning potentials that are higher-dimensional and more expressive than prior approaches. Our approach is a form of self-supervised imitation learning: the potentials are trained to mimic an omniscient algorithm that has perfect foresight. We focus on the application of heart transplant allocation and demonstrate, using real historical data, that our policies significantly outperform prior approaches -- including the current US status quo policy and the proposed continuous distribution framework -- in optimizing for population-level outcomes. Our analysis and methods come at a pivotal moment in US policy, as the current heart transplant allocation system is under review.

Amortized SR promises to be much more efficient than the predominant genetic programming SR methods, but currently struggles to scale to realistic scientific complexity. We find that a key obstacle is the lack of a fast reduction of equivalent expressions to a concise normalized form. Amortized SR has addressed this by general-purpose Computer Algebra Systems (CAS) like SymPy, but the high computational cost severely limits training and inference speed. We propose SimpliPy, a rule-based simplification engine achieving a 100-fold speed-up over SymPy at comparable quality. This enables substantial improvements in amortized SR, including scalability to much larger training sets, more efficient use of the per-expression token budget, and systematic training set decontamination with respect to equivalent test expressions. We demonstrate these advantages in our Flash-ANSR framework, which achieves much better accuracy than amortized baselines (NeSymReS, E2E) on the FastSRB benchmark.

We show empirically that memorization is sparse, intermittent, and token-conditioned, suggesting that effective mitigation requires context-aware intervention rather than static parameter modification. To this end, we propose a novel and effective selective memorization mitigation method -- Gated Subspace Steering (GSS), which decomposes intervention into a probe (detecting memorization-relevant activations) and a steer (applying targeted correction only when the probe exceeds a threshold). The optimal probe-steer pair emerges from a principled optimization framework based on optimal subspace steering. Experiments on four benchmarks show GSS matches or exceeds state-of-the-art memorization reduction while requiring $100-1000 \\times$ less compute than optimization-based alternatives.

In such settings, multiple distinct sparse subsets may explain the response equally well. Identifying these alternatives is crucial for generating domain-specific insights into the underlying mechanisms, yet conventional methods typically isolate a single solution, obscuring the full spectrum of plausible explanations.\n  We present GEMSS (Gaussian Ensemble for Multiple Sparse Solutions), a variational Bayesian framework specifically designed to simultaneously discover multiple, diverse sparse feature combinations. The method employs a structured spike-and-slab prior for sparsity, a mixture of Gaussians to approximate the intractable multimodal posterior, and a Jaccard-based penalty to further control solution diversity. Unlike sequential greedy approaches, GEMSS optimizes the entire ensemble of solutions within a single objective function via stochastic gradient descent.\n  The method is validated on a comprehensive benchmark comprising 128 synthetic experiments across classification and regression tasks. Results demonstrate that GEMSS scales effectively to high-dimensional settings ($p=5000$) with sample size as small as $n = 50$, generalizes seamlessly to continuous targets, handles missing data natively, and exhibits remarkable robustness to class imbalance and Gaussian noise.\n  GEMSS is available as a Python package 'gemss' at PyPI. The full GitHub repository at https://github.com/kat-er-ina/gemss/ also includes a free, easy-to-use application suitable for non-coders.", "AI": {"tldr": "GEMSS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53d8\u5206\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u3001\u4f4e\u6837\u672c\u3001\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u4e2a\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u7279\u5f81\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u9886\u57df\u6d1e\u5bdf\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728n\u8fdc\u5c0f\u4e8ep\u4e14\u53d8\u91cf\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u540c\u6837\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u7279\u5f81\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u8fd4\u56de\u5355\u4e00\u89e3\uff0c\u63a9\u76d6\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u673a\u5236\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGEMSS\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u91c7\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316spike-and-slab\u5148\u9a8c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u8fd1\u4f3c\u591a\u5cf0\u540e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165Jaccard\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u60e9\u7f5a\u63a7\u5236\u89e3\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6574\u4e2a\u89e3\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728128\u7ec4\u5408\u6210\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cGEMSS\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u81f3p=5000\u3001n=50\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u56de\u5f52/\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u5929\u7136\u5904\u7406\u7f3a\u5931\u503c\u3001\u5bf9\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u3002", "conclusion": "GEMSS\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u7a33\u5065\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u591a\u89e3\u7a00\u758f\u5efa\u6a21\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e76\u5df2\u5f00\u6e90\u4e3aPython\u5305\u53ca\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Yet, most existing pre-trained transformers do not have a principled mechanism for uncertainty propagation through their feature transformation stack. In this work, we propose a diffusion-inspired reconfiguration of transformers in which each feature transformation block is modeled as a probabilistic mapping. Composing these probabilistic mappings reveals a probability path that mimics the structure of a diffusion process, transporting data mass from the input distribution to the pre-trained feature distribution. This probability path can then be recompiled on a diffusion process with a unified transition model to enable principled propagation of representation uncertainty throughout the pre-trained model's architecture while maintaining its original predictive performance.

Code available", "summary": "AI-text detectors face a critical robustness challenge: adversarial paraphrasing attacks that preserve semantics while evading detection. We introduce StealthRL, a reinforcement learning framework that stress-tests detector robustness under realistic adversarial conditions. StealthRL trains a paraphrase policy against a multi-detector ensemble using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with LoRA adapters on Qwen3-4B, optimizing a composite reward that balances detector evasion with semantic preservation. We evaluate six attack settings (M0-M5) against three detector families (RoBERTa, FastDetectGPT, and Binoculars) at the security-relevant 1% false positive rate operating point. StealthRL achieves near-zero detection (0.001 mean TPR@1%FPR), reduces mean AUROC from 0.74 to 0.27, and attains a 99.9% attack success rate. Critically, attacks transfer to a held-out detector family not seen during training, revealing shared architectural vulnerabilities rather than detector-specific brittleness. We additionally conduct LLM-based quality evaluation via Likert scoring, analyze detector score distributions to explain why evasion succeeds, and provide per-detector AUROC with bootstrap confidence intervals.

An effective ambiguity set for DRO must involve distributions that remain consistent to the nominal distribution while being diverse enough to account for a variety of potential scenarios. Moreover, it should lead to tractable DRO solutions. To this end, we propose generative model-based ambiguity sets that capture various adversarial distributions beyond the nominal support space while maintaining consistency with the nominal distribution. Building on this generative ambiguity modeling, we propose DRO with Generative Ambiguity Set (GAS-DRO), a tractable DRO algorithm that solves the inner maximization over the parameterized generative model space.

However, real-world systems, from shifting financial cycles to elastic biological rhythms, frequently exhibit \"time-warped\" dynamics where the effective flow of time decouples from the sampling index. In this work, we first formalize this misalignment and prove that rotary position embedding (RoPE) is mathematically incapable of representing non-affine temporal warping. To address this, we propose Symplectic Positional Embeddings (SyPE), a learnable encoding framework derived from Hamiltonian mechanics. SyPE strictly generalizes RoPE by extending the rotation group $\\mathrm{SO}(2)$ to the symplectic group $\\mathrm{Sp}(2,\\mathbb{R})$, modulated by a novel input-dependent adaptive warp module. By allowing the attention mechanism to adaptively dilate or contract temporal coordinates end-to-end, our approach captures locally varying periodicities without requiring pre-defined warping functions. We implement this mechanism in StretchTime, a multivariate forecasting architecture that achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks, demonstrating superior robustness on datasets exhibiting non-stationary temporal dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u6846\u67b6Symplectic Positional Embeddings (SyPE)\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3Transformer\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5bf9\u975e\u5747\u5300\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5f62\uff08time-warping\uff09\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff1bSyPE\u5c06RoPE\u4eceSO(2)\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230Sp(2,\u211d)\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u8f93\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u626d\u66f2\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u914d\u5408StretchTime\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u65f6\u5e8f\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\uff08\u5982\u91d1\u878d\u3001\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u53f7\uff09\u5e38\u5448\u73b0\u201c\u65f6\u95f4\u626d\u66f2\u201d\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5373\u6709\u6548\u65f6\u95f4\u6d41\u4e0e\u91c7\u6837\u7d22\u5f15\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709Transformer\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\uff08RoPE\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u5efa\u6a21\u975e\u4eff\u5c04\u65f6\u95f4\u626d\u66f2\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSymplectic Positional Embeddings (SyPE)\uff0c\u4ece\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u529b\u5b66\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u5c06RoPE\u4e2d\u7684\u4e8c\u7ef4\u65cb\u8f6c\u7fa4SO(2)\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u8f9b\u7fa4Sp(2,\u211d)\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f93\u5165\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u626d\u66f2\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4f7f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5730\u62c9\u4f38\u6216\u538b\u7f29\u65f6\u95f4\u5750\u6807\uff1b\u5c06\u5176\u96c6\u6210\u4e8e\u65b0\u67b6\u6784StretchTime\u4e2d\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u5e8f\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "StretchTime\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u65f6\u5e8f\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u4f18\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SyPE\u4e3aTransformer\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u4e14\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u626d\u66f2\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u5bf9\u5747\u5300\u65f6\u95f4\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u4e3a\u5efa\u6a21\u590d\u6742\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u65f6\u5e8f\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Brown", "Thomas Trappenberg"], "title": "Improving Detection of Rare Nodes in Hierarchical Multi-Label Learning", "comment": "Accepted for publication in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR), 2026", "summary": "In hierarchical multi-label classification, a persistent challenge is enabling model predictions to reach deeper levels of the hierarchy for more detailed or fine-grained classifications. This difficulty partly arises from the natural rarity of certain classes (or hierarchical nodes) and the hierarchical constraint that ensures child nodes are almost always less frequent than their parents. To address this, we propose a weighted loss objective for neural networks that combines node-wise imbalance weighting with focal weighting components, the latter leveraging modern quantification of ensemble uncertainties. By emphasizing rare nodes rather than rare observations (data points), and focusing on uncertain nodes for each model output distribution during training, we observe improvements in recall by up to a factor of five on benchmark datasets, along with statistically significant gains in $F_{1}$ score. We also show our approach aids convolutional networks on challenging tasks, as in situations with suboptimal encoders or limited data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u8282\u70b9\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u52a0\u6743\u548c\u7126\u70b9\u52a0\u6743\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5c42\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u6df1\u5c42\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u6539\u5584\u7a00\u6709\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548cF1\u5206\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u5c42\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6df1\u5c42\u8282\u70b9\u56e0\u5929\u7136\u7a00\u6709\u6027\u548c\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u5b50\u8282\u70b9\u9891\u7387\u901a\u5e38\u4f4e\u4e8e\u7236\u8282\u70b9\uff09\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u88ab\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u52a0\u6743\u635f\u5931\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u8282\u70b9\u7ea7\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u52a0\u6743\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u96c6\u6210\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u7126\u70b9\u52a0\u6743\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u7a00\u6709\u8282\u70b9\u800c\u975e\u7a00\u6709\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u805a\u7126\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe5\u500d\uff0cF1\u5206\u6570\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u5bf9\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6b20\u4f73\u6216\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e5f\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u52a0\u6743\u635f\u5931\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u5206\u5c42\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u6df1\u5c42\u7a00\u6709\u8282\u70b9\u9884\u6d4b\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

We introduce Dirichlet-Routed MoE (DirMoE), a novel end-to-end differentiable routing mechanism built on a Dirichlet variational autoencoder framework. This design fundamentally disentangles the core routing problems: expert selection, modeled by a Bernoulli component, and expert contribution among chosen experts, handled by a Dirichlet component. The entire forward pass remains fully differentiable through the use of Gumbel-Sigmoid relaxation for the expert selection and implicit reparameterization for the Dirichlet distribution. Our training objective, a variational ELBO, includes a direct sparsity penalty that precisely controls the number of active experts in expectation, alongside a schedule for key hyperparameters that guides the model from an exploratory to a definitive routing state.

We present \\textbf{Adaptively Rotated Optimization (ARO}, a new matrix optimization framework that treats gradient rotation as a first class design principle. ARO accelerates LLM training by performing normed steepest descent in a rotated coordinate system, where the rotation is determined by a novel norm-informed policy. This perspective yields update rules that go beyond existing orthogonalization and whitening optimizers, improving sample efficiency in practice. To make comparisons reliable, we propose a rigorously controlled benchmarking protocol that reduces confounding and bias. Under this protocol, ARO consistently outperforms AdamW (by 1.3 $\\sim$1.35$\\times$) and orthogonalization methods (by 1.1$\\sim$1.15$\\times$) in LLM pretraining at up to 8B activated parameters, and up to $8\\times$ overtrain budget, without evidence of diminishing returns.

Dataset condensation can alleviate this by synthesizing a compact training set that preserves key information. Yet most condensation methods are image-centric and often fail on time series because they miss time-series-specific temporal structure, especially local discriminative motifs such as shapelets. In this work, we propose ShapeCond, a novel and efficient condensation framework for time series classification that leverages shapelet-based dataset knowledge via a shapelet-guided optimization strategy. Our shapelet-assisted synthesis cost is independent of sequence length: longer series yield larger speedups in synthesis (e.g., 29$\\times$ faster over prior state-of-the-art method CondTSC for time-series condensation, and up to 10,000$\\times$ over naively using shapelets on the Sleep dataset with 3,000 timesteps). By explicitly preserving critical local patterns, ShapeCond improves downstream accuracy and consistently outperforms all prior state-of-the-art time series dataset condensation methods across extensive experiments.

This paper revisits the default mechanism for deepening neural networks, namely residual connections, from an optimization perspective. Rigorous analysis proves that the layout of residual connections can fundamentally shape convergence behavior, and even induces an exponential gap in convergence rates. Prompted by this insight, we introduce adaptive neural connection reassignment (ANCRe), a principled and lightweight framework that parameterizes and learns residual connectivities from the data. ANCRe adaptively reassigns residual connections with negligible computational and memory overhead ($<1\\%$), while enabling more effective utilization of network depth. Extensive numerical tests across pre-training of large language models, diffusion models, and deep ResNets demonstrate consistently accelerated convergence, boosted performance, and enhanced depth efficiency over conventional residual connections.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u4f18\u5316\u89d2\u5ea6\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u795e\u7ecf\u8fde\u63a5\u91cd\u5206\u914d\uff08ANCRe\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u5e03\u5c40\uff0c\u5728\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6df1\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ed8\u8ba4\u52a0\u6df1\u6df1\u5ea6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5e03\u5c40\u5bf9\u4f18\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u6df1\u5c42\u5e38\u88ab\u4f4e\u6548\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faANCRe\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u7ed3\u6784\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5e76\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u8fde\u63a5\u5e03\u5c40\u53ef\u5bfc\u81f4\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\u7684\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fde\u63a5\u91cd\u5206\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u6df1\u5c42ResNet\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1a\u6536\u655b\u52a0\u901f\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u6548\u7387\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500<1%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u5e03\u5c40\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u6df1\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff1bANCRe\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u666e\u9002\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u91cd\u914d\u7f6e\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u6df1\u5ea6\u5229\u7528\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}
