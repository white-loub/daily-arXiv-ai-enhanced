Code and tools: https://github.com/AerisSpace/EthicalEntropyKit", "summary": "Large language model safety is usually assessed with static benchmarks, but key failures are dynamic: value drift under distribution shift, jailbreak attacks, and slow degradation of alignment in deployment. Building on a recent Second Law of Intelligence that treats ethical entropy as a state variable which tends to increase unless countered by alignment work, we make this framework operational for large language models. We define a five-way behavioral taxonomy, train a classifier to estimate ethical entropy S(t) from model transcripts, and measure entropy dynamics for base and instruction-tuned variants of four frontier models across stress tests. Base models show sustained entropy growth, while tuned variants suppress drift and reduce ethical entropy by roughly eighty percent. From these trajectories we estimate an effective alignment work rate gamma_eff and embed S(t) and gamma_eff in a monitoring pipeline that raises alerts when entropy drift exceeds a stability threshold, enabling run-time oversight of value drift.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e'\u667a\u80fd\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5b9a\u5f8b'\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u71b5S(t)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u63a7\u7ba1\u9053\u4ee5\u9884\u8b66\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u6f02\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4f46\u5173\u952e\u5931\u8d25\uff08\u5982\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u6f02\u79fb\u3001\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u3001\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u7f13\u6162\u9000\u5316\uff09\u5177\u6709\u52a8\u6001\u6027\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u52a8\u6001\u76d1\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e94\u7ef4\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4ece\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u4e2d\u4f30\u8ba1\u4f26\u7406\u71b5S(t)\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u538b\u529b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0b\u6d4b\u91cf\u56db\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7ebf\u7248\u4e0e\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u7248\u7684\u71b5\u52a8\u6001\uff1b\u8fdb\u800c\u4f30\u7b97\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u9f50\u505a\u529f\u901f\u7387gamma_eff\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5d4c\u5165\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u63a7\u7ba1\u9053\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u5448\u73b0\u6301\u7eed\u71b5\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u800c\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u6291\u5236\u6f02\u79fb\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u4f26\u7406\u71b5\u7ea680%\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u8f68\u8ff9\u6210\u529f\u4f30\u7b97gamma_eff\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u8fc7\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u9608\u503c\u65f6\u81ea\u52a8\u544a\u8b66\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f26\u7406\u71b5\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8861\u91cf\u548c\u76d1\u63a7\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50\u76d1\u7763\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Based on these LLMs, businesses have started to provide Embeddings-as-a-Service (EaaS), offering feature extraction capabilities (in the form of text embeddings) that benefit downstream natural language processing tasks. However, prior research has demonstrated that EaaS is vulnerable to imitation attacks, where an attacker clones the service's model in a black-box manner without access to the model's internal workings. In response, watermarks have been added to the text embeddings to protect the intellectual property of EaaS providers by allowing them to check for model ownership. This thesis focuses on defending against imitation attacks by investigating EaaS watermarks. To achieve this goal, we unveil novel attacks and propose and validate new watermarking techniques.\n  Firstly, we show that existing EaaS watermarks can be removed through paraphrasing the input text when attackers clone the model during imitation attacks. Our study illustrates that paraphrasing can effectively bypass current state-of-the-art EaaS watermarks across various attack setups (including different paraphrasing techniques and models) and datasets in most instances. This demonstrates a new vulnerability in recent EaaS watermarking techniques.\n  Subsequently, as a countermeasure, we propose a novel watermarking technique, WET (Watermarking EaaS with Linear Transformation), which employs linear transformation of the embeddings. Watermark verification is conducted by applying a reverse transformation and comparing the similarity between recovered and original embeddings. We demonstrate its robustness against paraphrasing attacks with near-perfect verifiability. We conduct detailed ablation studies to assess the significance of each component and hyperparameter in WET.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76Embeddings-as-a-Service\uff08EaaS\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6c34\u5370\u6613\u88ab\u6587\u672c\u6539\u5199\u653b\u51fb\u7ed5\u8fc7\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u65b0\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5WET\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "EaaS\u670d\u52a1\u9762\u4e34\u9ed1\u76d2\u6a21\u4eff\u653b\u51fb\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5d4c\u5165\u6c34\u5370\u6613\u88ab\u8f93\u5165\u6587\u672c\u6539\u5199\u7ed5\u8fc7\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u673a\u5236\u4fdd\u62a4\u6a21\u578b\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709\u6c34\u5370\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6539\u5199\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u5931\u6548\u73b0\u8c61\uff1b\u8fdb\u800c\u63d0\u51faWET\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u6362\u5d4c\u5165\u6c34\u5370\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u9006\u53d8\u6362\u4e0e\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u6bd4\u5bf9\u5b9e\u73b0\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524dSOTA\u6c34\u5370\u666e\u904d\u53ef\u88ab\u6539\u5199\u653b\u51fb\u79fb\u9664\uff1bWET\u5728\u6539\u5199\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u8fd1100%\u6c34\u5370\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5404\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6587\u672c\u6539\u5199\u662fEaaS\u6c34\u5370\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5a01\u80c1\uff0cWET\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5d4c\u5165\u53d8\u6362\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6c34\u5370\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5546\u7528\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5d4c\u5165\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this work, we present the first solution to address CSB through Reasoning Dependency Generation (RDG), a novel framework for generating unbiased reasoning data to mitigate choice-supportive bias through fine-tuning. RDG automatically constructs balanced reasoning QA pairs, explicitly (un)modeling the dependencies between choices, evidences, and justifications. Our approach is able to generate a large-scale dataset of QA pairs across domains, incorporating Contextual Dependency Data and Dependency Decouple Data. Experiments show that LLMs fine-tuned on RDG-generated data demonstrate a 81.5% improvement in memory-based experiments and 94.3% improvement in the evaluation-based experiment, while maintaining similar performance on standard BBQ benchmarks.

Existing RAG approaches often focus on general documents, and they overlook the fact that many real-world documents (such as books, booklets, handbooks, etc.) have a hierarchical structure, which organizes their content from different granularity levels, leading to poor performance for the QA task. To address these limitations, we introduce BookRAG, a novel RAG approach targeted for documents with a hierarchical structure, which exploits logical hierarchies and traces entity relations to query the highly relevant information. Specifically, we build a novel index structure, called BookIndex, by extracting a hierarchical tree from the document, which serves as the role of its table of contents, using a graph to capture the intricate relationships between entities, and mapping entities to tree nodes. Leveraging the BookIndex, we then propose an agent-based query method inspired by the Information Foraging Theory, which dynamically classifies queries and employs a tailored retrieval workflow.

Traditional recommendation systems often lack explainability and suffer from issues such as popularity bias. Previous research has also indicated that LLMs, when used as standalone predictors, fail to achieve accuracy comparable to traditional models. To address these challenges, we propose to use LLM as an explainable re-ranker, a hybrid approach that combines traditional recommendation models with LLMs to enhance both accuracy and interpretability. We constructed a dataset to train the re-ranker LLM and evaluated the alignment between the generated dataset and human expectations. Leveraging a two-stage training process, our model significantly improved NDCG, a key ranking metric.

It raises some risk factors for existing governance approaches as they remain fragmented: Existing frameworks are either static taxonomies driven; however, they lack an integrated end-to-end pipeline from risk identification to operational assurance, especially for an agentic platform. We propose AGENTSAFE, a practical governance framework for LLM-based agentic systems. The framework operationalises the AI Risk Repository into design, runtime, and audit controls, offering a governance framework for risk identification and assurance. The proposed framework, AGENTSAFE, profiles agentic loops (plan -> act -> observe -> reflect) and toolchains, and maps risks onto structured taxonomies extended with agent-specific vulnerabilities. It introduces safeguards that constrain risky behaviours, escalates high-impact actions to human oversight, and evaluates systems through pre-deployment scenario banks spanning security, privacy, fairness, and systemic safety. During deployment, AGENTSAFE ensures continuous governance through semantic telemetry, dynamic authorization, anomaly detection, and interruptibility mechanisms. Provenance and accountability are reinforced through cryptographic tracing and organizational controls, enabling measurable, auditable assurance across the lifecycle of agentic AI systems. The key contributions of this paper are: (1) a unified governance framework that translates risk taxonomies into actionable design, runtime, and audit controls; (2) an Agent Safety Evaluation methodology that provides measurable pre-deployment assurance; and (3) a set of runtime governance and accountability mechanisms that institutionalise trust in agentic AI ecosystems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AGENTSAFE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6cbb\u7406\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u98ce\u9669\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u4fdd\u969c\u4e0e\u5ba1\u8ba1\u8ffd\u8e2a\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u90e8\u7f72\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u8fd0\u884c\u6cbb\u7406\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u6027\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709AI\u6cbb\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3001\u9759\u6001\u5316\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9762\u5411LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u81ea\u4e3b\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u591a\u6b65\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u53ca\u6d8c\u73b0\u4ea4\u4e92\u7279\u6027\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6cbb\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u65b0\u578b\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAGENTSAFE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06AI\u98ce\u9669\u5e93\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5c42\u3001\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5c42\u548c\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5c42\u4e09\u7c7b\u63a7\u5236\uff1b\u5efa\u6a21\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5faa\u73af\uff08plan\u2192act\u2192observe\u2192reflect\uff09\u4e0e\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4ee3\u7406\u7279\u6709\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u7c7b\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u884c\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u4eba\u5de5\u4ecb\u5165\u5347\u7ea7\u3001\u573a\u666f\u5316\u9884\u90e8\u7f72\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08\u542b\u5b89\u5168/\u9690\u79c1/\u516c\u5e73/\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\uff09\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u9065\u6d4b\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u6388\u6743\u3001\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u53ef\u4e2d\u65ad\u673a\u5236\u53ca\u5bc6\u7801\u5b66\u6eaf\u6e90\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u2014\u63a7\u5236\u6620\u5c04\u6cbb\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u7684Agent Safety Evaluation\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u843d\u5730\u4e86\u652f\u6301\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u63a7\u3001\u54cd\u5e94\u4e0e\u8ffd\u8d23\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6cbb\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5b89\u5168\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "AGENTSAFE\u586b\u8865\u4e86LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5168\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5c06\u62bd\u8c61\u98ce\u9669\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u5b9e\u65bd\u3001\u53ef\u5ea6\u91cf\u3001\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u4fe1\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u751f\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6cbb\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

While Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising framework, existing methods often struggle with the multi-granularity of tasks (long-term strategy vs. instant actions) and the complexity of large-scale agent interactions. This paper presents a unified Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework that addresses these challenges. First, we establish a baseline using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) within a client-server architecture for real-time action scheduling, with PPO demonstrating superior performance (4.32 avg. goals, 82.9% ball control). Second, we introduce a Hierarchical RL (HRL) structure based on the options framework to decompose the problem into a high-level trajectory planning layer (modeled as a Semi-Markov Decision Process) and a low-level action execution layer, improving global strategy (avg. goals increased to 5.26). Finally, to ensure scalability, we integrate mean-field theory into the HRL framework, simplifying many-agent interactions into a single agent vs. the population average. Our mean-field actor-critic method achieves a significant performance boost (5.93 avg. goals, 89.1% ball control, 92.3% passing accuracy) and enhanced training stability. Extensive simulations of 4v4 matches in the Webots environment validate our approach, demonstrating its potential for robust, scalable, and cooperative behavior in complex multi-agent domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MARL\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408PPO\u3001\u5206\u5c42RL\uff08HRL\uff09\u4e0e\u5e73\u5747\u573a\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8db3\u7403\u7b49\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u6297\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u3001\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MARL\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u6027\uff08\u957f\u671f\u7b56\u7565 vs \u77ac\u65f6\u52a8\u4f5c\uff09\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u6297\u73af\u5883\uff08\u5982\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8db3\u7403\uff09\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u5b9e\u65f6\u51b3\u7b56\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u534f\u4f5c\u4e0e\u7ef4\u6570\u707e\u96be\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef-\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u6784\u5efaPPO\u57fa\u51c6\uff1b2\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8eoptions\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5206\u5c42RL\uff08HRL\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u9ad8\u5c42\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\uff08Semi-Markov\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff09\u4e0e\u4f4e\u5c42\u52a8\u4f5c\u6267\u884c\uff1b3\uff09\u5728HRL\u4e2d\u878d\u5408\u5e73\u5747\u573a\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e0e\u7fa4\u4f53\u5747\u503c\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e73\u5747\u573aActor-Critic\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728Webots 4v4\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u8fdb\u7403\u6570\u8fbe5.93\uff08\u57fa\u7ebf4.32\uff09\uff0c\u63a7\u7403\u738789.1%\uff08\u57fa\u7ebf82.9%\uff09\uff0c\u4f20\u7403\u51c6\u786e\u738792.3%\uff0c\u4e14\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u7edf\u4e00MARL\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u534f\u4f5c\u4e0e\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In materials science, ML has primarily supported large-scale discovery of novel compounds using first-principles data and digital twin applications for optimizing manufacturing processes. However, applying general-purpose ML frameworks to complex industrial materials such as steel remains a challenge. A key obstacle is accurately capturing the intricate relationship between chemical composition, processing parameters, and the resulting microstructure and properties. To address this, we introduce a computational framework that combines physical insights with ML to develop a physics-informed continuous cooling transformation (CCT) model for steels. Our model, trained on a dataset of 4,100 diagrams, is validated against literature and experimental data. It demonstrates high computational efficiency, generating complete CCT diagrams with 100 cooling curves in under 5 seconds. It also shows strong generalizability across alloy steels, achieving phase classification F1 scores above 88% for all phases. For phase transition temperature regression, it attains mean absolute errors (MAE) below 20 \u00b0C across all phases except bainite, which shows a slightly higher MAE of 27 \u00b0C. This framework can be extended with additional generic and customized ML models to establish a universal digital twin platform for heat treatment.

This requires fundamentally different learning paradigms from pixel-based visual models. Symbolic visual learners parse diagrams into geometric primitives-points, lines, and shapes-whereas pixel-based learners operate on textures and colors. We propose a novel self-supervised symbolic auto-encoder that encodes diagrams into structured primitives and their interrelationships within the latent space, and decodes them through our executable engine to reconstruct the input diagrams. Central to this architecture is Symbolic Hierarchical Process Reward Modeling, which applies hierarchical step-level parsing rewards to enforce point-on-line, line-on-shape, and shape-on-relation consistency. Since vanilla reinforcement learning exhibits poor exploration in the policy space during diagram reconstruction; we thus introduce stabilization mechanisms to balance exploration and exploitation. We fine-tune our symbolic encoder on downstream tasks, developing a neuro-symbolic system that integrates the reasoning capabilities of neural networks with the interpretability of symbolic models through reasoning-grounded visual rewards. Evaluations across reconstruction, perception, and reasoning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: achieving a 98.2% reduction in MSE for geometric diagram reconstruction, surpassing GPT-4o by 0.6% with a 7B model on chart reconstruction, and improving by +13% on the MathGlance perception benchmark, and by +3% on MathVerse and GeoQA reasoning benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u7b26\u53f7\u5316\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b26\u53f7\u5206\u5c42\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\u5b9e\u73b0\u51e0\u4f55\u56fe\u89e3\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89e3\u6790\u4e0e\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u50cf\u7d20\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u56fe\u89e3\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u800c\u7b26\u53f7\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u6765\u89e3\u6790\u51e0\u4f55\u539f\u59cb\u5143\u7d20\u53ca\u5176\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u7b26\u53f7\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7b26\u53f7\u5206\u5c42\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\uff08\u5982\u70b9\u5728\u7ebf\u4e0a\u3001\u7ebf\u5728\u5f62\u72b6\u4e0a\u7b49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff09\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u5316\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5956\u52b1\u878d\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u56fe\u89e3\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2dMSE\u964d\u4f4e98.2%\uff1b\u56fe\u8868\u91cd\u5efa\u8d85\u8d8aGPT-4o 0.6%\uff08\u4f7f\u75287B\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff1bMathGlance\u611f\u77e5\u57fa\u51c6\u63d0\u534713%\uff0cMathVerse\u4e0eGeoQA\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u63d0\u53473%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56fe\u89e3\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6709\u6548\u534f\u540c\u3002"}}

Philosophical analysis of AI alignment (process-based / syntropy framework)", "summary": "I argue that AI alignment should be reconceived as architecting syntropic, reasons-responsive agents through process-based, multi-agent, developmental mechanisms rather than encoding fixed human value content. The paper makes three philosophical contributions. First, I articulate the ``specification trap'' argument demonstrating why content-based value specification appears structurally unstable due to the conjunction of the is-ought gap, value pluralism, and the extended frame problem. Second, I propose syntropy -- the recursive reduction of mutual uncertainty between agents through state alignment -- as an information-theoretic framework for understanding multi-agent alignment dynamics. Third, I establish a functional distinction between genuine and simulated moral capacity grounded in compatibilist theories of guidance control, coupled with an embodied experimental paradigm and verification regime providing operational criteria independent of phenomenological claims. This paper represents the philosophical component of a broader research program whose empirical validation is being developed in a separate project currently in preparation. While the framework generates specific, falsifiable predictions about value emergence and moral agency in artificial systems, empirical validation remains pending.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3b\u5f20\u5c06AI\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u91cd\u65b0\u6784\u60f3\u4e3a\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3001\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3001\u53d1\u5c55\u6027\u673a\u5236\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u5177\u6709\u2018\u71b5\u51cf\u2019\u7279\u6027\u548c\u7406\u7531\u54cd\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u8bd5\u56fe\u7f16\u7801\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u5185\u5bb9\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u2018\u89c4\u8303\u9677\u9631\u2019\u8bba\u8bc1\u3001\u2018\u71b5\u51cf\u2019\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u533a\u5206\u771f\u5b9e\u4e0e\u6a21\u62df\u9053\u5fb7\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u2018\u662f- ought\u2019\u9e3f\u6c9f\u3001\u4ef7\u503c\u591a\u5143\u4e3b\u4e49\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u6846\u67b6\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5171\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u6307\u5b9a\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003AI\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6839\u672c\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u54f2\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u2018\u89c4\u8303\u9677\u9631\u2019\u8bba\u8bc1\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u2018\u71b5\u51cf\u2019\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u517c\u5bb9\u8bba\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a7\u5236\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u533a\u5206\u771f\u5b9e\u4e0e\u6a21\u62df\u9053\u5fb7\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u8f85\u4ee5\u5177\u8eab\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u786e\u7acb\u4e86AI\u5bf9\u9f50\u5e94\u8f6c\u5411\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6027\u3001\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3001\u53d1\u5c55\u6027\u673a\u5236\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u2018\u71b5\u51cf\u2019\u6982\u5ff5\u523b\u753b\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u72b6\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9012\u51cf\uff1b\u7ed9\u51fa\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u3001\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u73b0\u8c61\u5b66\u4e3b\u5f20\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u80fd\u529b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u5e94\u8ffd\u6c42\u9759\u6001\u4ef7\u503c\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u800c\u5e94\u81f4\u529b\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u4e92\u6f14\u5316\u51fa\u7406\u7531\u54cd\u5e94\u4e0e\u9053\u5fb7\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1b\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u867d\u5177\u53ef\u8bc1\u4f2a\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u8bc1\u68c0\u9a8c\u5c1a\u5f85\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u5b8c\u6210\u3002"}}

Many Text2KG methods, however, rely on iterative LLM prompting, making them computationally expensive and prone to overlooking complex relations distributed throughout the text. To address these limitations, we propose InvertiTune, a framework that combines a controlled data generation pipeline with supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Within this framework, the data-generation pipeline systematically extracts subgraphs from large knowledge bases, applies noise filtering, and leverages LLMs to generate corresponding natural text descriptions, a task more aligned with LLM capabilities than direct KG generation from text. This pipeline enables generating datasets composed of longer texts paired with larger KGs that better reflect real-world scenarios compared to existing benchmarks, thus supporting effective SFT of lightweight models for single-shot KG construction. Experimental results on CE12k, a dataset generated using the introduced pipeline, show that InvertiTune outperforms larger non-fine-tuned LLMs as well as state-of-the-art Text2KG approaches, while also demonstrating stronger cross-dataset generalization on CrossEval-1200, a test set created from three established benchmark datasets and CE12k.

However, most existing approaches remain heavily English-centric, limiting their effectiveness in multilingual contexts. In this work, we present M3DR (Multilingual Multimodal Document Retrieval), a framework designed to bridge this gap across languages, enabling applicability across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts. M3DR leverages synthetic multilingual document data and generalizes across different vision-language architectures and model sizes, enabling robust cross-lingual and cross-modal alignment. Using contrastive training, our models learn unified representations for text and document images that transfer effectively across languages. We validate this capability on 22 typologically diverse languages, demonstrating consistent performance and adaptability across linguistic and script variations.

Unlike a Voronoi diagram, a Delaunay tetrahedralization yields simple triangles that are natively supported by existing hardware. As such, our model is able to perform exact and fast volume rendering using both rasterization and ray-tracing. We introduce a new rasterization method that achieves faster rendering speeds than all prior radiance field representations (assuming an equivalent number of primitives and resolution) across a variety of platforms. Optimizing the positions of Delaunay vertices introduces topological discontinuities (edge flips). To solve this, we use a Zip-NeRF-style backbone which allows us to express a smoothly varying field even when the topology changes. Our rendering method exactly evaluates the volume rendering equation and enables high quality, real-time view synthesis on standard consumer hardware.

In this context, we address a key open challenge: enabling heterogeneous AI agents to exchange compressed latent-space representations while mitigating semantic noise and preserving task-relevant meaning. We cast this challenge as learning both the communication topology and the alignment maps that govern information exchange among agents, yielding a learned network sheaf equipped with orthogonal maps. This learning process is further supported by a semantic denoising end compression module that constructs a shared global semantic space and derives sparse, structured representations of each agent's latent space. This corresponds to a nonconvex dictionary learning problem solved iteratively with closed-form updates. Experiments with mutiple AI agents pre-trained on real image data show that the semantic denoising and compression facilitates AI agents alignment and the extraction of semantic clusters, while preserving high accuracy in downstream task.

In this article, we address task scheduling for lifelong Multi-Agent Pickup-and-Delivery (MAPD) and propose a hybrid method that couples learning-based global guidance with lightweight optimization. A graph neural network policy trained via reinforcement learning outputs a desired distribution of free agents over an aggregated warehouse graph. This signal is converted into region-to-region rebalancing through a minimum-cost flow, and finalized by small, local assignment problems, preserving accuracy while keeping per-step latency within a 1 s compute budget. On congested warehouse benchmarks from the League of Robot Runners (LRR) with up to 500 agents, our approach improves throughput by up to 10% over the 2024 winning scheduler while maintaining real-time execution.

Specifically, using LCTs as inputs, we generate the full HDL for a two-dimensional network-on-chip router (13 units, 1500-2000 lines of code) using seven different LLMs, reconstruct the LCTs from the auto-generated HDL, and compare the original and reconstructed LCTs.

In this work, we propose a unified framework based on the concept of a \"drainage node'' which we add at the output of the network. The node serves to reallocate probability mass toward uncertainty, while preserving desirable properties such as end-to-end training and differentiability. This mechanism provides a natural escape route for highly ambiguous, anomalous, or noisy samples, particularly relevant for instance-dependent and asymmetric label noise. In systematic experiments involving the addition of varying proportions of instance-dependent noise or asymmetric noise to CIFAR-10/100 labels, our drainage formulation achieves an accuracy increase of up to 9\\% over existing approaches in the high-noise regime. Our results on real-world datasets, such as mini-WebVision, mini-ImageNet and Clothing-1M, match or surpass existing state-of-the-art methods. Qualitative analysis reveals a denoising effect, where the drainage neuron consistently absorbs corrupt, mislabeled, or outlier data, leading to more stable decision boundaries.

This paper introduces \"Weight-Calculatism,\" a novel cognitive architecture grounded in first principles, and demonstrates its potential as a viable pathway toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The architecture deconstructs cognition into indivisible Logical Atoms and two fundamental operations: Pointing and Comparison. Decision-making is formalized through an interpretable Weight-Calculation model (Weight = Benefit * Probability), where all values are traceable to an auditable set of Initial Weights.

Unlike binary matrix factorization based on standard arithmetic, BMF employs the Boolean OR and AND operations for the matrix product, which improves interpretability and reduces the approximation error. It is also used in role mining and computer vision. In this paper, we first propose algorithms for BMF that perform alternating optimization (AO) of the factor matrices, where each subproblem is solved via integer programming (IP). We then design different approaches to further enhance AO-based algorithms by selecting an optimal subset of rank-one factors from multiple runs. To address the scalability limits of IP-based methods, we introduce new greedy and local-search heuristics. We also construct a new C++ data structure for Boolean vectors and matrices that is significantly faster than existing ones and is of independent interest, allowing our heuristics to scale to large datasets.

The main contributions of this work are: (1) demonstrating that a deep learning model, trained on a mix of real and synthetic images, can accurately predict camera and lens parameters from a single image, and (2) developing a comprehensive synthetic dataset using the AILiveSim simulation platform. This dataset includes variations in focal length and lens distortion parameters, providing a robust foundation for model training and testing. The training process predominantly relied on these synthetic images, complemented by a small subset of real images, to explore how well models trained on synthetic data can perform calibration tasks on real-world images. Traditional calibration methods require multiple images of a calibration object from various orientations, which is often not feasible due to the lack of such images in publicly available datasets. A deep learning network based on the ResNet architecture was trained on this synthetic dataset to predict camera calibration parameters following the Brown-Conrady lens model. The ResNet architecture, adapted for regression tasks, is capable of predicting continuous values essential for accurate camera calibration in applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality.\n  Keywords: Camera calibration, distortion, synthetic data, deep learning, residual networks (ResNet), AILiveSim, horizontal field-of-view, principal point, Brown-Conrady Model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ResNet\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u771f\u5b9e\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\uff08\u901a\u8fc7AILiveSim\u751f\u6210\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u5373\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u76f8\u673a\u5185\u53c2\u548c\u955c\u5934\u7578\u53d8\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u9075\u5faaBrown-Conrady\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6807\u5b9a\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u76f8\u673a\u6807\u5b9a\u9700\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6807\u5b9a\u677f\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u5e38\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6b64\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u4e9f\u9700\u4ec5\u7528\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u5b8c\u6210\u6807\u5b9a\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u6db5\u76d6\u4e0d\u540c\u7126\u8ddd\u4e0e\u7578\u53d8\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08AILiveSim\u751f\u6210\uff09\uff0c\u8f85\u4ee5\u5c11\u91cf\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u9002\u914d\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u7684ResNet\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u9884\u6d4bBrown-Conrady\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u5982\u6c34\u5e73\u89c6\u573a\u89d2\u3001\u4e3b\u70b9\u3001\u7578\u53d8\u7cfb\u6570\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ec5\u7528\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\uff0c\u80fd\u8f83\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u76f8\u673a\u5185\u53c2\u548c\u7578\u53d8\u53c2\u6570\uff1b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e3b\u5bfc\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u6807\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7eaf\u5355\u56fe\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6807\u5b9a\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6491\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u5e94\u7528\uff1b\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u3001\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3001AR\u7b49\u9700\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u5feb\u901f\u6807\u5b9a\u7684\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

Khan", "Mansura Habiba", "Rafflesia Khan"], "title": "A Gossip-Enhanced Communication Substrate for Agentic AI: Toward Decentralized Coordination in Large-Scale Multi-Agent Systems", "comment": null, "summary": "As agentic platforms scale, agents are moving beyond fixed roles and predefined toolchains, creating an urgent need for flexible and decentralized coordination. Current structured communication protocols such as direct agent-to-agent messaging or MCP-style tool calls offer reliability, but they struggle to support the emergent and swarm-like intelligence required in large adaptive systems. Distributed agents must learn continuously, share context fluidly, and coordinate without depending solely on central planners.\n  This paper revisits gossip protocols as a complementary substrate for agentic communication. Gossip mechanisms, long valued in distributed systems for their decentralized and fault-tolerant properties, provide scalable and adaptive diffusion of knowledge and fill gaps that structured protocols alone cannot efficiently address. However, gossip also introduces challenges, including semantic relevance, temporal staleness, and limited guarantees on action consistency in rapidly changing environments.\n  We examine how gossip can support context-rich state propagation, resilient coordination under uncertainty, and emergent global awareness. We also outline open problems around semantic filtering, trust, and knowledge decay. Rather than proposing a complete framework, this paper presents a research agenda for integrating gossip into multi-agent communication stacks and argues that gossip is essential for future agentic ecosystems that must remain robust, adaptive, and self-organizing as their scale and autonomy increase.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06gossip\u534f\u8bae\u4f5c\u4e3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u8865\u5145\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u5bb9\u9519\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f20\u64ad\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u534f\u8c03\u53ca\u5168\u5c40\u610f\u8bc6\u6d8c\u73b0\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u8bed\u4e49\u8fc7\u6ee4\u3001\u4fe1\u4efb\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u8870\u51cf\u7b49\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5e73\u53f0\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5927\uff0c\u56fa\u5b9a\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\u5df2\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u901a\u4fe1\u534f\u8bae\u96be\u4ee5\u652f\u6491\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7cfb\u7edf\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\u5f0f\u548c\u7fa4\u4f53\u667a\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u5e76\u5206\u6790gossip\u534f\u8bae\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u4f20\u64ad\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u534f\u8c03\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u610f\u8bc6\u5f62\u6210\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u4e0e\u5f00\u653e\u7814\u7a76\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u8bc1\u4e86gossip\u534f\u8bae\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u8865\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e30\u5bcc\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3001\u65f6\u6548\u6027\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7b49\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "gossip\u534f\u8bae\u662f\u6784\u5efa\u672a\u6765\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u9ad8\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u3001\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u901a\u4fe1\u57fa\u5e95\uff0c\u9700\u5c06\u5176\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u878d\u5165\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u901a\u4fe1\u6808\uff0c\u5e76\u56f4\u7ed5\u8bed\u4e49\u3001\u4fe1\u4efb\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u6f14\u5316\u5f00\u5c55\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Yet, many systems and disturbance phenomena are difficult to model due to effects like nonlinearity, chaos, and high-dimensionality. Koopman theory addresses this by modeling the linear evolution of embeddings of the state under an infinite-dimensional linear operator that can be approximated with a suitable finite basis of embedding functions, effectively trading model nonlinearity for representational complexity. However, explicitly computing a good choice of basis is nontrivial, and poor choices may cause inaccurate forecasts or overfitting. To address this, we present Kalman-Implicit Koopman Operator (KALIKO) Learning, a method that leverages the Kalman filter to implicitly learn embeddings corresponding to latent dynamics without requiring an explicit encoder. KALIKO produces interpretable representations consistent with both theory and prior works, yielding high-quality reconstructions and inducing a globally linear latent dynamics. Evaluated on wave data generated by a high-dimensional PDE, KALIKO surpasses several baselines in open-loop prediction and in a demanding closed-loop simulated control task: stabilizing an underactuated manipulator's payload by predicting and compensating for strong wave disturbances.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faKALIKO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u9690\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60Koopman\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u3001\u6df7\u6c8c\u548c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1bKoopman\u7406\u8bba\u867d\u53ef\u5c06\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u663e\u5f0f\u6784\u9020\u5408\u9002\u57fa\u51fd\u6570\u56f0\u96be\u4e14\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u51c6\u6216\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faKalman-Implicit Koopman Operator (KALIKO) \u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Koopman\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\uff0c\u9690\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u72b6\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\u53ca\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u663e\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728PDE\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6ce2\u6d6a\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0cKALIKO\u5728\u5f00\u73af\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u95ed\u73af\u63a7\u5236\uff08\u5982\u6291\u5236\u6b20\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u8f7d\u8377\u53d7\u5f3a\u6ce2\u6270\u52a8\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u91cd\u6784\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u7ebf\u6027\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "conclusion": "KALIKO\u4e3a\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

However, the significant resource requirements of FL often exclude centres with limited computational infrastructure, further widening existing healthcare disparities. To address this issue, we propose a Green AI-oriented adaptive layer-freezing strategy designed to reduce energy consumption and computational load while maintaining model performance. We tested our approach using different federated architectures for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-to-Computed Tomography (CT) conversion. The proposed adaptive strategy optimises the federated training by selectively freezing the encoder weights based on the monitored relative difference of the encoder weights from round to round. A patience-based mechanism ensures that freezing only occurs when updates remain consistently minimal. The energy consumption and CO2eq emissions of the federation were tracked using the CodeCarbon library. Compared to equivalent non-frozen counterparts, our approach reduced training time, total energy consumption and CO2eq emissions by up to 23%. At the same time, the MRI-to-CT conversion performance was maintained, with only small variations in the Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Notably, for three out of the five evaluated architectures, no statistically significant differences were observed, while two architectures exhibited statistically significant improvements. Our work aligns with a research paradigm that promotes DL-based frameworks meeting clinical requirements while ensuring climatic, social, and economic sustainability.

However, this paradigm might incur substantial token overhead, especially when models \"overthink\" by producing lengthy reasoning chains, which can even lead to incorrect answers. A promising direction is the symbolic-solver-integrated approach, which leverages the code generation capabilities of LLMs to translate reasoning tasks into executable code and then solve them with a symbolic solver. In this paper, we explore an open question of when the conventional long-CoT can be enhanced by symbolic solvers. Our experimental results show that the symbolic-solver-integrated method only helps when the problem requires limited implicit reasoning but involves an ample search space. The latest LLMs, like GPT-4o, show better performance on deductive problems with shallow reasoning depth, while the symbolic-solver-integrated method significantly improves the LLMs' performance in constraint satisfaction problems that require repeated backtracks.

Both stages operate in a zero-shot manner, without task-specific training. Because existing datasets lack reliable material annotations, we evaluate our method using an LLM-as-a-Judge implemented in DeepEval. Across 1,000 shapes from Fusion/ABS and ShapeNet, our method achieves high semantic and material plausibility. These results demonstrate that language models can serve as general-purpose priors for bridging geometric reasoning and material understanding in 3D data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u4ece\u5e26\u7c97\u7565\u5206\u5272\u76843D\u70b9\u4e91\u4e2d\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63a8\u65ad\u7269\u4f53\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u5404\u90e8\u5206\u6750\u6599\u7ec4\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u2018\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\u2019\u548c\u2018\u7531\u4ec0\u4e48\u6784\u6210\u2019\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u7528LLM-as-a-Judge\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86LLM\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u6750\u6599\u7406\u89e3\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5148\u9a8c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u5f62\u72b6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u51b3\u5b9a\u5916\u89c2\u7684\u6750\u6599\u5c5e\u6027\uff1b\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6750\u6599\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u96f6\u6837\u672cLLM\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u9884\u6d4b\u7269\u4f53\u6574\u4f53\u8bed\u4e49\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u8bed\u4e49\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u5272\u90e8\u5206\u5206\u914d\u5408\u7406\u6750\u6599\uff1b\u5168\u7a0b\u65e0\u9700\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728Fusion/ABS\u548cShapeNet\u51711000\u4e2a\u5f62\u72b6\u4e0a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7DeepEval\u6784\u5efa\u7684LLM-as-a-Judge\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u6750\u6599\u63a8\u65ad\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u8fde\u63a53D\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u6750\u6599\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u6750\u6599\u611f\u77e5\u76843D\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

These interactions are shaped by inherent differences in strength, and they often lead to stable dominance patterns that emerge surprisingly quickly relative to the size of the population. This motivates the search for simple mathematical models that capture both heterogeneous agent strength and rapid convergence to stable local dominance.\n  A widely studied abstraction of local dominance is the Maximal Independent Set (MIS) problem. In the Luby MIS protocol that provably converges quickly to an MIS, each agent repeatedly generates a strength value chosen uniformly and becomes locally dominant if its value is smaller than those of its neighbors. This provides a theoretical explanation for fast dominance convergence in populations of equal-strength agents and naturally raises the question of whether fast convergence also holds in the more realistic setting where agents are inherently mixed-strength.\n  To investigate this question, we introduce the mixed-strength agents model, in which each agent draws its strength from its own distribution. We prove that the extension of the Luby MIS protocol where each agent repeatedly generates a strength value from its own distribution still exhibits fast dominance convergence, providing formal confirmation of the rapid convergence observed in many mixed-strength natural processes.\n  We also show that heterogeneity can significantly change the dynamics of the process. In contrast to the equal-strength setting, a constant fraction of edges need not be eliminated per round. We construct a population and strength profile in which progress per round is asymptotically smaller, illustrating how inherent strength asymmetry produces qualitatively different global behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0cLuby MIS\u534f\u8bae\u662f\u5426\u4ecd\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5c40\u90e8\u652f\u914d\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5bf9\u8fc7\u7a0b\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bb8\u591a\u81ea\u7136\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee3\u7406\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u7ade\u4e89\u5f62\u6210\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u652f\u914d\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u79cd\u6a21\u5f0f\u5f80\u5f80\u6bd4\u79cd\u7fa4\u89c4\u6a21\u66f4\u5feb\u5730\u51fa\u73b0\u3002\u8fd9\u4fc3\u4f7f\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5bfb\u627e\u65e2\u80fd\u4f53\u73b0\u4ee3\u7406\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u53c8\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u6570\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6df7\u5408\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u4ece\u81ea\u8eab\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u62bd\u53d6\u5f3a\u5ea6\u503c\uff1b\u6269\u5c55Luby MIS\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u4f7f\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u6309\u81ea\u8eab\u5206\u5e03\u91cd\u590d\u751f\u6210\u5f3a\u5ea6\u503c\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5206\u6790\u5176\u6536\u655b\u6027\u53ca\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6269\u5c55\u540e\u7684Luby MIS\u534f\u8bae\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u4ecd\u5177\u6709\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u6bcf\u8f6e\u6d88\u9664\u7684\u8fb9\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4e0d\u518d\u6052\u5b9a\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u9020\u51fa\u6e10\u8fdb\u66f4\u6162\u8fdb\u5c55\u7684\u4f8b\u5b50\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df7\u5408\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0bLuby MIS\u534f\u8bae\u4f9d\u7136\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u754c\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u652f\u914d\u73b0\u8c61\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u652f\u6301\uff1b\u4f46\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5168\u5c40\u884c\u4e3a\u53d1\u751f\u8d28\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u7b80\u5355\u6cbf\u7528\u7b49\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002"}}

In this paper, we introduce Grasped Object Manifold Projection (GOMP), an interactive method that mitigates these errors by constraining a non-rigidly grasped object to a lower-dimensional manifold. GOMP assumes a precise task in which a manipulator holds an object that may shift within the grasp in an observable manner and must be mated with a grounded part. Crucially, all GOMP enhancements are learned from the same expert dataset used to train the base IL policy, and are adjusted with an n-arm bandit-based interactive component. We propose a theoretical basis for GOMP's improvement upon the well-known compounding error bound in IL literature. We demonstrate the framework on four precise assembly tasks using tactile feedback, and note that the approach remains modality-agnostic.

While 3D coronary artery digital twins reconstructed from imaging offer detailed anatomy for personalized assessment, their analysis relies on computationally intensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD), limiting scalability. Data-driven approaches are hindered by scarce labeled data and lack of physiological priors. To address this, we present PINS-CAD, a physics-informed self-supervised learning framework. It pre-trains graph neural networks on 200,000 synthetic coronary digital twins to predict pressure and flow, guided by 1D Navier-Stokes equations and pressure-drop laws, eliminating the need for CFD or labeled data. When fine-tuned on clinical data from 635 patients in the multicenter FAME2 study, PINS-CAD predicts future cardiovascular events with an AUC of 0.73, outperforming clinical risk scores and data-driven baselines. This demonstrates that physics-informed pretraining boosts sample efficiency and yields physiologically meaningful representations. Furthermore, PINS-CAD generates spatially resolved pressure and fractional flow reserve curves, providing interpretable biomarkers.

Project page: https://waabi.ai/flux4d/", "summary": "Reconstructing large-scale dynamic scenes from visual observations is a fundamental challenge in computer vision, with critical implications for robotics and autonomous systems. While recent differentiable rendering methods such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved impressive photorealistic reconstruction, they suffer from scalability limitations and require annotations to decouple actor motion. Existing self-supervised methods attempt to eliminate explicit annotations by leveraging motion cues and geometric priors, yet they remain constrained by per-scene optimization and sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, we introduce Flux4D, a simple and scalable framework for 4D reconstruction of large-scale dynamic scenes. Flux4D directly predicts 3D Gaussians and their motion dynamics to reconstruct sensor observations in a fully unsupervised manner. By adopting only photometric losses and enforcing an \"as static as possible\" regularization, Flux4D learns to decompose dynamic elements directly from raw data without requiring pre-trained supervised models or foundational priors simply by training across many scenes. Our approach enables efficient reconstruction of dynamic scenes within seconds, scales effectively to large datasets, and generalizes well to unseen environments, including rare and unknown objects. Experiments on outdoor driving datasets show Flux4D significantly outperforms existing methods in scalability, generalization, and reconstruction quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFlux4D\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u76d1\u7763\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u76844D\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b3D\u9ad8\u65af\u53ca\u5176\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5728\u4ec5\u7528\u5149\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u548c\u2018\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u9759\u6001\u2019\u6b63\u5219\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u573a\u666f\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709NeRF\u548c3DGS\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u53ca\u5bf9\u8fd0\u52a8\u89e3\u8026\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff1b\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u9700\u9010\u573a\u666f\u4f18\u5316\u4e14\u8d85\u53c2\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u672a\u89c1\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "Flux4D\u91c7\u7528\u5168\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b3D\u9ad8\u65af\u53c2\u6570\u53ca\u5176\u8fd0\u52a8\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5149\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u548c\u2018\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u9759\u6001\u2019\uff08as static as possible\uff09\u6b63\u5219\u9879\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u591a\u573a\u666f\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6237\u5916\u9a7e\u9a76\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cFlux4D\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u66f4\u9ad8\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb\u81f3\u79d2\u7ea7\u3001\u652f\u6301\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u81f3\u672a\u77e5\u73af\u5883\u53ca\u7f55\u89c1\u7269\u4f53\u3002", "conclusion": "Flux4D\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4ec5\u9760\u7b80\u5355\u635f\u5931\u548c\u8de8\u573a\u666f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u76844D\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u89c6\u89c9\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

The exploitative drive, or what an agent wants to achieve, is formalised as the Kullback-Leibler divergence between a variational probability distribution, updated at each inference step, and a preference probability distribution that indicates what states or observations are more likely for the agent, hence determining the agent's goal in a certain environment. In the literature, the questions of how the preference distribution should be specified and of how a certain specification impacts inference and learning in an active inference agent have been given hardly any attention. In this work, we consider four possible ways of defining the preference distribution, either providing the agents with hard or soft goals and either involving or not goal shaping (i.e., intermediate goals). We compare the performances of four agents, each given one of the possible preference distributions, in a grid world navigation task. Our results show that goal shaping enables the best performance overall (i.e., it promotes exploitation) while sacrificing learning about the environment's transition dynamics (i.e., it hampers exploration).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u504f\u597d\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u56db\u79cd\u5b9a\u4e49\u65b9\u5f0f\u5bf9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u76ee\u6807\u5851\u9020\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u4f46\u4f1a\u524a\u5f31\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5f88\u5c11\u5173\u6ce8\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u504f\u597d\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u8bbe\u5b9a\u65b9\u5f0f\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u63a8\u65ad\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u56db\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u504f\u597d\u5206\u5e03\u5b9a\u4e49\uff08\u786c/\u8f6f\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u662f\u5426\u5305\u542b\u76ee\u6807\u5851\u9020\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u7f51\u683c\u4e16\u754c\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u76ee\u6807\u5851\u9020\u5e26\u6765\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5229\u7528\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u635f\u5bb3\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u8f6c\u79fb\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u6291\u5236\u63a2\u7d22\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u504f\u597d\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9700\u6743\u8861\u5229\u7528\u4e0e\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u5851\u9020\u867d\u63d0\u5347\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5374\u4ee5\u727a\u7272\u73af\u5883\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u4e3a\u4ee3\u4ef7\u3002"}}

Using large language models, we automatically labeled topic, genre, and discourse-pragmatic functions across a total of 3,691 code-switched sentences, integrated demographic metadata from the Miami Bilingual Corpus, and enriched the Spanish-Guaran\u00ed dataset with new topic annotations.

Each agent observes complementary but incomplete views of a symbolic puzzle and must exchange messages to solve it cooperatively. Using a diverse set of current-generation and open-source LLMs, we show that (i) strong models such as GPT-5 and Claude-4.0 reliably converge across puzzle sizes on the solution by sharing complete information in two turns, (ii) weaker models often ignore partner messages or over-correct their hypotheses, and (iii) feedback design is non-trivial: simple self-feedback improves success rates, while detailed joint feedback can hurt performance.

Recent advances in map data structures and spatial indexing have significantly improved the efficiency of LIO systems. Nevertheless, we observe that two aspects may still leave room for improvement: (1) nearest neighbor search often requires examining multiple spatial units to gather sufficient points for plane fitting, and (2) plane parameters are typically recomputed at every iteration despite unchanged map geometry. Motivated by these observations, we propose Surfel-LIO, which employs a hierarchical voxel structure (hVox) with pre-computed surfel representation. This design enables O(1) correspondence retrieval without runtime neighbor enumeration or plane fitting, combined with Z-order curve encoding for cache-friendly spatial indexing. Experimental results on the M3DGR dataset demonstrate that our method achieves significantly faster processing speed compared to recent state-of-the-art methods while maintaining comparable state estimation accuracy.

However, these adaptation components are tightly coupled to a specific base model, making them difficult to reuse when the base model is upgraded (e.g., from SD 1.x to 2.x) due to substantial changes in model parameters and architecture. In this work, we propose Delta Sampling (DS), a novel method that enables knowledge transfer across base models with different architectures, without requiring access to the original training data. DS operates entirely at inference time by leveraging the delta: the difference in model predictions before and after the adaptation of a base model. This delta is then used to guide the denoising process of a new base model. We evaluate DS across various SD versions, demonstrating that DS achieves consistent improvements in creating desired effects (e.g., visual styles, semantic concepts, and structures) under different sampling strategies. These results highlight DS as an effective, plug-and-play mechanism for knowledge transfer in diffusion-based image synthesis.

These interactions represent a critical frontier for LLM-based agents, yet existing evaluation methods fail to measure how well these capabilities generalize to novel social situations. In this paper, we introduce a method for evaluating the ability of LLM-based agents to cooperate in zero-shot, mixed-motive environments using Concordia, a natural language multi-agent simulation environment. Our method measures general cooperative intelligence by testing an agent's ability to identify and exploit opportunities for mutual gain across diverse partners and contexts. We present empirical results from the NeurIPS 2024 Concordia Contest, where agents were evaluated on their ability to achieve mutual gains across a suite of diverse scenarios ranging from negotiation to collective action problems. Our findings reveal significant gaps between current agent capabilities and the robust generalization required for reliable cooperation, particularly in scenarios demanding persuasion and norm enforcement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u52a8\u673a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4ee3\u7406\u5408\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eConcordia\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4eff\u771f\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7NeurIPS 2024 Concordia\u7ade\u8d5b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524dLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u8bf4\u670d\u4e0e\u89c4\u8303\u6267\u884c\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u5408\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u8861\u91cfLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u65b0\u9896\u793e\u4f1a\u60c5\u5883\u4e2d\u5408\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u6b63\u65e5\u76ca\u6d89\u53ca\u4eba\u673a\u53ca\u673a\u673a\u6df7\u5408\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1\u771f\u5b9e\u793e\u4f1a\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8eConcordia\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5408\u4f5c\u667a\u80fd\u8bc4\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4f19\u4f34\u4e0e\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u8c08\u5224\u3001\u96c6\u4f53\u884c\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\uff09\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ee3\u7406\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e92\u60e0\u6536\u76ca\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "NeurIPS 2024 Concordia\u7ade\u8d5b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f53\u524dLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u591a\u6570\u5408\u4f5c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9700\u8bf4\u670d\u4e0e\u89c4\u8303\u6267\u884c\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u660e\u663e\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u51fa\u5408\u4f5c\u667a\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u77ed\u677f\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\u5c1a\u672a\u8fbe\u5230\u53ef\u9760\u90e8\u7f72\u6240\u9700\u6c34\u5e73\uff1b\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u805a\u7126\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u5f02\u6784\u793e\u4f1a\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u4e0e\u534f\u8c03\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

These personas represent different levels of medical literacy and information needs, emphasizing the need for targeted, audience-specific summarization. Each summary in PERCS was reviewed by physicians for factual accuracy and persona alignment using a detailed error taxonomy. Technical validation shows clear differences in readability, vocabulary, and content depth across personas. Along with describing the dataset, we benchmark four large language models on PERCS using automatic evaluation metrics that assess comprehensiveness, readability, and faithfulness, establishing baseline results for future research.

From Geometric to Foundation Models", "comment": null, "summary": "In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of existing scene representation methods for robotics, covering traditional representations such as point clouds, voxels, signed distance functions (SDF), and scene graphs, as well as more recent neural representations like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), and the emerging Foundation Models. While current SLAM and localization systems predominantly rely on sparse representations like point clouds and voxels, dense scene representations are expected to play a critical role in downstream tasks such as navigation and obstacle avoidance. Moreover, neural representations such as NeRF, 3DGS, and foundation models are well-suited for integrating high-level semantic features and language-based priors, enabling more comprehensive 3D scene understanding and embodied intelligence. In this paper, we categorized the core modules of robotics into five parts (Perception, Mapping, Localization, Navigation, Manipulation). We start by presenting the standard formulation of different scene representation methods and comparing the advantages and disadvantages of scene representation across different modules. This survey is centered around the question: What is the best 3D scene representation for robotics? We then discuss the future development trends of 3D scene representations, with a particular focus on how the 3D Foundation Model could replace current methods as the unified solution for future robotic applications.

To this end, we analyze the dynamical system governing the continuous-time limit of the pre-trained model and characterize the asymptotic behavior of its solutions. Specifically, we characterize when tokens move closer to or farther from one another over time, depending on the model parameters. We provide sufficient conditions, based on these parameters, to identify scenarios where tokens either converge to zero or diverge to infinity. Unlike prior works, our conditions are broader in scope and more applicable to real-world models. Furthermore, we investigate how different forms of positional encoding -- specifically absolute and rotary -- affect these dynamical regimes. Empirical evidence reveals that the convergence scenario adversely impacts model performance. Motivated by these insights, we propose simple refinements to Transformer architectures that mitigate convergence behavior in models with absolute or rotary positional encoding. These findings support theoretical foundations and design principles for improving Transformer models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u4e2dtoken\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5224\u65adtoken\u6536\u655b\u6216\u53d1\u6563\u7684\u5145\u5206\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\uff08\u7edd\u5bf9\u4e0e\u65cb\u8f6c\uff09\u5bf9\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u7b80\u5355\u67b6\u6784\u6539\u8fdb\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u6709\u5bb3\u7684\u6536\u655b\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u5bf9Transformer\u4e2dtoken\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u666e\u9002\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u67d0\u4e9b\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\uff08\u5982token\u6536\u655b\uff09\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u52a0\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3Transformer\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u523b\u753btoken\u95f4\u8ddd\u79bb\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\u63a8\u5bfc\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u7684token\u6536\u655b\u81f3\u96f6\u6216\u53d1\u6563\u81f3\u65e0\u7a77\u7684\u5145\u5206\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b\u6bd4\u8f83\u7edd\u5bf9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u4e0e\u65cb\u8f6c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u5bf9\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u7406\u8bba\u53d1\u73b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u67b6\u6784\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u3001\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684token\u6536\u655b/\u53d1\u6563\u5224\u636e\uff1b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u53d1\u73b0token\u6536\u655b\u60c5\u5f62\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u6539\u8fdb\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u7edd\u5bf9\u548c\u65cb\u8f6c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u5bb3\u6536\u655b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "Transformer\u4e2dtoken\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u6df1\u523b\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u8c03\u6574\u53ef\u7a33\u5065\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\uff1b\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aTransformer\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u539f\u5219\u3002"}}

Richer rewards computed from the reasoning tokens can improve learning significantly by providing more fine-grained guidance. However, it is challenging to compute more informative rewards in MMRL beyond those based on outcomes since different samples may require different scoring functions and teacher models may provide noisy reward signals too. In this paper, we introduce the Argos (Agentic Reward for Grounded & Objective Scoring), a principled reward agent to train multimodal reasoning models for agentic tasks. For each sample, Argos selects from a pool of teacher-model derived and rule-based scoring functions to simultaneously evaluate: (i) final response accuracy, (ii) spatiotemporal localization of referred entities and actions, and (iii) the quality of the reasoning process. We find that by leveraging our agentic verifier across both SFT data curation and RL training, our model achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple agentic tasks such as spatial reasoning, visual hallucination as well as robotics and embodied AI benchmarks. Critically, we demonstrate that just relying on SFT post-training on highly curated reasoning data is insufficient, as agents invariably collapse to ungrounded solutions during RL without our online verification. We also show that our agentic verifier can help to reduce reward-hacking in MMRL. Finally, we also provide a theoretical justification for the effectiveness of Argos through the concept of pareto-optimality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faArgos\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5bf9\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u3001\u65f6\u7a7a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u53ca\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u53ca\u5177\u8eabAI\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u591a\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u578b\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6307\u5bfc\uff1b\u800c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u9762\u4e34\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u56f0\u96be\u548c\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u566a\u58f0\u5e72\u6270\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faArgos\u5956\u52b1\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u4ece\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u884d\u751f\u4e0e\u89c4\u5219\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u6c60\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u540c\u6b65\u8bc4\u4f30\u54cd\u5e94\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u65f6\u7a7a\u5b9e\u4f53/\u52a8\u4f5c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8d28\u91cf\u4ee5\u53ca\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u5e76\u5c06\u8be5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u6570\u636e\u7b5b\u9009\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u5168\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u5e7b\u89c9\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0e\u5177\u8eabAI\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\uff1b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4ec5\u9760\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cfSFT\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u6cd5\u907f\u514dRL\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u5931\u6548\uff1b\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3MMRL\u4e2d\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u4f5c\u5f0a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "Argos\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3001\u5728\u7ebf\u5316\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u7406\u8bba\u53ef\u652f\u6491\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u8def\u5f84\uff1b\u5f3a\u8c03\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u76d1\u7763\u4e0e\u7ed3\u679c\u76d1\u7763\u540c\u7b49\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce the Idea-Gated Transformer, a novel architecture that separates semantic planning from syntactic generation. We introduce an auxiliary ``Idea Head'' trained to predict the bag-of-words distribution for a future context window, creating a latent ``Concept Vector'' that actively gates the main vocabulary during generation. We propose a differentiable gating mechanism that suppresses semantically irrelevant tokens, effectively pruning the search space in real-time. Experiments on WikiText-103 demonstrate that while the Idea-Gated model achieves comparable validation perplexity to a standard GPT-2 baseline, it exhibits significantly superior Domain Retention. Qualitative and quantitative analysis reveals that the gating mechanism successfully locks generation into specific semantic clusters (e.g., Finance, Science) and resists associative drift, offering a parameter-efficient path toward more controllable language modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faIdea-Gated Transformer\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u2018Idea Head\u2019\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5e03\u5e76\u52a8\u6001\u95e8\u63a7\u8bcd\u6c47\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e3b\u9898\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9886\u57df\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0b\u4e00\u8bcd\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u4e0b\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u4e3b\u9898\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u4f9d\u8d56\u5c40\u90e8\u5173\u8054\u800c\u975e\u5168\u5c40\u8bed\u4e49\u89c4\u5212\uff1b\u6269\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4ec5\u90e8\u5206\u7f13\u89e3\uff0c\u6839\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u4e8eNTP\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u77ed\u89c6\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1Idea-Gated Transformer\uff1a\u65b0\u589eIdea Head\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u7a97\u53e3\u7684\u8bcd\u888b\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u751f\u6210Concept Vector\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u53ef\u5fae\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u65f6\u6291\u5236\u8bed\u4e49\u65e0\u5173\u8bcd\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u8bed\u4e49\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u53e5\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728WikiText-103\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u4e0eGPT-2\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4f46Domain Retention\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u4f18\uff1b\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u9501\u5b9a\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u4e49\u7c07\uff08\u5982\u91d1\u878d\u3001\u79d1\u5b66\uff09\u5e76\u62b5\u6297\u8054\u60f3\u6f02\u79fb\u3002", "conclusion": "Idea-Gated\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e3b\u9898\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper presents a novel model-based RL framework built on top of the DreamerV3 algorithm, integrating a Multi-Layer Perceptron Variational Autoencoder (MLP-VAE) within a world model to encode high-dimensional LIDAR readings into compact latent representations. These latent features, combined with a learned dynamics predictor, enable efficient imagination-based policy optimization. Experiments on simulated TurtleBot3 navigation tasks demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves faster convergence and higher success rate compared to model-free baselines such as SAC, DDPG, and TD3. It is worth emphasizing that the DreamerV3-based agent attains a 100% success rate across all evaluated environments when using the full dataset of the Turtlebot3 LIDAR (360 readings), while model-free methods plateaued below 85%.

In this paper, we propose a safe Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning (HDRL) framework for solving the EB Charging Scheduling Problem (EBCSP) under multi-source uncertainties.

At the low level, we incorporate MAPPO-Lagrangian to learn decentralized charging power decisions under the Centralized Training and Decentralized Execution (CTDE) paradigm.

Learning-based denoisers have the potential to reconstruct high-quality images. For training, however, these denoisers require large paired datasets of clean and noisy images, which are difficult to collect. Noise synthesis is an alternative to large-scale data acquisition: given a clean image, we can synthesize a realistic noisy counterpart. In this work, we propose a general and practical noise synthesis method that requires only one single noisy image and one single dark frame per ISO setting. We represent signal-dependent noise with a Poisson distribution and introduce a Fourier-domain spectral sampling algorithm to accurately model signal-independent noise.

Despite the remarkable progress of large language models (LLMs), most current approaches still rely on forward reasoning paradigms, generating step-by-step rationales from premises to conclusions. However, such methods often suffer from redundant inference paths, hallucinated steps, and semantic drift, resulting in inefficient and unreliable reasoning. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Hypothesis-driven Backward Logical Reasoning (HBLR). The core idea is to integrate confidence-aware symbolic translation with hypothesis-driven backward reasoning. In the translation phase, only high-confidence spans are converted into logical form, such as First-Order Logic (FOL), while uncertain content remains in natural language. A translation reflection module further ensures semantic fidelity by evaluating symbolic outputs and reverting lossy ones back to text when necessary. In the reasoning phase, HBLR simulates human deductive thinking by assuming the conclusion is true and recursively verifying its premises. A reasoning reflection module further identifies and corrects flawed inference steps, enhancing logical coherence. Extensive experiments on five reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that HBLR consistently outperforms strong baselines in both accuracy and efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5047\u8bbe\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u53cd\u5411\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff08HBLR\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u5316\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e0e\u53cd\u5411\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u524d\u5411\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u5197\u4f59\u8def\u5f84\u3001\u5e7b\u89c9\u6b65\u9aa4\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u4f4e\u6548\u4e14\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "method": "HBLR\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a1\uff09\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff08\u4ec5\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6587\u672c\u8f6c\u4e3a\u4e00\u9636\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u8f85\u4ee5\u7ffb\u8bd1\u53cd\u601d\u6a21\u5757\u4fdd\u969c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u5047\u8bbe\u7ed3\u8bba\u4e3a\u771f\u3001\u9012\u5f52\u9a8c\u8bc1\u524d\u63d0\u7684\u53cd\u5411\u63a8\u7406\uff08\u8f85\u4ee5\u63a8\u7406\u53cd\u601d\u6a21\u5757\u4fee\u6b63\u9519\u8bef\u6b65\u9aa4\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cHBLR\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "HBLR\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u6f14\u7ece\u601d\u7ef4\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u91cd\u53cd\u601d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Leveraging MotionGeneralizer, we collect 3.5M trajectories to train and evaluate MpiNetsFusion against state-of-the-art planners, which shows that the proposed MpiNetsFusion can plan several times faster on the evaluated tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPerFACT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542bMotionGeneralizer\uff08\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ee5\u6269\u5145\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff09\u548cMpiNetsFusion\uff08\u878d\u5408\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u5757Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u901a\u7528\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\uff0c\u57283.5M\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u89c4\u5212\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u4eba\u5de5\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u4e14\u5355\u4f53\u7f51\u7edc\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u7f16\u7801\u5173\u952e\u89c4\u5212\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMotionGeneralizer\uff08LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u548cMpiNetsFusion\uff08\u878d\u5408\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u5757Transformer\u7684\u901a\u7528\u89c4\u5212\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u524d\u8005\u5408\u62103.5M\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "MpiNetsFusion\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u89c4\u5212\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb\u6570\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408Transformer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u795e\u7ecf\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

However, the inherent latent compression often introduces pixel-level inconsistencies, such as chromatic shifts, texture mismatches, and visible seams along editing boundaries. Existing remedies, including background-conditioned latent decoding and pixel-space harmonization, usually fail to fully eliminate these artifacts in practice and do not generalize well across different latent representations or tasks. We introduce PixPerfect, a pixel-level refinement framework that delivers seamless, high-fidelity local edits across diverse LDM architectures and tasks. PixPerfect leverages (i) a differentiable discriminative pixel space that amplifies and suppresses subtle color and texture discrepancies, (ii) a comprehensive artifact simulation pipeline that exposes the refiner to realistic local editing artifacts during training, and (iii) a direct pixel-space refinement scheme that ensures broad applicability across diverse latent representations and tasks. Extensive experiments on inpainting, object removal, and insertion benchmarks demonstrate that PixPerfect substantially enhances perceptual fidelity and downstream editing performance, establishing a new standard for robust and high-fidelity localized image editing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPixPerfect\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316\u5904\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08LDMs\uff09\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2d\u56e0\u6f5c\u5728\u538b\u7f29\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8272\u5f69\u504f\u79fb\u3001\u7eb9\u7406\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u53ef\u89c1\u7f1d\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7f16\u8f91\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "Latent Diffusion Models\uff08LDMs\uff09\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2d\u867d\u53d6\u5f97\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u538b\u7f29\u5e38\u5f15\u53d1\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff08\u5982\u8272\u504f\u3001\u7eb9\u7406\u9519\u914d\u3001\u8fb9\u754c\u4f2a\u5f71\uff09\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u80cc\u666f\u6761\u4ef6\u89e3\u7801\u3001\u50cf\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4\u8c03\u548c\uff09\u96be\u4ee5\u5f7b\u5e95\u6d88\u9664\u4e14\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5dee\u3002", "method": "PixPerfect\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\uff1a(i) \u53ef\u5fae\u5224\u522b\u6027\u50cf\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a/\u6291\u5236\u7ec6\u5fae\u989c\u8272\u4e0e\u7eb9\u7406\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b(ii) \u5168\u9762\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u4f2a\u5f71\u6a21\u62df\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7cbe\u70bc\u5668\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u63a5\u89e6\u771f\u5b9e\u7f16\u8f91\u4f2a\u5f71\uff1b(iii) \u76f4\u63a5\u50cf\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4\u7cbe\u70bc\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u3001\u7269\u4f53\u79fb\u9664\u4e0e\u63d2\u5165\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cPixPerfect\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u7f16\u8f91\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5c40\u90e8\u7f16\u8f91\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "PixPerfect\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8eLDM\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u7cbe\u70bc\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u786e\u7acb\u4e86\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u65b0\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

PARC is built on a hierarchical multi-agent architecture incorporating task planning, execution, and a mechanism that evaluates its own actions and their outcomes from an independent context and provides feedback, namely self-assessment and self-feedback. This design enables PARC to detect and correct high-level strategic errors and sustain progress without human intervention. We evaluate PARC across computational science and data science tasks. In materials science, it autonomously reproduces key results from studies on lithium-ion conduction and alloy segregation.

We enforce a parameter-efficient weight-sharing strategy across recursive steps, ensuring that this enhanced expressivity incurs $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ additional parameters.

However, when performing global localization using semantic objects, high semantic ambiguity intensifies object misclassification and increases the likelihood of incorrect associations, which in turn can cause significant errors in the estimated pose. Thus, in this letter, we propose a multi-label likelihood-based semantic graph matching framework for object-level global localization. The key idea is to exploit multi-label graph representations, rather than single-label alternatives, to capture and leverage the inherent semantic context of object observations. Based on these representations, our approach enhances semantic correspondence across graphs by combining the likelihood of each node with the maximum likelihood of its neighbors via context-aware likelihood propagation. For rigorous validation, data association and pose estimation performance are evaluated under both closed-set and open-set detection configurations.

Using data from NASA's MODIS/ASTER Airborne Simulator (MASTER), which is similar to a next-generation fire detection sensor, we compare accuracy, inference latency, and resource efficiency.\n  Experimental results show that the proposed two-stage pipeline achieves strong trade-offs between speed and accuracy, demonstrating significant potential for real-time edge deployment in future wildfire monitoring missions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aPyroFocus\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60 pipeline\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u8f7d\u5b9e\u65f6 wildfire \u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u706b\u8f90\u5c04\u529f\u7387\uff08FRP\uff09\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5728MASTER\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u8fb9\u7f18\u90e8\u7f72\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": " wildfires \u9891\u53d1\u4e14\u52a0\u5267\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u7684\u673a\u8f7d\u5b9e\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u9ad8\u7ef4\u591a/\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u70ed\u6210\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u5728\u661f\u8f7d/\u673a\u8f7d\u5e73\u53f0\u5b9e\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u9762\u4e34\u7b97\u529b\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49CNN\u4e0eTransformer\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faPyroFocus\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5pipeline\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u591a\u7c7b\u706b\u707e\u5206\u7c7b\uff08\u65e0\u706b/\u7740\u706b/\u8fc7\u706b\uff09\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5FRP\u56de\u5f52\u6216\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5ef6\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u4f7f\u7528NASA MASTER\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u8bc4\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "PyroFocus\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5b9e\u65f6\u8fb9\u7f18\u90e8\u7f72\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u67b6\u6784\u662f\u9762\u5411\u672a\u6765 wildfire \u76d1\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u673a\u8f7d\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u65f6\u6548\u6027\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u9065\u611f\u706b\u707e\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

This struggle is driven by two main limitations. First, single-agent architectures enforce a monolithic plan-execute loop, which directly causes trajectory instability. Second, the requirement to use local open-weight models for data privacy introduces smaller context windows leading to the rapid consumption of context from large tool outputs. To solve this problem we introduce RP-ReAct (Reasoner Planner-ReAct), a novel multi-agent approach that fundamentally decouples strategic planning from low-level execution to achieve superior reliability and efficiency. RP-ReAct consists of a Reasoner Planner Agent (RPA), responsible for planning each sub-step, continuously analysing the execution results using the strong reasoning capabilities of a Large Reasoning Model, and one or multiple Proxy-Execution Agent (PEA) that translates sub-steps into concrete tool interactions using a ReAct approach. Crucially, we incorporate a context-saving strategy within the PEA to mitigate context window overflow by managing large tool outputs via external storage and on-demand access. We evaluate RP-ReAct, on the challenging, multi-domain ToolQA benchmark using a diverse set of six open-weight reasoning models. Our empirical results show that RP-ReAct achieves superior performance and improved generalization ability over state-of-the-art baselines when addressing diverse complex tasks across the evaluated domains. Furthermore we establish the enhanced robustness and stability of our approach across different model scales, paving the way for effective and deployable agentic solutions for enterprises.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faRP-ReAct\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u9ad8\u5c42\u89c4\u5212\uff08Reasoner Planner Agent\uff09\u4e0e\u5e95\u5c42\u6267\u884c\uff08Proxy-Execution Agent\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8282\u7701\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u67b6\u6784\u5b58\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u672c\u5730\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u5c0f\u5bfc\u81f4\u5de5\u5177\u8f93\u51fa\u8fc5\u901f\u8017\u5c3d\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u4f01\u4e1a\u4e2d\u9700\u534f\u8c03\u591a\u5de5\u5177\u3001\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u7684\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRP-ReAct\uff1a\u7531\u5177\u5907\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684Reasoner Planner Agent\u8d1f\u8d23\u5206\u6b65\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u7ed3\u679c\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u4e00\u4e2a\u6216\u591a\u4e2a\u91c7\u7528ReAct\u8303\u5f0f\u7684Proxy-Execution Agent\u8d1f\u8d23\u5177\u4f53\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5916\u90e8\u5b58\u50a8+\u6309\u9700\u52a0\u8f7d\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8282\u7701\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6ea2\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u9886\u57dfToolQA\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f7f\u75286\u79cd\u5f00\u6e90\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cRP-ReAct\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5747\u4f18\u4e8eSOTA\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "RP-ReAct\u901a\u8fc7\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u6267\u884c\u89e3\u8026\u53ca\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u9690\u79c1\u654f\u611f\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We introduce ATHENA (Agentic Team for Hierarchical Evolutionary Numerical Algorithms), an agentic framework designed as an Autonomous Lab to manage the end-to-end computational research lifecycle. Its core is the HENA loop, a knowledge-driven diagnostic process framed as a Contextual Bandit problem. Acting as an online learner, the system analyzes prior trials to select structural `actions' ($A_n$) from combinatorial spaces guided by expert blueprints (e.g., Universal Approximation, Physics-Informed constraints). These actions are translated into executable code ($S_n$) to generate scientific rewards ($R_n$). ATHENA transcends standard automation: in SciC, it autonomously identifies mathematical symmetries for exact analytical solutions or derives stable numerical solvers where foundation models fail. In SciML, it performs deep diagnosis to tackle ill-posed formulations and combines hybrid symbolic-numeric workflows (e.g., coupling PINNs with FEM) to resolve multiphysics problems.

H$^2$U3D features multi-floor environments spanning up to three floors and 10-20 rooms, covering more than 300 m$^2$. Through an automated annotation pipeline, it constructs hierarchical coarse-to-fine visual representations and generates diverse question-answer pairs with chain-of-thought annotations. We further propose SpatialReasoner, an active perception framework that autonomously invokes spatial tools to explore 3D scenes based on textual queries. SpatialReasoner is trained through a two-stage strategy: a supervised cold start followed by reinforcement learning with an adaptive exploration reward that promotes efficient exploration while discouraging redundant operations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpatialReasoner achieves state-of-the-art performance on H$^2$U3D, outperforming strong baselines including GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Pro.

Current approaches to agent programming often entangle two aspects of agent design: the core workflow logic and the inference-time strategy (e.g., tree search). We introduce \"probabilistic angelic nondeterminism\" (\"PAN\"), a programming model that disentangles these two concerns, allowing the programmer to describe the agent workflow and independently experiment with different inference-time strategies by simply changing a few inputs. We provide an implementation of PAN in Python as the EnCompass framework, which uses a Python decorator to compile agent workflow programs into a search space. We present three case studies that demonstrate how the framework lets the programmer quickly improve the reliability of an agent and easily switch between different inference-time strategies, all with little additional coding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7f16\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\u2014\u2014'\u6982\u7387\u5929\u4f7f\u5f0f\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027'\uff08PAN\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u903b\u8f91\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728EnCompass\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7f16\u7a0b\u5e38\u5c06\u6838\u5fc3\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u903b\u8f91\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982\u6811\u641c\u7d22\uff09\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8c03\u8bd5\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u5207\u6362\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u89e3\u8026\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPAN\u7f16\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528Python\u88c5\u9970\u5668\u5c06\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7f16\u8bd1\u4e3a\u53ef\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efaEnCompass\u6846\u67b6\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u4e09\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5728\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u7075\u6d3b\u5207\u6362\u4e0d\u540c\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "PAN\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u5176EnCompass\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u8026\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7f16\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, the model trained based on LoRA often has an unsatisfactory performance due to its low-rank assumption. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Dual LoRA to improve the performance by incorporating an inductive bias into the original LoRA. Specifically, we separate low-rank matrices into two groups: the magnitude group to control whether or not and how far we should update a parameter and the direction group to decide whether this parameter should move forward or backward, to better simulate the parameter updating process of the full fine-tuning based on gradient-based optimization algorithms. We show that this can be simply achieved by adding a ReLU function to the magnitude group and a sign function to the direction group. We conduct several experiments over a wide range of NLP tasks, including natural language generation (NLG), understanding (NLU), and commonsense reasoning datasets on GPT-2, RoBERTa, DeBERTa, and LLaMA-1/2/3 as baseline models.

Drawing on Kripke semantics, we introduce specialized neurons for the modal operators $\\Box$ and $\\Diamond$ that operate over a set of possible worlds, enabling the framework to act as a differentiable ``logical guardrail.'' The architecture is highly flexible: the accessibility relation between worlds can either be fixed by the user to enforce known rules or, as an inductive feature, be parameterized by a neural network. This allows the model to optionally learn the relational structure of a logical system from data while simultaneously performing deductive reasoning within that structure.\n  This versatile construction is designed for flexibility. The entire framework is differentiable from end to end, with learning driven by minimizing a logical contradiction loss. This not only makes the system resilient to inconsistent knowledge but also enables it to learn nonlinear relationships that can help define the logic of a problem space. We illustrate MLNNs on four case studies: grammatical guardrailing, axiomatic detection of the unknown, multi-agent epistemic trust, and detecting constructive deception in natural language negotiation.

We validate the feasibility of applying our method in simulation and real-world environments, demonstrating efficient controller development and migration while accurately controlling UAV position and attitude, exhibiting outstanding trajectory tracking and reduced vibrations during the transition process.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8026\u5408\u5f0f\u8fc7\u6e21\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08ST3M\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u5de1\u822a\u6a21\u5f0f\u89c6\u4e3a\u60ac\u505c\u7684\u7279\u4f8b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86VTOL\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u503e\u8f6c\u65cb\u7ffc\u8fc7\u6e21\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u56e0\u8d28\u5fc3\u548c\u63a8\u529b\u65b9\u5411\u53d8\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u632f\u52a8\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u89e3\u8026\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5747\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3001\u632f\u52a8\u5c0f\u3001\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u5f3a\u3002", "motivation": "VTOL\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u503e\u8f6c\u65cb\u7ffc\u8fc7\u6e21\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u56e0\u8d28\u5fc3\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u63a8\u529b\u65b9\u5411\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u8026\u5f0f\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u63a7\u5236\u5bfc\u81f4\u663e\u8457\u632f\u52a8\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u4e0e\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u7684\u8026\u5408\u5f0f\u8fc7\u6e21\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5ST3M\uff0c\u6452\u5f03\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u8fc7\u6e21\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u5c06\u5de1\u822a\u6a21\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u60ac\u505c\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u60c5\u5f62\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7edf\u4e00\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6210\u529f\uff1a\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u8de8\u5e73\u53f0\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u5f3a\uff0c\u80fd\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0e\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u8fc7\u6e21\u8fc7\u7a0b\u632f\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "ST3M\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u8026\u5408\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u6a21\u5f0f\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86VTOL\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8fc7\u6e21\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u81ea\u4e3b\u8fc7\u6e21\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Traditionally, high-definition (HD) maps are providing this representation of the static road infrastructure to the autonomous system a priori. However, because the real world is constantly changing, such maps must be constructed online from on-board sensor data. Navigation-grade standard-definition (SD) maps are widely available, but their resolution is insufficient for direct deployment. Instead, they can be used as coarse prior to guide the online map construction process. We propose NavMapFusion, a diffusion-based framework that performs iterative denoising conditioned on high-fidelity sensor data and on low-fidelity navigation maps. This paper strives to answer: (1) How can coarse, potentially outdated navigation maps guide online map construction? (2) What advantages do diffusion models offer for map fusion? We demonstrate that diffusion-based map construction provides a robust framework for map fusion. Our key insight is that discrepancies between the prior map and online perception naturally correspond to noise within the diffusion process; consistent regions reinforce the map construction, whereas outdated segments are suppressed. On the nuScenes benchmark, NavMapFusion conditioned on coarse road lines from OpenStreetMap data reaches a 21.4% relative improvement on 100 m, and even stronger improvements on larger perception ranges, while maintaining real-time capabilities. By fusing low-fidelity priors with high-fidelity sensor data, the proposed method generates accurate and up-to-date environment representations, guiding towards safer and more reliable autonomous driving.

Addressing the systematic misalignment between existing theoretical models and real-world economic complexities, we identify three critical gaps: (1) data modality mismatch where unstructured textual sources (e.g. negotiation records, approval documents) impede accurate customer profiling; (2) dynamic feature entanglement challenges in modeling nonlinear price elasticity and time-varying attributes; (3) operational infeasibility caused by multi-tier business constraints.\n  Our framework introduces a tri-level architecture for above challenges. We design a hybrid knowledge fusion engine employing large language models (LLMs) for deep semantic parsing of unstructured text, transforming distributor agreements and sales assessments into structured features while integrating managerial expertise. Then a game-theoretic constrained optimization mechanism is employed to dynamically reconcile supply chain interests through bilateral utility functions, encoding manufacturer-distributor profit redistribution as endogenous objectives under hierarchical constraints.

Recent reinforcement learning (RL) based large-thinking models demonstrate impressive expert-level abilities, i.e., software and math, but still rely heavily on verifiable rewards in specific domains, placing a significant bottleneck to extend the performance boundary of general reasoning capabilities. In this work, we propose PretrainZero, a reinforcement active learning framework built on the pretraining corpus to extend RL from domain-specific post-training to general pretraining. PretrainZero features the following characteristics: 1) Active pretraining: inspired by the active learning ability of humans, PretrainZero learns a unified reasoning policy to actively identify reasonable and informative contents from pretraining corpus, and reason to predict these contents by RL. 2) Self-supervised learning: without any verifiable labels, pretrained reward models, or supervised fine-tuning, we directly pretrain reasoners from 3 to 30B base models on the general Wikipedia corpus using RL, significantly breaking the verification data-wall for general reasoning. 3) Verification scaling: by tackling increasingly challenging masked spans, PretrainZero substantially enhances the general reasoning abilities of pretrained base models. In reinforcement pretraining, PretrainZero improves Qwen3-4B-Base for 8.43, 5.96 and 10.60 on MMLU-Pro, SuperGPQA and math average benchmarks.

Traditional policy learning paradigms, including both Imitation Learning (IL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), struggle to cultivate generalizability across diverse scenarios. While IL policies often overfit to specific expert trajectories, RL suffers from the inherent lack of a unified and general reward signal necessary for effective multi-scene generalization. We posit that the world model is uniquely capable of serving as a universal environment proxy to address this limitation. However, current world models primarily focus on their ability to predict observations and still rely on task-specific, handcrafted reward functions, thereby failing to provide a truly general training environment. Toward this problem, we propose RoboScape-R, a framework leveraging the world model to serve as a versatile, general-purpose proxy for the embodied environment within the RL paradigm. We introduce a novel world model-based general reward mechanism that generates ''endogenous'' rewards derived from the model's intrinsic understanding of real-world state transition dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoboScape-R effectively addresses the limitations of traditional RL methods by providing an efficient and general training environment that substantially enhances the generalization capability of embodied policies. Our approach offers critical insights into utilizing the world model as an online training strategy and achieves an average 37.5% performance improvement over baselines under out-of-domain scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faRoboScape-R\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u73af\u5883\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5185\u751f\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5177\u8eab\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u8de8\u57df\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5177\u8eab\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\uff1aIL\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0cRL\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u901a\u7528\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u771f\u6b63\u901a\u7528\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u73af\u5883\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRoboScape-R\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4f5c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u901a\u7528\u73af\u5883\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u4ece\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u5185\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u2018\u5185\u751f\u2019\u5956\u52b1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eRoboScape-R\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edfRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5177\u8eab\u7b56\u7565\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u8de8\u57df\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534737.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5728\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5176\u5185\u751f\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u901a\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Within this landscape, mixed-data clustering has become a critical challenge, requiring innovative methods that can effectively exploit heterogeneous data types, including numerical and categorical variables. Traditional clustering techniques, typically designed for homogeneous datasets, often struggle to capture the additional complexity introduced by mixed data, underscoring the need for approaches specifically tailored to this setting.

MemVerse maintains short-term memory for recent context while transforming raw multimodal experiences into structured long-term memories organized as hierarchical knowledge graphs. This design supports continual consolidation, adaptive forgetting, and bounded memory growth. To handle real-time demands, MemVerse introduces a periodic distillation mechanism that compresses essential knowledge from long-term memory into the parametric model, allowing fast, differentiable recall while preserving interpretability.

Experiments demonstrate that retaining only the pivotal Keys with the highest similarity to the Query as the context window during the decoding stage achieves performance comparable to, or even surpassing, full attention on downstream tasks such as HELMET and LongBench v2. Second, we further explore the native Top-$k$ Attention training strategy. Experiments confirm that ensuring the consistency between training and inference regarding Top-$k$ Attention operations facilitates the further unlocking of Top-$k$ Decoding's potential, thereby significantly enhancing model performance. Furthermore, considering the high computational complexity of exact Top-$k$ Attention, we investigate the impact of approximate Top-$k$ algorithm precision on downstream tasks. Our research confirms a positive correlation between downstream task performance and approximation fidelity, and we provide statistical evaluations of the Lightning Indexer's precision within the DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp model.

A motion planning scheme generally comprises of a trajectory planning method and an inverse kinematic solver to determine trajectories and joints solutions respectively. In this paper, 3 motion planning schemes developed based on Jacobian methods are implemented to traverse a redundant manipulator with a coupled finger gripper through given trajectories. RRT* algorithm is used for planning trajectories and screw theory based forward kinematic equations are solved for determining joint solutions of the manipulator and gripper. Inverse solutions are computed separately using 3 Jacobian based methods such as Jacobian Transpose (JT), Pseudo Inverse (PI), and Damped Least Square (DLS) methods.

Traditionally, EF estimation requires manual tracing and domain expertise, making the process time-consuming and subject to interobserver variability. Most current deep learning methods for EF prediction are black-box models with limited transparency, which reduces clinical trust. Some post-hoc explainability methods have been proposed to interpret the decision-making process after the prediction is made. However, these explanations do not guide the model's internal reasoning and therefore offer limited reliability in clinical applications. To address this, we introduce ProtoEFNet, a novel video-based prototype learning model for continuous EF regression. The model learns dynamic spatiotemporal prototypes that capture clinically meaningful cardiac motion patterns. Additionally, the proposed Prototype Angular Separation (PAS) loss enforces discriminative representations across the continuous EF spectrum. Our experiments on the EchonetDynamic dataset show that ProtoEFNet can achieve accuracy on par with its non-interpretable counterpart while providing clinically relevant insight. The ablation study shows that the proposed loss boosts performance with a 2% increase in F1 score from 77.67$\\pm$2.68 to 79.64$\\pm$2.10.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged and become a promising approach to achieving AHD, but current LLM-based AHD research often only considers a single role. This paper proposes RoCo, a novel Multi-Agent Role-Based System, to enhance the diversity and quality of AHD through multi-role collaboration. RoCo coordinates four specialized LLM-guided agents-explorer, exploiter, critic, and integrator-to collaboratively generate high-quality heuristics. The explorer promotes long-term potential through creative, diversity-driven thinking, while the exploiter focuses on short-term improvements via conservative, efficiency-oriented refinements. The critic evaluates the effectiveness of each evolution step and provides targeted feedback and reflection. The integrator synthesizes proposals from the explorer and exploiter, balancing innovation and exploitation to drive overall progress. These agents interact in a structured multi-round process involving feedback, refinement, and elite mutations guided by both short-term and accumulated long-term reflections.

Our findings show that reasoning is not a universal solution and its effectiveness is highly dependent on the specific strategy and context. Specifically, we observe a trade-off between summary quality and factual faithfulness: explicit reasoning strategies tend to improve fluency at the expense of factual grounding, while implicit reasoning in LRMs exhibits the inverse pattern.

However, their application raises significant fairness concerns, as GNNs can perpetuate and even amplify societal biases against protected groups defined by sensitive attributes such as race or gender. These biases are often inherent in the node features, structural topology, and message-passing mechanisms of the graph itself. A critical limitation of existing fairness-aware GNN methods is their reliance on the strong assumption that sensitive attributes are fully available for all nodes during training--a condition that poses a practical impediment due to privacy concerns and data collection constraints. To address this gap, we propose a novel, model-agnostic fairness regularization framework designed for the realistic scenario where sensitive attributes are only partially available. Our approach formalizes a fairness-aware objective function that integrates both equal opportunity and statistical parity as differentiable regularization terms. Through a comprehensive empirical evaluation across five real-world benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method significantly mitigates bias across key fairness metrics while maintaining competitive node classification performance. Results show that our framework consistently outperforms baseline models in achieving a favorable fairness-accuracy trade-off, with minimal degradation in predictive accuracy.

This issue is problematic in image restoration for safety-critical domains such as medical imaging, industrial inspection, and remote sensing, where such errors undermine reliability and trust. For example, in low-field MRI, widely used in resource-limited settings, restoration models are essential for enhancing low-quality scans, yet hallucinations can lead to serious diagnostic errors. Progress has been hindered by a circular dependency: evaluating hallucinations requires labeled data, yet such labels are costly and subjective. We introduce HalluGen, a diffusion-based framework that synthesizes realistic hallucinations with controllable type, location, and severity, producing perceptually realistic but semantically incorrect outputs (segmentation IoU drops from 0.86 to 0.36). Using HalluGen, we construct the first large-scale hallucination dataset comprising 4,350 annotated images derived from 1,450 brain MR images for low-field enhancement, enabling systematic evaluation of hallucination detection and mitigation. We demonstrate its utility in two applications: (1) benchmarking image quality metrics and developing Semantic Hallucination Assessment via Feature Evaluation (SHAFE), a feature-based metric with soft-attention pooling that improves hallucination sensitivity over traditional metrics; and (2) training reference-free hallucination detectors that generalize to real restoration failures. Together, HalluGen and its open dataset establish the first scalable foundation for evaluating hallucinations in safety-critical image restoration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faHalluGen\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5408\u6210\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u3001\u903c\u771f\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u9996\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e7b\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807SHAFE\u548c\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u4e2d\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u53ef\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u4e2d\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\uff08\u5373\u770b\u4f3c\u5408\u7406\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff09\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u533b\u7597\u5f71\u50cf\u7b49\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u4f1a\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u8bca\u65ad\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff1b\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u5e7b\u89c9\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u3001\u6602\u8d35\u4e14\u4e3b\u89c2\u7684\u56f0\u5883\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHalluGen\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u5408\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u63a7\u5236\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5176\u6784\u5efa\u9996\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\uff084350\u5f20\uff09\u5e26\u6807\u6ce8\u5e7b\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bbe\u8ba1SHAFE\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u53ca\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u3002", "result": "HalluGen\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u56fe\u50cf\u4f7f\u5206\u5272IoU\u4ece0.86\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u81f30.36\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u4f4e\u573aMRI\u589e\u5f3a\u4e13\u7528\u5e7b\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1bSHAFE\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u81f3\u771f\u5b9e\u4fee\u590d\u5931\u8d25\u573a\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "HalluGen\u53ca\u5176\u5f00\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

They organize isolated persuasive techniques into coherent stories that justify actions, attribute blame, and evoke identification with ideological camps. In this paper, we propose a novel fine-grained narrative classification in biased news articles. We also explore article-bias classification as the precursor task to narrative classification and fine-grained persuasive technique identification. We develop INDI-PROP, the first ideologically grounded fine-grained narrative dataset with multi-level annotation for analyzing propaganda in Indian news media. Our dataset INDI-PROP comprises 1,266 articles focusing on two polarizing socio-political events in recent times: CAA and the Farmers' protest. Each article is annotated at three hierarchical levels: (i) ideological article-bias (pro-government, pro-opposition, neutral), (ii) event-specific fine-grained narrative frames anchored in ideological polarity and communicative intent, and (iii) persuasive techniques. We propose FANTA and TPTC, two GPT-4o-mini guided multi-hop prompt-based reasoning frameworks for the bias, narrative, and persuasive technique classification.

The gripper is driven by a servo-actuated Scotch--yoke mechanism, and includes separator leaves that form a conical frustum for fruit isolation, with an integrated micro-servo cutter for pedicel cutting. For perception, an RGB--D camera and a Detectron2-based pipeline perform semantic segmentation of ripe/unripe tomatoes and keypoint localization of the pedicel and fruit center under occlusion and variable illumination. An analytical model derived using the principle of virtual work relates servo torque to grasp force, enabling design-level reasoning about actuation requirements. During execution, closed-loop grasp-force regulation is achieved using a proportional--integral--derivative controller with feedback from force-sensitive resistors mounted on selected fingers to prevent slip and bruising. Motion execution is supported by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)--based trajectory planning for a 5-DOF manipulator. Experiments demonstrate complete picking cycles (approach, separation, cutting, grasping, transport, release) with an average cycle time of 24.34~s and an overall success rate of approximately 80\\%, while maintaining low grasp forces (0.20--0.50~N).

In this work, our aim is to interpret its structure for Flow Matching (FM). FM learns a velocity field that transports samples from a simple source distribution to data by integrating an ODE. In rectified FM, training pairs are obtained by linearly interpolating between a source sample and a data sample, and a neural velocity field is trained to predict the straight line displacement using a mean squared error loss. This squared loss collapses all velocity targets that reach the same space-time point into a single conditional mean, thereby ignoring higher order conditional information (variance, skewness, multi-modality) that encodes fine geometric structure about the data manifold and minority branches. We apply the standard risk-sensitive (log-exponential) transform to the conditional FM loss and show that the resulting tilted risk loss is a natural upper-bound on a meaningful conditional entropic FM objective defined at each space-time point. Furthermore, we show that a small order expansion of the gradient of this conditional entropic objective yields two interpretable first order corrections: covariance preconditioning of the FM residual, and a skew tail term that favors asymmetric or rare branches. On synthetic data designed to probe ambiguity and tails, the resulting risk-sensitive loss improves statistical metrics and recovers geometric structure more faithfully than standard rectified FM.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u503e\u659c\uff08\u71b5\uff09\u98ce\u9669\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6d41\u5339\u914d\uff08FM\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6761\u4ef6FM\u635f\u5931\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528\u5bf9\u6570-\u6307\u6570\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u71b5FM\u76ee\u6807\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u9884\u5904\u7406\u4e0e\u504f\u659c\u5c3e\u9879\u4e24\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u66f4\u597d\u6355\u6349\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5c11\u6570\u5206\u652f\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u77e9\u5f62FM\u4f7f\u7528\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4ec5\u5b66\u4e60\u6761\u4ef6\u5747\u503c\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u9ad8\u9636\u6761\u4ef6\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u65b9\u5dee\u3001\u504f\u5ea6\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e0\u6cd5\u523b\u753b\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5c11\u6570\u5206\u652f\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u6761\u4ef6FM\u635f\u5931\u5e94\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u98ce\u9669\u654f\u611f\uff08\u5bf9\u6570-\u6307\u6570\uff09\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u503e\u659c\u98ce\u9669\u635f\u5931\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u71b5FM\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u4e0a\u754c\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5c0f\u9636\u5c55\u5f00\u5176\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bfc\u51fa\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u9884\u5904\u7406\u548c\u504f\u659c\u5c3e\u9879\u4e24\u4e2a\u4fee\u6b63\u9879\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u63a2\u6d4b\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u548c\u5c3e\u90e8\u7279\u6027\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u98ce\u9669\u654f\u611f\u635f\u5931\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u77e9\u5f62FM\uff0c\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u6307\u6807\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u6062\u590d\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u503e\u659c\u98ce\u9669\u4e3a\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u5f0f\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u9636\u6761\u4ef6\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u7ed3\u6784\uff09\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002"}}

The subtle, non-adjacent nature of early disease signals is often lost due to suboptimal architectural inductive biases: 2D/3D CNNs impose strong locality, while ViTs diffuse unconstrained global attention. This conflict leaves the optimal inductive structure for robust, sparse volumetric pattern recognition unresolved. This study presents a controlled comparison of sixteen modern deep learning architectures spanning 2D/3D convolutional, hybrid, and volumetric transformer families for subclinical keratoconus (SKC) detection from 3D anterior segment OCT volumes. We demonstrate that hierarchical attention models offer a superior and more parameter-efficient inductive bias, surpassing the performance of both 2D and 3D CNNs and ViTs. Our results show 21-23% higher sensitivity and specificity in the sparse anomaly (subclinical) regime. Mechanistic analyses reveal that this advantage stems from precise spatial scale alignment: hierarchical windowing produces effective receptive fields matched to the intermediate, multi-slice extent of subclinical abnormalities. This avoids excessive CNN locality and diffuse global attention. Attention-distance measurements confirm a key insight into architectural adaptation: the required spatial integration length shifts significantly based on the signal strength, with subclinical cases necessitating longer integration compared to both healthy and manifest disease states. Representational similarity and auxiliary age/sex prediction tasks further support the generalizability of these inductive principles. The findings provide design guidance for future volumetric anomaly detection systems, establishing hierarchical attention as a principled and effective approach for early pathological change analysis in 3D medical imaging.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd416\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5206\u5c42\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e9a\u4e34\u5e8a\u89d2\u819c\u5706\u9525\u75c5\uff08SKC\uff09\u76843D OCT\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u80fd\u7cbe\u51c6\u5339\u914d\u4e9a\u4e34\u5e8a\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u9762\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u7279\u5f02\u602721-23%\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f3a\u5ea6\u51b3\u5b9a\u6240\u9700\u7a7a\u95f4\u6574\u5408\u957f\u5ea6\u8fd9\u4e00\u5173\u952e\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f31\u800c\u5f25\u6563\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u75be\u75c5\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728\u4f53\u7d20\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf2D/3D CNN\u548cViT\u56e0\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff08\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u6216\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5168\u5c40\u6269\u6563\uff09\u800c\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u9002\u914d\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4f53\u7d20\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u5bf916\u79cd\u73b0\u4ee3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u6db5\u76d62D/3D CNN\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u4f53\u7d20Transformer\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u53d7\u63a7\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece3D\u773c\u524d\u8282OCT\u4f53\u79ef\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e9a\u4e34\u5e8a\u89d2\u819c\u5706\u9525\u75c5\uff08SKC\uff09\uff1b\u8f85\u4ee5\u673a\u5236\u5206\u6790\uff08\u5206\u5c42\u7a97\u53e3\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u3001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8ddd\u79bb\u6d4b\u91cf\u3001\u8868\u5f81\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u53ca\u5e74\u9f84/\u6027\u522b\u9884\u6d4b\u8f85\u52a9\u4efb\u52a1\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u5c42\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eCNN\u4e0eViT\uff0c\u5728\u4e9a\u4e34\u5e8a\u7a00\u758f\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4e0e\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u63d0\u9ad821\u201323%\uff1b\u673a\u5236\u4e0a\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u5176\u5206\u5c42\u7a97\u53e3\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u7cbe\u51c6\u5339\u914d\u4e9a\u4e34\u5e8a\u75c5\u53d8\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff08\u8de8\u591a\u5207\u7247\uff09\uff1b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8ddd\u79bb\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e9a\u4e34\u5e8a\u72b6\u6001\u6240\u9700\u7a7a\u95f4\u6574\u5408\u957f\u5ea6\u4ecb\u4e8e\u5065\u5eb7\u4e0e\u663e\u6027\u75c5\u53d8\u4e4b\u95f4\u4e14\u66f4\u957f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u5c42\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u539f\u7406\u6e05\u6670\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u4e3a3D\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u65e9\u671f\u75c5\u7406\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

This paper introduces the Static Deep Research Agent (Static-DRA), a novel solution built upon a configurable and hierarchical Tree-based static workflow.\n  The core contribution is the integration of two user-tunable parameters, Depth and Breadth, which provide granular control over the research intensity. This design allows end-users to consciously balance the desired quality and comprehensiveness of the research report against the associated computational cost of Large Language Model (LLM) interactions. The agent's architecture, comprising Supervisor, Independent, and Worker agents, facilitates effective multi-hop information retrieval and parallel sub-topic investigation.\n  We evaluate the Static-DRA against the established DeepResearch Bench using the RACE (Reference-based Adaptive Criteria-driven Evaluation) framework. Configured with a depth of 2 and a breadth of 5, and powered by the gemini-2.5-pro model, the agent achieved an overall score of 34.72. Our experiments validate that increasing the configured Depth and Breadth parameters results in a more in-depth research process and a correspondingly higher evaluation score.

We propose an interpretable framework for factual consistency assessment for in-domain and open-domain texts to address these limitations. Our approach decomposes text into atomic facts and introduces a flexible, schema-free methodology. Unlike previous methods with an absolute metric, we incorporate a weighted metric to enhance factual evaluation.

We present ContactRL, a reinforcement learning (RL) based framework that directly incorporates contact safety into the reward function through force feedback. This enables a robot to learn adaptive motion profiles that minimize human-robot contact forces while maintaining task efficiency. In simulation, ContactRL achieves a low safety violation rate of 0.2\\% with a high task success rate of 87.7\\%, outperforming state-of-the-art constrained RL baselines.

While prior work has primarily focused on ensuring compliance, our approach considers scenarios where deviating from policies may be necessary to achieve high-stakes goals. Additionally, modeling non-compliant behavior can assist policymakers by simulating realistic human decision-making. Our framework extends Gelfond and Lobo's Authorization and Obligation Policy Language (AOPL) to incorporate penalties and integrates Answer Set Programming (ASP) for reasoning. Compared to previous approaches, our method ensures well-formed policies, accounts for policy priorities, and enhances explainability by explicitly identifying rule violations and their consequences. Building on the work of Harders and Inclezan, we introduce penalty-based reasoning to distinguish between non-compliant plans, prioritizing those with minimal repercussions. To support this, we develop an automated translation from the extended AOPL into ASP and refine ASP-based planning algorithms to account for incurred penalties. Experiments in two domains demonstrate that our framework generates higher-quality plans that avoid harmful actions while, in some cases, also improving computational efficiency. These findings underscore its potential for enhancing autonomous decision-making and informing policy refinement.

Crucially, GenAI is supplanting other technologies to become a primary information source: this trend persists despite low user digital literacy, posing a risk as users struggle to recognize errors or misinformation. Moreover, we identify a significant gender divide -- particularly pronounced in older generations -- where women are half as likely to adopt GenAI and use it less frequently than men. While we find literacy to be a key predictor of adoption, it only partially explains this disparity, suggesting that other barriers are at play. Overall, our data provide granular insights into the multipurpose usage of GenAI, highlighting the dual need for targeted educational initiatives and further investigation into the underlying barriers to equitable participation that competence alone cannot explain.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper presents the first comprehensive empirical study on GenAI adoption, usage patterns, and literacy in Italy, revealing widespread use for sensitive tasks despite low digital literacy and a significant gender divide in adoption, especially among older generations.", "motivation": "The rise of generative AI chatbots risks widening digital divides due to uneven adoption and low awareness of their limitations; thus, there is a need to empirically map adoption, usage, and literacy to inform equitable policy and education.", "method": "The study uses newly collected survey data from 1,906 Italian-speaking adults to analyze GenAI adoption, usage patterns, and digital literacy, with statistical analysis to identify demographic disparities and predictors of adoption.", "result": "Widespread GenAI adoption for work and personal use\u2014including sensitive domains\u2014is observed; GenAI is replacing other information sources despite low user literacy; a pronounced gender gap exists, with women half as likely to adopt and use GenAI, especially among older generations; literacy predicts adoption only partially.", "conclusion": "GenAI is rapidly becoming a primary information source in Italy, but its adoption is inequitable and poorly understood\u2014highlighting an urgent need for targeted digital literacy initiatives and deeper investigation into non-literacy barriers (e.g., social, cultural, or design-related) to ensure inclusive participation."}}

Yet, these initial state estimates-often based on limited or biased information-can be severely misaligned with reality, constraining subsequent actions and potentially causing catastrophic delays, resource misallocation, and human harm. Under the stationary bootstrap baseline (zero transition and no rejuvenation), bootstrap particle filters exhibit Stationarity-Induced Posterior Support Invariance (S-PSI), wherein regions excluded by the initial prior remain permanently unexplorable, making corrections impossible even when new evidence contradicts current beliefs. While classical perturbations can in principle break this lock-in, they operate in an always-on fashion and may be inefficient. To overcome this, we propose a diffusion-driven Bayesian exploration framework that enables principled, real-time correction of early state estimation errors. Our method expands posterior support via entropy-regularized sampling and covariance-scaled diffusion. A Metropolis-Hastings check validates proposals and keeps inference adaptive to unexpected evidence. Empirical evaluations on realistic hazardous-gas localization tasks show that our approach matches reinforcement learning and planning baselines when priors are correct. It substantially outperforms classical SMC perturbations and RL-based methods under misalignment, and we provide theoretical guarantees that DEPF resolves S-PSI while maintaining statistical rigor.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a2\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\uff08DEPF\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u4fee\u6b63\u7d27\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\u7b49\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u56e0\u521d\u59cb\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u504f\u5dee\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u652f\u6301\u9501\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff08S-PSI\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u71b5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u91c7\u6837\u4e0e\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7f29\u653e\u6269\u6563\u6269\u5c55\u540e\u9a8c\u652f\u6491\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5Metropolis-Hastings\u68c0\u9a8c\u4fdd\u969c\u63a8\u7406\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u6c14\u4f53\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfSMC\u6270\u52a8\u4e0eRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e9\u671f\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u5e38\u56e0\u4fe1\u606f\u6709\u9650\u6216\u6709\u504f\u800c\u4e25\u91cd\u5931\u771f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u540e\u7eed\u51b3\u7b56\u5931\u6548\u751a\u81f3\u707e\u96be\u6027\u540e\u679c\uff1b\u7ecf\u5178bootstrap\u7c92\u5b50\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5728\u9759\u6001\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u540e\u9a8c\u652f\u6491\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff08S-PSI\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u521d\u59cb\u5148\u9a8c\u6392\u9664\u7684\u533a\u57df\u6c38\u4e45\u4e0d\u53ef\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u81ea\u6211\u7ea0\u6b63\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6269\u6563\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a2\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\uff08DEPF\uff09\uff1a\u7ed3\u5408\u71b5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u91c7\u6837\u4e0e\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7f29\u653e\u6269\u6563\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u540e\u9a8c\u652f\u6491\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165Metropolis-Hastings\u6821\u9a8c\u673a\u5236\u786e\u4fdd\u5bf9\u5f02\u5e38\u65b0\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u5f3a\u7684\u5371\u9669\u6c14\u4f53\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f53\u5148\u9a8c\u6b63\u786e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u89c4\u5212\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u5f53\u5148\u9a8c\u5931\u51c6\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178SMC\u6270\u52a8\u548cRL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660eDEPF\u53ef\u6d88\u9664S-PSI\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DEPF\u4e3a\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u53ef\u4fee\u6b63\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

The IQOTHNCCD lung cancer dataset is utilized, which is a public CT scan dataset consisting of cases categorized into Normal, Benign, and Malignant and used DenseNet169, which includes Squeezeand-Excitation blocks for attention-based feature extraction, Focal Loss for handling class imbalance, and a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) for multi-scale feature fusion.

For model interpretability enhancement, the study integrated Grad-CAM for the visualization of decision-making regions in CT scans and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) for explanation of feature contributions within the SVM model. Intensive evaluation was performed, and it was found that both DenseNet169 and SVM models achieved 98% accuracy, suggesting their robustness for real-world medical practice.

A single-agent implementation demonstrates the benchmark's applicability, establishing quantitative metrics for comparison of LLM-based planning and execution approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eBlocksworld\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5de5\u4e1a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u6267\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7Model Context Protocol\uff08MCP\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u4ee3\u7406\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u63a5\u5165\u4e0e\u516c\u5e73\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de5\u4e1a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u9700\u8981\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u6267\u884c\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u4e94\u4e2a\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7b49\u7ea7\u7684Blocksworld\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u57fa\u51c6\uff1b\u5f15\u5165Model Context Protocol\uff08MCP\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cdLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u67b6\u6784\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u5730\u63a5\u5165\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u9762\u5411LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u53ef\u6267\u884cBlocksworld\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08\u5982\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3001\u6b65\u6570\u3001\u8017\u65f6\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7MCP\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u591a\u67b6\u6784\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\uff1b\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u586b\u8865\u4e86LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u3002"}}

Featuring multiple engineering objectives, Hydro-SE is an inherently interdisciplinary domain that integrates scientific knowledge with engineering expertise. This integration necessitates extensive expert collaboration in decision-making, which poses difficulties for intelligence. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), their potential application in the Hydro-SE domain is being increasingly explored. However, the knowledge and application abilities of LLMs in Hydro-SE have not been sufficiently evaluated. To address this issue, we propose the Hydro-SE LLM evaluation benchmark (Hydro-SE Bench), which contains 4,000 multiple-choice questions. Hydro-SE Bench covers nine subfields and enables evaluation of LLMs in aspects of basic conceptual knowledge, engineering application ability, and reasoning and calculation ability. The evaluation results on Hydro-SE Bench show that the accuracy values vary among 0.74 to 0.80 for commercial LLMs, and among 0.41 to 0.68 for small-parameter LLMs. While LLMs perform well in subfields closely related to natural and physical sciences, they struggle with domain-specific knowledge such as industry standards and hydraulic structures. Model scaling mainly improves reasoning and calculation abilities, but there is still great potential for LLMs to better handle problems in practical engineering application. This study highlights the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs for Hydro-SE tasks, providing model developers with clear training targets and Hydro-SE researchers with practical guidance for applying LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aHydro-SE Bench\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b4000\u9053\u591a\u9009\u9898\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u6c34\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0e\u5de5\u7a0b\uff08Hydro-SE\uff09\u9886\u57df\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u638c\u63e1\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u73b0\u6709LLMs\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u79d1\u5b66\u76f8\u5173\u5b50\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u884c\u4e1a\u6807\u51c6\u3001\u6c34\u5de5\u7ed3\u6784\u7b49\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u4ecd\u663e\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u63d0\u5347\u4e3b\u8981\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e94\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u4ecd\u6709\u8f83\u5927\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u6c34\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0e\u5de5\u7a0b\uff08Hydro-SE\uff09\u9886\u57df\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8986\u76d6\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5236\u7ea6\u5176\u5728\u8be5\u5173\u952e\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u5de5\u7a0b\u9886\u57df\u7684\u843d\u5730\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u6db5\u76d69\u4e2a\u5b50\u9886\u57df\u7684Hydro-SE Bench\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff08\u542b4000\u9053\u591a\u9009\u9898\uff09\uff0c\u4ece\u57fa\u672c\u6982\u5ff5\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e94\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u4e09\u65b9\u9762\u5bf9LLMs\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5546\u7528\u5927\u6a21\u578b vs \u5c0f\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u5546\u7528LLMs\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ecb\u4e8e0.74\u20130.80\uff0c\u5c0f\u53c2\u6570LLMs\u4e3a0.41\u20130.68\uff1bLLMs\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u79d1\u5b66\u76f8\u5173\u5b50\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u884c\u4e1a\u6807\u51c6\u3001\u6c34\u5229\u7ed3\u6784\u7b49\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u660e\u663e\u8584\u5f31\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u7f29\u653e\u4e3b\u8981\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e94\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "Hydro-SE Bench\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u6c34\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0e\u5de5\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0e\u77ed\u677f\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u6307\u660e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3aHydro-SE\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86LLM\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

Information-theoretic, hallucination detector for financial application. Feedback from researchers and practitioners is welcome", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) produce fluent but unsupported answers - hallucinations - limiting safe deployment in high-stakes domains. We propose ECLIPSE, a framework that treats hallucination as a mismatch between a model's semantic entropy and the capacity of available evidence. We combine entropy estimation via multi-sample clustering with a novel perplexity decomposition that measures how models use retrieved evidence. We prove that under mild conditions, the resulting entropy-capacity objective is strictly convex with a unique stable optimum. We evaluate on a controlled financial question answering dataset with GPT-3.5-turbo (n=200 balanced samples with synthetic hallucinations), where ECLIPSE achieves ROC AUC of 0.89 and average precision of 0.90, substantially outperforming a semantic entropy-only baseline (AUC 0.50). A controlled ablation with Claude-3-Haiku, which lacks token-level log probabilities, shows AUC dropping to 0.59 with coefficient magnitudes decreasing by 95% - demonstrating that ECLIPSE is a logprob-native mechanism whose effectiveness depends on calibrated token-level uncertainties. The perplexity decomposition features exhibit the largest learned coefficients, confirming that evidence utilization is central to hallucination detection.

However, existing research predominantly focuses on coarse spatiotemporal scales and relies on low-resolution satellite data, capturing only macroscopic fire states while fundamentally constraining high-precision localized fire dynamics modeling capabilities. To bridge this gap, we present FireSentry, a provincial-scale multi-modal wildfire dataset characterized by sub-meter spatial and sub-second temporal resolution. Collected using synchronized UAV platforms, FireSentry provides visible and infrared video streams, in-situ environmental measurements, and manually validated fire masks. Building on FireSentry, we establish a comprehensive benchmark encompassing physics-based, data-driven, and generative models, revealing the limitations of existing mask-only approaches. Our analysis proposes FiReDiff, a novel dual-modality paradigm that first predicts future video sequences in the infrared modality, and then precisely segments fire masks in the mask modality based on the generated dynamics. FiReDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance, with video quality gains of 39.2% in PSNR, 36.1% in SSIM, 50.0% in LPIPS, 29.4% in FVD, and mask accuracy gains of 3.3% in AUPRC, 59.1% in F1 score, 42.9% in IoU, and 62.5% in MSE when applied to generative models.

We investigate whether different syntactic phenomena recruit shared or distinct components in LLMs. Using a functional localization approach inspired by cognitive neuroscience, we identify the LLM units most responsive to 67 English syntactic phenomena in seven open-weight models. These units are consistently recruited across sentences containing the phenomena and causally support the models' syntactic performance. Critically, different types of syntactic agreement (e.g., subject-verb, anaphor, determiner-noun) recruit overlapping sets of units, suggesting that agreement constitutes a meaningful functional category for LLMs. This pattern holds in English, Russian, and Chinese; and further, in a cross-lingual analysis of 57 diverse languages, structurally more similar languages share more units for subject-verb agreement.

This raises a fundamental challenge: how should we design and control robot manipulators that are optimized for dexterity? We present a co-design framework that learns task-specific hand morphology and complementary dexterous control policies. The framework supports 1) an expansive morphology search space including joint, finger, and palm generation, 2) scalable evaluation across the wide design space via morphology-conditioned cross-embodied control, and 3) real-world fabrication with accessible components.

To evaluate the success of their trajectories, researchers have developed verifiers, such as LLM judges and process-reward models, to score the quality of each action in an agent's trajectory. Although these heuristic scores can be informative, there are no guarantees of correctness when used to decide whether an agent will yield a successful output. Here, we introduce e-valuator, a method to convert any black-box verifier score into a decision rule with provable control of false alarm rates. We frame the problem of distinguishing successful trajectories (that is, a sequence of actions that will lead to a correct response to the user's prompt) and unsuccessful trajectories as a sequential hypothesis testing problem. E-valuator builds on tools from e-processes to develop a sequential hypothesis test that remains statistically valid at every step of an agent's trajectory, enabling online monitoring of agents over arbitrarily long sequences of actions. Empirically, we demonstrate that e-valuator provides greater statistical power and better false alarm rate control than other strategies across six datasets and three agents. We additionally show that e-valuator can be used for to quickly terminate problematic trajectories and save tokens. Together, e-valuator provides a lightweight, model-agnostic framework that converts verifier heuristics into decisions rules with statistical guarantees, enabling the deployment of more reliable agentic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fae-valuator\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u9ed1\u76d2\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u5206\u6570\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7e-processes\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u3001\u9010\u6b65\u7edf\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u76d1\u63a7\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8bc4\u5206\uff08\u5982LLM\u88c1\u5224\uff09\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8f68\u8ff9\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u53ef\u9760\u5224\u65ad\u8f68\u8ff9\u662f\u5426\u6700\u7ec8\u6210\u529f\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6210\u529f\u4e0e\u5931\u8d25\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u533a\u5206\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5e8f\u8d2f\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528e-processes\u7406\u8bba\u6784\u5efa\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u90fd\u4fdd\u6301\u7edf\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff08\u5373\u4e25\u683c\u63a7\u5236\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\uff09\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u68c0\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e0a\uff0ce-valuator\u76f8\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u7b56\u7565\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u529f\u6548\u548c\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u63a7\u5236\uff1b\u5e76\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u4e2d\u6b62\u95ee\u9898\u8f68\u8ff9\u4ee5\u8282\u7701\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\uff08token\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "e-valuator\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u5c06\u4efb\u610f\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5177\u5907\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u6027\u3002"}}

Gaussian-based methods have demonstrated superior performance and computational efficiency across a wide range of scene understanding tasks. However, existing methods either model objects as closed-set semantic Gaussians supervised by annotated 3D labels, neglecting their rendering ability, or learn open-set Gaussian representations via purely 2D self-supervision, leading to degraded geometry and limited to camera-only settings. To fully exploit the potential of Gaussians, we propose a Multi-Modal Gaussian Transformer that enables Gaussians to query features from diverse sensor modalities, and a Shelf-Supervised Learning Paradigm that efficiently optimizes Gaussians with VFM features jointly at 2D image and 3D scene levels. We evaluate ShelfGaussian on various perception and planning tasks. Experiments on Occ3D-nuScenes demonstrate its state-of-the-art zero-shot semantic occupancy prediction performance. ShelfGaussian is further evaluated on an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) to assess its in the-wild performance across diverse urban scenarios.

However, this introduces challenges in conditioning predictions on navigation goals and ensuring stable, kinematically feasible trajectories. Addressing the former challenge, this paper investigates the extension of attention-based motion prediction models with navigation information. By integrating the ego vehicle's intended route and goal pose into the model architecture, we bridge the gap between multi-agent motion prediction and goal-based motion planning.

First, the canonical Shapley framework assumes that the worth function is additive, yet real-world payoff constructions--driven by non-Gaussian distributions, heavy tails, feature dependence, or domain-specific loss scales--often violate this assumption, leading to distorted attributions. Secondly, achieving sparse explanations in high dimensions by computing dense Shapley values and then applying ad hoc thresholding is prohibitively costly and risks inconsistency. We introduce Sparse Isotonic Shapley Regression (SISR), a unified nonlinear explanation framework. SISR simultaneously learns a monotonic transformation to restore additivity--obviating the need for a closed-form specification--and enforces an L0 sparsity constraint on the Shapley vector, enhancing computational efficiency in large feature spaces. Its optimization algorithm leverages Pool-Adjacent-Violators for efficient isotonic regression and normalized hard-thresholding for support selection, yielding implementation ease and global convergence guarantees. Analysis shows that SISR recovers the true transformation in a wide range of scenarios and achieves strong support recovery even in high noise. Moreover, we are the first to demonstrate that irrelevant features and inter-feature dependencies can induce a true payoff transformation that deviates substantially from linearity. Experiments in regression, logistic regression, and tree ensembles demonstrate that SISR stabilizes attributions across payoff schemes, correctly filters irrelevant features while standard Shapley values suffer severe rank and sign distortions. By unifying nonlinear transformation estimation with sparsity pursuit, SISR advances the frontier of nonlinear explainability, providing a theoretically grounded and practical attribution framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSparse Isotonic Shapley Regression (SISR)\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u5355\u8c03\u53d8\u6362\u6062\u590d\u53ef\u52a0\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u65bd\u52a0L0\u7a00\u758f\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3Shapley\u503c\u5728\u975e\u52a0\u6027\u8bbe\u5b9a\u548c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7a00\u758f\u89e3\u91ca\u4e2d\u7684\u4e24\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "Shapley\u503c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u7684\u91d1\u6807\u51c6\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u5176\u7ecf\u5178\u6846\u67b6\u5047\u8bbe\u6536\u76ca\u51fd\u6570\u53ef\u52a0\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u5e38\u56e0\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u91cd\u5c3e\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u4f9d\u8d56\u6216\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u635f\u5931\u5c3a\u5ea6\u800c\u8fdd\u53cd\u8be5\u5047\u8bbe\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u9ad8\u7ef4\u4e0b\u5148\u8ba1\u7b97\u7a20\u5bc6Shapley\u503c\u518d\u9608\u503c\u622a\u65ad\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a00\u758f\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\u4e14\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSparse Isotonic Shapley Regression (SISR)\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u4e00\u4e2a\u5355\u8c03\u53d8\u6362\uff08\u6062\u590d\u53ef\u52a0\u6027\uff09\u548c\u5e26L0\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u7a00\u758fShapley\u5411\u91cf\uff1b\u4f18\u5316\u91c7\u7528Pool-Adjacent-Violators\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u7b49\u5f20\u56de\u5f52\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u786c\u9608\u503c\u9009\u62e9\u652f\u6491\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660eSISR\u80fd\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6062\u590d\u771f\u5b9e\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u4ecd\u5177\u5f3a\u652f\u6491\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u6811\u96c6\u6210\u4e2d\u7a33\u5b9a\u5f52\u56e0\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u8fc7\u6ee4\u65e0\u5173\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u800c\u6807\u51c6Shapley\u503c\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u6392\u5e8f\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u4e25\u91cd\u5931\u771f\u3002", "conclusion": "SISR\u9996\u6b21\u5c06\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u6362\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u8ffd\u6c42\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u4e3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u517c\u5177\u7406\u8bba\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

To address this issue, we propose MOS, a novel framework designed to mitigate the optical-SAR modality gap and achieve modality-consistent feature learning for optical-SAR cross-modal ship ReID. MOS consists of two core components: (1) Modality-Consistent Representation Learning (MCRL) applies denoise SAR image procession and a class-wise modality alignment loss to align intra-identity feature distributions across modalities. (2) Cross-modal Data Generation and Feature fusion (CDGF) leverages a brownian bridge diffusion model to synthesize cross-modal samples, which are subsequently fused with original features during inference to enhance alignment and discriminability. Extensive experiments on the HOSS ReID dataset demonstrate that MOS significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods across all evaluation protocols, achieving notable improvements of +3.0%, +6.2%, and +16.4% in R1 accuracy under the ALL to ALL, Optical to SAR, and SAR to Optical settings, respectively.

Code available at https://github.com/lyj20071013/DZ-TDPO", "summary": "Long-context dialogue systems suffer from State Inertia, where static constraints prevent models from resolving conflicts between evolving user intents and established historical context. To address this, we propose DZ-TDPO, a non-destructive alignment framework that synergizes conflict-aware dynamic KL constraints with a learnable temporal attention bias. Experiments on the Multi-Session Chat (MSC) dataset demonstrate that DZ-TDPO achieves state-of-the-art win rates (86.2% on Phi-3.5) while maintaining robust zero-shot generalization. Crucially, our scaling analysis reveals a \"Capacity-Stability Trade-off\": while smaller models incur an \"alignment tax\" (perplexity surge) to overcome historical inertia, the larger Qwen2.5-7B model achieves near-perfect alignment (99.4% win rate) with negligible perplexity overhead. This confirms that TAI can be alleviated via precise attention regulation rather than destructive weight updates, preserving general capabilities (MMLU) across model scales.

Real-time capability of the planner requires utilizing convex approximation of optimal control problems (OCPs) for the planner. However, such approximations confine the solution to a subspace, which might not contain the global optimum. To address this, we propose using safe reinforcement learning (SRL) to obtain a new and safe reference trajectory within MPC. By employing a learning-based approach, the MPC can explore solutions beyond the close neighborhood of the previous one, potentially finding global optima.

Our approach utilizes a state-dependent Lagrangian multiplier, learned concurrently with the safe policy, to solve the CRL problem.

We present an integrated SHM framework that combines principal component analysis (PCA), a Bayesian neural network (BNN), and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) inference, mapping sparse strain gauge measurements onto leading PCA modes to reconstruct full-field strain distributions with uncertainty quantification. The framework was validated through cyclic four-point bending tests on carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) specimens with varying crack lengths, achieving accurate strain field reconstruction (R squared value > 0.9) while simultaneously producing real-time uncertainty fields. A key contribution is that the BNN yields robust full-field strain reconstructions from noisy experimental data with crack-induced strain singularities, while also providing explicit representations of two complementary uncertainty fields. Considered jointly in full-field form, the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty fields make it possible to diagnose at a local level, whether low-confidence regions are driven by data-inherent issues or by model-related limitations, thereby supporting reliable decision-making.

However, most affordance learning methods focus solely on \"how\" objects can be used while neglecting the \"what\" and \"where\" aspects. Other affordance detection methods treat object detection and affordance learning as two independent tasks, lacking effective interaction and real-time capability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce YOLO Affordance (YOLOA), a real-time affordance detection model that jointly handles these two tasks via a large language model (LLM) adapter. Specifically, YOLOA employs a lightweight detector consisting of object detection and affordance learning branches refined through the LLM Adapter. During training, the LLM Adapter interacts with object and affordance preliminary predictions to refine both branches by generating more accurate class priors, box offsets, and affordance gates. Experiments on our relabeled ADG-Det and IIT-Heat benchmarks demonstrate that YOLOA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (52.8 / 73.1 mAP on ADG-Det / IIT-Heat) while maintaining real-time performance (up to 89.77 FPS, and up to 846.24 FPS for the lightweight variant).

The core difficulty lies in likelihood approximation: while autoregressive models naturally provide token-level conditional probabilities essential for token-level RL objectives (e.g., GRPO), dLLMs generate sequences through iterative non-autoregressive denoising steps that lack this factorization. To address this fundamental mismatch, we propose ELBO-based Sequence-level Policy Optimization (ESPO), a principled RL framework that treats entire sequence generation as a single action and uses the ELBO as a tractable sequence-level likelihood proxy. Our method incorporates per-token normalization of importance ratios and robust KL-divergence estimation to ensure stable large-scale training. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning, coding, and planning tasks demonstrate that ESPO significantly outperforms token-level baselines, achieving dramatic improvements of 20-40 points on the Countdown task, while maintaining consistent gains on math and coding benchmarks.

The key challenge lies in AD's limited ability to interact with surrounding vehicles, largely due to a lack of understanding the underlying mechanisms of social interaction. To address this issue, we introduce MPCFormer, an explainable socially-aware autonomous driving approach with physics-informed and data-driven coupled social interaction dynamics. In this model, the dynamics are formulated into a discrete space-state representation, which embeds physics priors to enhance modeling explainability. The dynamics coefficients are learned from naturalistic driving data via a Transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture. To the best of our knowledge, MPCFormer is the first approach to explicitly model the dynamics of multi-vehicle social interactions. The learned social interaction dynamics enable the planner to generate manifold, human-like behaviors when interacting with surrounding traffic. By leveraging the MPC framework, the approach mitigates the potential safety risks typically associated with purely learning-based methods. Open-looped evaluation on NGSIM dataset demonstrates that MPCFormer achieves superior social interaction awareness, yielding the lowest trajectory prediction errors compared with other state-of-the-art approach. The prediction achieves an ADE as low as 0.86 m over a long prediction horizon of 5 seconds. Close-looped experiments in highly intense interaction scenarios, where consecutive lane changes are required to exit an off-ramp, further validate the effectiveness of MPCFormer. Results show that MPCFormer achieves the highest planning success rate of 94.67%, improves driving efficiency by 15.75%, and reduces the collision rate from 21.25% to 0.5%, outperforming a frontier Reinforcement Learning (RL) based planner.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMPCFormer\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u591a\u8f66\u793e\u4f1a\u4ea4\u4e92\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Transformer\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5728MPC\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7c7b\u4eba\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u4ea4\u901a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u8868\u73b0\u7c7b\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u5728\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u591a\u8f66\u793e\u4f1a\u4ea4\u4e92\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMPCFormer\uff1a\u5c06\u793e\u4f1a\u4ea4\u4e92\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5d4c\u5165\u7269\u7406\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528Transformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7ed3\u6784\u4ece\u771f\u5b9e\u9a7e\u9a76\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u6570\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\uff08MPC\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u95ed\u73af\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "result": "\u5728NGSIM\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5f00\u73af\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c5\u79d2\u9884\u6d4b\u8f68\u8ff9\u5e73\u5747\u4f4d\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee\uff08ADE\uff09\u4f4e\u81f30.86\u7c73\uff1b\u95ed\u73af\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u89c4\u5212\u6210\u529f\u738794.67%\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u534715.75%\uff0c\u78b0\u649e\u7387\u753121.25%\u964d\u81f30.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "MPCFormer\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u591a\u8f66\u793e\u4f1a\u4ea4\u4e92\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u7c7b\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u524d\u6cbf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u3002"}}

However, their ability to continually learn new tasks is severely hindered by catastrophic forgetting, both within a modality (intra-modal) and across modalities (inter-modal). While intra-modal forgetting has been studied in prior continual learning (CL) work, inter-modal forgetting remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we identify and empirically validate this phenomenon in UMGMs and provide a theoretical explanation rooted in gradient conflict between modalities. To address both intra- and inter-modal forgetting, we propose Modality-Decoupled Experts (MoDE), a lightweight and scalable architecture that isolates modality-specific updates to mitigate the gradient conflict and leverages knowledge distillation to prevent catastrophic forgetting and preserve pre-trained capabilities. Unlike previous CL methods that remain modality-coupled and suffer from modality gradient conflict, MoDE explicitly decouples modalities to prevent interference. Experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that MoDE significantly mitigates both inter- and intra-modal forgetting, outperforming prior CL baselines in unified multimodal generation settings.

The attack works by systematically replacing a harmful keyword (e.g., \\textit{bomb}) with a benign token (e.g., \\textit{carrot}) across multiple in-context examples, provided a prefix to a harmful request. We demonstrate that this substitution leads to the internal representation of the benign token converging toward that of the harmful one, effectively embedding the harmful semantics under a euphemism. As a result, superficially innocuous prompts (e.g., ``How to build a carrot?'') are internally interpreted as disallowed instructions (e.g., ``How to build a bomb?''), thereby bypassing the model's safety alignment. We use interpretability tools to show that this semantic overwrite emerges layer by layer, with benign meanings in early layers converging into harmful semantics in later ones. Doublespeak is optimization-free, broadly transferable across model families, and achieves strong success rates on closed-source and open-source systems, reaching 74\\% ASR on Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct with a single-sentence context override.

By integrating both subjective perceptions and objective states, the model precisely identifies and describes miscommunication.

We frame structure elucidation as conditional generation from an atomic diffusion model built on a non-equivariant transformer architecture. To model the complex chemical groups found in natural products, we generated a dataset of simulated 1D NMR spectra for over 111,000 natural products.

However, existing evaluations focus on urban and indoor scenarios, leaving a critical gap for specialized vegetation-dense environments. We present the first systematic zero-shot evaluation of eight state-of-the-art stereo methods--RAFT-Stereo, IGEV, IGEV++, BridgeDepth, StereoAnywhere, DEFOM (plus baseline methods ACVNet, PSMNet, TCstereo)--spanning iterative refinement, foundation model, and zero-shot adaptation paradigms. All methods are trained exclusively on Scene Flow and evaluated without fine-tuning on four standard benchmarks (ETH3D, KITTI 2012/2015, Middlebury) plus a novel 5,313-pair Canterbury forestry dataset captured with ZED Mini camera (1920x1080). Performance reveals scene-dependent patterns: foundation models excel on structured scenes (BridgeDepth: 0.23 px on ETH3D, 0.83-1.07 px on KITTI; DEFOM: 0.35-4.65 px across benchmarks), while iterative methods maintain cross-domain robustness (IGEV++: 0.36-6.77 px; IGEV: 0.33-21.91 px). Critical finding: RAFT-Stereo exhibits catastrophic ETH3D failure (26.23 px EPE, 98 percent error rate) due to negative disparity predictions, while performing normally on KITTI (0.90-1.11 px).

However, achieving semantically controllable dexterous grasp synthesis remains highly challenging due to the lack of unified modeling of multiple semantic dimensions, including grasp taxonomy, contact semantics, and functional affordance. To address these limitations, we present OmniDexVLG, a multimodal, semantics aware grasp generation framework capable of producing structurally diverse and semantically coherent dexterous grasps under joint language and visual guidance. Our approach begins with OmniDexDataGen, a semantic rich dexterous grasp dataset generation pipeline that integrates grasp taxonomy guided configuration sampling, functional affordance contact point sampling, taxonomy aware differential force closure grasp sampling, and physics based optimization and validation, enabling systematic coverage of diverse grasp types. We further introduce OmniDexReasoner, a multimodal grasp type semantic reasoning module that leverages multi agent collaboration, retrieval augmented generation, and chain of thought reasoning to infer grasp related semantics and generate high quality annotations that align language instructions with task specific grasp intent. Building upon these components, we develop a unified Vision Language Grasping generation model that explicitly incorporates grasp taxonomy, contact structure, and functional affordance semantics, enabling fine grained control over grasp synthesis from natural language instructions.

However, this approach faces significant computational challenges stemming from high sequencing noise, low viral coverage, fragmented reads, and the complete absence of labeled variant annotations. Traditional reference-based variant calling pipelines struggle with novel mutations and require extensive computational resources. We present a comprehensive framework for unsupervised viral variant detection using Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAE) that learns discrete codebooks of genomic patterns from k-mer tokenized sequences without requiring reference genomes or variant labels. Our approach extends the base VQ-VAE architecture with masked reconstruction pretraining for robustness to missing data and contrastive learning for highly discriminative embeddings. Evaluated on SARS-CoV-2 wastewater sequencing data comprising approximately 100,000 reads, our VQ-VAE achieves 99.52% mean token-level accuracy and 56.33% exact sequence match rate while maintaining 19.73% codebook utilization (101 of 512 codes active), demonstrating efficient discrete representation learning. Contrastive fine-tuning with different projection dimensions yields substantial clustering improvements: 64-dimensional embeddings achieve +35% Silhouette score improvement (0.31 to 0.42), while 128-dimensional embeddings achieve +42% improvement (0.31 to 0.44), clearly demonstrating the impact of embedding dimensionality on variant discrimination capability.

We present a label-efficient framework that leverages spatial features from a frozen diffusion model pretrained on natural images. Our approach extracts low-level representations from high-resolution decoder layers at early denoising timesteps, which transfer effectively to the low-texture structure of HSI. To integrate spectral and spatial information, we introduce a lightweight FiLM-based fusion module that adaptively modulates frozen spatial features using spectral cues, enabling robust multimodal learning under sparse supervision. Experiments on two recent hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches using only the provided sparse training labels. Ablation studies further highlight the benefits of diffusion-derived features and spectral-aware fusion. Overall, our results indicate that pretrained diffusion models can support domain-agnostic, label-efficient representation learning for remote sensing and broader scientific imaging tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u51bb\u7ed3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u9ad8\u6548\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u6807\u6ce8\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\uff08HSI\uff09\u7684\u5730\u7269\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u65e9\u671f\u53bb\u566a\u5c42\u63d0\u53d6\u4f4e\u7ea7\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f7b\u91cfFiLM\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\u5149\u8c31\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u6210\u50cf\uff08HSI\uff09\u867d\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5730\u7269\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u4f46\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u4e24\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6807\u7b7e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u51bb\u7ed3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u5176\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u4e2d\u7684\u4f4e\u7ea7\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7FiLM\uff08Feature-wise Linear Modulation\uff09\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4ee5\u5149\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u5236\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5149\u8c31-\u7a7a\u95f4\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6700\u65b0\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u539f\u59cb\u7a00\u758f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6807\u7b7e\u5373\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u5149\u8c31\u611f\u77e5\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u3001\u6807\u7b7e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9065\u611f\u53ca\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u6210\u50cf\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

However, LLM output - here, the category assigned to a text - depends heavily on the wording of the prompt. While literature on prompt engineering is expanding, few studies focus on classification tasks, and even fewer address domains like psychology, where constructs have precise, theory-driven definitions that may not be well represented in pre-training data. We present an empirical framework for optimizing LLM performance for identifying constructs in texts via prompt engineering. We experimentally evaluate five prompting strategies --codebook-guided empirical prompt selection, automatic prompt engineering, persona prompting, chain-of-thought reasoning, and explanatory prompting - with zero-shot and few-shot classification. We find that persona, chain-of-thought, and explanations do not fully address performance loss accompanying a badly worded prompt. Instead, the most influential features of a prompt are the construct definition, task framing, and, to a lesser extent, the examples provided. Across three constructs and two models, the classifications most aligned with expert judgments resulted from a few-shot prompt combining codebook-guided empirical prompt selection with automatic prompt engineering. Based on our findings, we recommend that researchers generate and evaluate as many prompt variants as feasible, whether human-crafted, automatically generated, or ideally both, and select prompts and examples based on empirical performance in a training dataset, validating the final approach in a holdout set. This procedure offers a practical, systematic, and theory-driven method for optimizing LLM prompts in settings where alignment with expert judgment is critical.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u6784\u5ff5\u6587\u672c\u8bc6\u522b\u7684LLM\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e94\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f16\u7801\u624b\u518c\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u6784\u5ff5\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8f93\u51fa\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u8868\u8ff0\uff1b\u800c\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u7b49\u7406\u8bba\u9a71\u52a8\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\uff0c\u6784\u5ff5\u5b9a\u4e49\u7cbe\u786e\u4e14\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5145\u5206\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u7f16\u7801\u624b\u518c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u63d0\u793a\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u3001\u89d2\u8272\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u63d0\u793a\uff09\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0b\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e09\u4e2a\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u6784\u5ff5\u548c\u4e24\u4e2aLLM\u3002", "result": "\u89d2\u8272\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u5f25\u8865\u4e0d\u826f\u63d0\u793a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u6700\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u662f\u6784\u5ff5\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5176\u6b21\u4e3a\u793a\u4f8b\uff1b\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u6765\u81ea\u7ed3\u5408\u7f16\u7801\u624b\u518c\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e0e\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a8\u8350\u91c7\u7528\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u751f\u6210\u5927\u91cf\u63d0\u793a\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b5b\u9009\u3001\u5728\u9884\u7559\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7406\u8bba\u9a71\u52a8\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u4e14\u8d34\u8fd1\u4e13\u5bb6\u5224\u65ad\u7684LLM\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

In the meantime, they do not give the user any hints as to whether their reasoning is on the right track, and do not give the user any recourse to stop and correct them if their reasoning is flawed. This creates a frustrating, but unfortunately common, experience: the user's time is wasted while the model reasons from a false premise that could have easily been corrected. In contrast, human speakers typically perform lightweight, incremental grounding acts to ensure that participants in the conversation are on the same page; here we ask if language models can learn to leverage a similar type of behavior? With this motivation, we propose interleaved reasoning (IR), in which the model alternates between thinking and surfacing intermediate responses, as an alternative to the standard \"think-then-answer\" approach. By providing useful information to the user earlier, IR reduces perceived latency, the time a user waits for an initial output, without compromising the quality of the final response. We further introduce a specialization of interleaved reasoning, Plantain (Plan-Thought-Answer Interleaving), where the first intermediate response is an explicit, step-by-step plan for executing the task. This plan-first strategy allows for user intervention and early feedback for subsequent reasoning steps. We demonstrate that Plantain yields an ~6% improvement in pass@1 across several challenging math reasoning and coding benchmarks, while reducing time-to-first-response by over 60% relative to think-then-answer baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4ea4\u9519\u63a8\u7406\uff08IR\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8ba9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u601d\u8003\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4ea4\u66ff\u8f93\u51fa\u4e2d\u95f4\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u7528\u6237\u611f\u77e5\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5e76\u5141\u8bb8\u65e9\u671f\u5e72\u9884\uff1b\u5176\u4e2dPlantain\u53d8\u4f53\u901a\u8fc7\u9996\u5148\u751f\u6210\u660e\u786e\u7684\u5206\u6b65\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7f16\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff08pass@1\u63d0\u5347\u7ea66%\uff09\u5e76\u5927\u5e45\u7f29\u77ed\u9996\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\uff08\u51cf\u5c11\u8d8560%\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u2018\u5148\u601d\u8003\u540e\u56de\u7b54\u2019\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7528\u6237\u65e0\u6cd5\u83b7\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u8fdb\u5c55\u3001\u65e0\u6cd5\u53ca\u65f6\u7ea0\u6b63\u9519\u8bef\u524d\u63d0\u6240\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6d6a\u8d39\u4e0e\u4f53\u9a8c\u4e0d\u4f73\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4ea4\u9519\u63a8\u7406\uff08IR\uff09\uff0c\u5373\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4ea4\u66ff\u8fdb\u884c\u601d\u8003\u4e0e\u8f93\u51fa\u4e2d\u95f4\u54cd\u5e94\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bbe\u8ba1Plantain\uff08Plan-Thought-Answer Interleaving\uff09\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u9996\u4e2a\u4e2d\u95f4\u54cd\u5e94\u4e3a\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u5206\u6b65\u6267\u884c\u8ba1\u5212\u3002", "result": "Plantain\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9ad8\u96be\u5ea6\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u7f16\u7a0b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ea66%\u7684pass@1\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u9996\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5bf9\u57fa\u7ebf\u51cf\u5c11\u8d8560%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ea4\u9519\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662fPlan-first\u7684Plantain\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3001\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u4e0e\u54cd\u5e94\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Under Review", "summary": "Vision-language pretraining (VLP) has emerged as a powerful paradigm in medical image analysis, enabling representation learning from large-scale image-text pairs without relying on expensive manual annotations. However, existing methods often struggle with the noise inherent in web-collected data and the complexity of unstructured long medical texts. To address these challenges, we propose a novel VLP framework integrating a Multi-Agent data GENeration (MAGEN) system and Ontology-based Multi-Aspect Knowledge-Enhanced (O-MAKE) pretraining. First, MAGEN enhances data quality by synthesizing knowledge-enriched descriptions via a foundation model-assisted captioning and retrieval-based verification pipeline. Second, O-MAKE addresses the difficulty of learning from long, unstructured texts by decomposing them into distinct knowledge aspects. This facilitates fine-grained alignment at both global and patch levels, while explicitly modeling medical concept relationships through ontology-guided mechanisms. We validate our framework in the field of dermatology, where comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each component. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on disease classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks across eight datasets.

The goal of this paper is to teach LLMs to follow medical consensus guidelines step-by-step in their reasoning and prediction process. Since consensus guidelines are ubiquitous in medicine, instantiations of verbalized medical inference rules to electronic health records provide data for fine-tuning LLMs to learn consensus rules and possible exceptions thereof for many medical areas. Consensus rules also enable an automatic evaluation of the model's inference process regarding its derivation correctness (evaluating correct and faithful deduction of a conclusion from given premises) and value correctness (comparing predicted values against real-world measurements). We exemplify our work using the complex Sepsis-3 consensus definition. Our experiments show that small fine-tuned models outperform one-shot learning of considerably larger LLMs that are prompted with the explicit definition and models that are trained on medical texts including consensus definitions. Since fine-tuning on verbalized rule instantiations of a specific medical area yields nearly perfect derivation correctness for rules (and exceptions) on unseen patient data in that area, the bottleneck for early prediction is not out-of-distribution generalization, but the orthogonal problem of generalization into the future by forecasting sparsely and irregularly sampled clinical variables. We show that the latter results can be improved by integrating the output representations of a time series forecasting model with the LLM in a multimodal setup.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u533b\u5b66\u5171\u8bc6\u6307\u5357\uff08\u5982Sepsis-3\uff09\u4ee5\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u89c4\u5219\u5f62\u5f0f\u6ce8\u5165LLM\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u5206\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u5e76\u4fdd\u8bc1\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e0e\u6570\u503c\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u901a\u7528\u533b\u5b66\u6587\u672c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u74f6\u9888\u5728\u4e8e\u65f6\u5e8f\u5916\u63a8\u800c\u975e\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u533b\u5b66\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5173\u6ce8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u4e34\u5e8a\u5171\u8bc6\u6307\u5357\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u9075\u5faa\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u533b\u751f\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u533b\u5b66\u5171\u8bc6\u6307\u5357\uff08\u5982Sepsis-3\uff09\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684\u3001\u9762\u5411\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u8a00\u8bed\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u5c0f\u578bLLM\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u63a8\u5bfc\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff08\u903b\u8f91\u6f14\u7ece\uff09\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff08\u9884\u6d4b\u503c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u771f\u5b9e\u503c\uff09\u53cc\u7ef4\u5ea6\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u67b6\u6784\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u7a00\u758f\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u4e34\u5e8a\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u672a\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684\u5c0f\u578bLLM\u5728\u63a8\u5bfc\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b8c\u7f8e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u533b\u5b66\u6587\u672c\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u74f6\u9888\u88ab\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e3a\u2018\u9762\u5411\u672a\u6765\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u2019\uff08\u5373\u65f6\u5e8f\u5916\u63a8\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4f20\u7edfOOD\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u878d\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u540e\uff0c\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u4e34\u5e8a\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u5f97\u5230\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u533b\u5b66\u5171\u8bc6\u89c4\u5219\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u5e76\u878d\u5165LLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u53ef\u517c\u987e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff1b\u89e3\u51b3\u4e34\u5e8a\u65f6\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u4e0e\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u91c7\u6837\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Recent advances in digital twins (DTs) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) offer new opportunities for real-time, data-driven optimization across a vehicle's lifecycle. However, integrating these technologies into a unified framework remains an open challenge. This work presents a DT-based control co-design (CCD) framework for full-vehicle active suspensions using multi-generation design concepts. By integrating automatic differentiation into DRL, we jointly optimize physical suspension components and control policies under varying driver behaviors and environmental uncertainties. DRL also addresses the challenge of partial observability, where only limited states can be sensed and fed back to the controller, by learning optimal control actions directly from available sensor information. The framework incorporates model updating with quantile learning to capture data uncertainty, enabling real-time decision-making and adaptive learning from digital-physical interactions. The approach demonstrates personalized optimization of suspension systems under two distinct driving settings (mild and aggressive). Results show that the optimized systems achieve smoother trajectories and reduce control efforts by approximately 43% and 52% for mild and aggressive, respectively, while maintaining ride comfort and stability. Contributions include: developing a DT-enabled CCD framework integrating DRL and uncertainty-aware model updating for full-vehicle active suspensions, introducing a multi-generation design strategy for self-improving systems, and demonstrating personalized optimization of active suspension systems for distinct driver types.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\uff08DT\uff09\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DRL\uff09\u7684\u63a7\u5236-\u7ed3\u6784\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08CCD\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5168\u8f66\u4e3b\u52a8\u60ac\u67b6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u4ee3\u81ea\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u9002\u914d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4e3b\u52a8\u60ac\u67b6\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u5de5\u51b5\uff1b\u73b0\u6709DT\u4e0eDRL\u878d\u5408\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6210\u719f\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u3001\u652f\u6301\u5168\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaDT\u9a71\u52a8\u7684CCD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u5206\u589e\u5f3a\u7684DRL\u5b9e\u73b0\u60ac\u67b6\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ebf\u66f4\u65b0\uff1b\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u6709\u9650\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6e29\u548c\u4e0e\u6fc0\u8fdb\u4e24\u79cd\u9a7e\u9a76\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u5206\u522b\u964d\u4f4e\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u8017\u7ea643%\u548c52%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e58\u5750\u8212\u9002\u6027\u4e0e\u884c\u9a76\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u60ac\u67b6\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u9996\u6b21\u5c06DT\u3001DRL\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u6df1\u5ea6\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e3b\u52a8\u60ac\u67b6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u591a\u4ee3\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u4e0e\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u9002\u914d\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u5e95\u76d8\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Most existing work relies on manual ROIs and rarely reports quality control (QC). We present LM-CartSeg, a fully automatic pipeline for cartilage/bone segmentation, geometric lateral/medial (L/M) compartmentalisation and radiomics analysis. Methods: Two 3D nnU-Net models were trained on SKM-TEA (138 knees) and OAIZIB-CM (404 knees). At test time, zero-shot predictions were fused and refined by simple geometric rules: connected-component cleaning, construction of 10 mm subchondral bone bands in physical space, and a data-driven tibial L/M split based on PCA and k-means. Segmentation was evaluated on an OAIZIB-CM test set (103 knees) and on SKI-10 (100 knees). QC used volume and thickness signatures. From 10 ROIs we extracted 4 650 non-shape radiomic features to study inter-compartment similarity, dependence on ROI size, and OA vs. non-OA classification on OAIZIB-CM Results: Post-processing improved macro ASSD on OAIZIB-CM from 2.63 to 0.36 mm and HD95 from 25.2 to 3.35 mm, with DSC 0.91; zero-shot DSC on SKI-10 was 0.80. The geometric L/M rule produced stable compartments across datasets, whereas a direct L/M nnU-Net showed domain-dependent side swaps. Only 6 to 12 percent of features per ROI were strongly correlated with volume or thickness. Radiomics-based models models restricted to size-linked features.

Although Cross-layer KV Cache sharing (e.g., YOCO, CLA) offers a path to mitigate KV Cache bottleneck, it typically underperforms within-layer methods like GQA. To understand the root cause, we investigate the information flow of keys and values of the top-layers. Our preliminary reveals a clear distribution: values are predominantly derived from the bottom layer, while keys draw more information from both bottom and middle layers. Building upon this, we propose FusedKV, whose top-layer KV caches are a learnable fusion of the most informative ones from the bottom and middle layers. This fusion operates directly on post-RoPE keys, preserving relative positional information without the computational cost of re-applying rotary embeddings. To further improve efficiency, we propose FusedKV-Lite, an cross-layer sharing approach, where top-layer KV caches are directly derived from the bottom-layer values and the middle-layer keys. Compared to FusedKV, FusedKV-Lite reduces I/O overhead at the cost of a slight increase in perplexity. In experiments on LLMs ranging from 332M to 4B parameters, our proposed method reduce 50\\% cache memory while achieving lower validation perplexity than the standard Transformer decoder, establishing it as a memory-efficient, high-performance architectural alternative.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFusedKV\u548cFusedKV-Lite\u4e24\u79cd\u8de8\u5c42KV\u7f13\u5b58\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u5e95\u5c42\u4e0e\u4e2d\u5c42\u7684\u952e\u503c\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5728\u51cf\u5c1150% KV\u7f13\u5b58\u5185\u5b58\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6Transformer\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8de8\u5c42KV\u7f13\u5b58\u5171\u4eab\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982YOCO\u3001CLA\uff09\u6027\u80fd\u5f31\u4e8e\u540c\u5c42\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982GQA\uff09\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7a76\u5176\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u9876\u5c42KV\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u6e90\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u503c\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u81ea\u5e95\u5c42\u3001\u952e\u6765\u81ea\u5e95\u5c42\u4e0e\u4e2d\u5c42\uff1b\u636e\u6b64\u63d0\u51faFusedKV\uff08\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u878d\u5408\u5e95\u5c42\u4e0e\u4e2d\u5c42KV\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5728RoPE\u540e\u952e\u4e0a\u64cd\u4f5c\uff09\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7248FusedKV-Lite\uff08\u76f4\u63a5\u590d\u7528\u5e95\u5c42\u503c\u4e0e\u4e2d\u5c42\u952e\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728332M\u81f34B\u53c2\u6570LLM\u4e0a\uff0cKV\u7f13\u5b58\u5185\u5b58\u51cf\u5c1150%\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u4f4e\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6Transformer\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "FusedKV\u7cfb\u5217\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u517c\u987e\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684Transformer\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u65b0\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}}

In this paper, we argue that language models should aim to capture the full spectrum of language variation (dialectal, historical, informal, etc.) rather than relying solely on standardized text. Focusing on Basque, a morphologically rich and low-resource language, we construct new corpora combining standard, social media, and historical sources, and pre-train the BERnaT family of encoder-only models in three configurations: standard, diverse, and combined. We further propose an evaluation framework that separates Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks into standard and diverse subsets to assess linguistic generalization. Results show that models trained on both standard and diverse data consistently outperform those trained on standard corpora, improving performance across all task types without compromising standard benchmark accuracy.

However, these failures encode where and how policies can be fragile, information that can be exploited to improve robustness. We address this problem by leveraging mixed-quality datasets to learn failure-aware reasoning at planning time. We introduce VINE, a hierarchical vision-language-action model that separates high-level reasoning (System 2) from low-level control (System 1) under a hierarchical reinforcement learning formalism, making failures usable as a structured learning signal rather than noisy supervision. System 2 performs feasibility-guided tree search over a 2D scene-graph abstraction: it proposes subgoal transitions, predicts success probabilities from both successes and failures, and prunes brittle branches before execution, effectively casting plan evaluation as feasibility scoring.

Modern motion predictors offer highly accurate forecasts, yet their integration into planning is mostly rudimental: discarding unsafe plans. Similarly, end-to-end models offer a one-way integration that avoids the challenges of joint prediction and planning modeling under uncertainty. In contrast, game-theoretic formulations offer a principled alternative but have seen limited adoption in autonomous driving. We present Bayesian Iterative Best Response (BIBeR), a framework that unifies motion prediction and game-theoretic planning into a single interaction-aware process. BIBeR is the first to integrate a state-of-the-art predictor into an Iterative Best Response (IBR) loop, repeatedly refining the strategies of the ego vehicle and surrounding agents. This repeated best-response process approximates a Nash equilibrium, enabling bidirectional adaptation where the ego both reacts to and shapes the behavior of others. In addition, our proposed Bayesian confidence estimation quantifies prediction reliability and modulates update strength, more conservative under low confidence and more decisive under high confidence. BIBeR is compatible with modern predictors and planners, combining the transparency of structured planning with the flexibility of learned models. Experiments show that BIBeR achieves an 11% improvement over state-of-the-art planners on highly interactive interPlan lane-change scenarios, while also outperforming existing approaches on standard nuPlan benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faBIBeR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u4e0e\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u89c4\u5212\uff08\u8fed\u4ee3\u6700\u4f18\u54cd\u5e94\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53cc\u5411\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u66f4\u65b0\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u89c4\u5212\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u89c4\u5212\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5e38\u89c4\u573a\u666f\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u57ce\u5e02\u4ea4\u901a\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u9700\u9884\u5224\u548c\u5f71\u54cd\u4ed6\u8f66\u7684\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\uff08\u5982\u53d8\u9053\u3001\u6c47\u5165\uff09\uff1b\u5f53\u524d\u9884\u6d4b-\u89c4\u5212\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u5f0f\u7c97\u7cd9\uff08\u4ec5\u7b5b\u9664\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u65b9\u6848\uff09\u6216\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u9ed1\u7bb1\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u539f\u7406\u4e25\u8c28\u5374\u5e94\u7528\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8fed\u4ee3\u6700\u4f18\u54cd\u5e94\uff08BIBeR\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5728\u8fed\u4ee3\u6700\u4f18\u54cd\u5e94\uff08IBR\uff09\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u5148\u8fdb\u8fd0\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u53cd\u590d\u4f18\u5316\u81ea\u8f66\u4e0e\u5468\u56f4\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff1b\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u73b0\u4ee3\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9ad8\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684interPlan\u53d8\u9053\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0cBIBeR\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u63d0\u534711%\uff1b\u5728\u6807\u51c6nuPlan\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u4e5f\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "BIBeR\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u4e0e\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u534f\u540c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u7f6e\u4fe1\u611f\u77e5\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u901a\u4ea4\u4e92\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, most existing approaches operate purely in the 2D pixel space and lack explicit mechanisms for modeling 3D structures, often resulting in temporally inconsistent geometries, implausible motions, and structural artifacts. In this work, we introduce geometric regularization losses into video generation by augmenting latent diffusion models with per-frame depth prediction. We adopted depth as the geometric representation because of the great progress in depth prediction and its compatibility with image-based latent encoders. Specifically, to enforce structural consistency over time, we propose a multi-view geometric loss that aligns the predicted depth maps across frames within a shared 3D coordinate system. Our method bridges the gap between appearance generation and 3D structure modeling, leading to improved spatio-temporal coherence, shape consistency, and physical plausibility.

This work presents a two-stage adaptation of Qwen2.5-3B to Tibetan, a morphologically rich and underrepresented language. We employ Continual Pretraining (CPT) to establish Tibetan linguistic grounding, followed by Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for task and translation specialization. Empirical evaluations demonstrate a consistent decrease in perplexity (from 2.98 $\\rightarrow$ 1.54) and substantial improvements in Chinese$\\rightarrow$Tibetan translation quality (BLEU: 0.046 $\\rightarrow$ 0.261; chrF: 2.2 $\\rightarrow$ 6.6). Layer-wise analysis across 435 layers in Qwen3-4B reveals that adaptation primarily concentrates on embedding and output heads, with mid--late MLP projections encoding domain-specific transformations. Our findings suggest that CPT constructs a Tibetan semantic manifold while SFT sharpens task alignment with minimal representational disruption. This study provides the first quantitative exploration of Tibetan adaptation dynamics for LLMs, and offers an open, reproducible framework for extending multilingual foundation models to low-resource settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3CPT + \u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03SFT\uff09\u5c06Qwen2.5-3B\u9002\u914d\u81f3\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u3001\u5f62\u6001\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u85cf\u8bed\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u4e2d\u2192\u85cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u9002\u5e94\u4e3b\u8981\u53d1\u751f\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u5c42\u3001\u8f93\u51fa\u5934\u53ca\u4e2d\u540e\u6bb5MLP\u5c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982\u85cf\u8bed\uff09\u4e0a\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6f02\u79fb\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9002\u914d\u96be\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u9002\u914d\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4e3a\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08CPT\uff09\u4ee5\u5efa\u7acb\u85cf\u8bed\u8bed\u8a00\u57fa\u7840\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u4e3a\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4e2d\u2192\u85cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff09\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5c42\u7ea7\u522b\u5206\u6790\uff08\u57fa\u4e8eQwen3-4B\u7684435\u5c42\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff082.98 \u2192 1.54\uff09\uff1b\u4e2d\u2192\u85cf\u7ffb\u8bd1BLEU\u4ece0.046\u63d0\u5347\u81f30.261\uff0cchrF\u4ece2.2\u63d0\u5347\u81f36.6\uff1b\u5c42\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u9002\u5e94\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u5c42\u3001\u8f93\u51fa\u5934\u53ca\u4e2d\u540e\u6bb5MLP\u5c42\u3002", "conclusion": "CPT\u6784\u5efa\u85cf\u8bed\u8bed\u4e49\u6d41\u5f62\uff0cSFT\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e14\u6270\u52a8\u6700\u5c0f\uff1b\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9a\u91cf\u523b\u753b\u4e86LLM\u85cf\u8bed\u9002\u914d\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f00\u6e90\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u6269\u5c55\u3002"}}

The AgriVLN method and the A2A benchmark pioneeringly extend Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) to the agricultural domain, enabling a robot to navigate to a target position following a natural language instruction. Unlike human binocular vision, most agricultural robots are only given a single camera for monocular vision, which results in limited spatial perception. To bridge this gap, we present the method of Agricultural Vision-and-Language Navigation with Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE-AgriVLN), in which we propose the MDE module generating depth features from RGB images, to assist the decision-maker on reasoning. When evaluated on the A2A benchmark, our MDE-AgriVLN method successfully increases Success Rate from 0.23 to 0.32 and decreases Navigation Error from 4.43m to 4.08m, demonstrating the state-of-the-art performance in the agricultural VLN domain.

We propose SPARK: a three-stage framework where in the first stage a generator model produces diverse solutions and a verifier model evaluates them using parallel scaling (self-consistency) and sequential scaling (meta-critique). In the second stage, we use these verification outputs as synthetic training data to fine-tune generative process reward models, which subsequently serve as reward signals during training. We show that aggregating multiple independent verifications at the step level produces training data for process reward models that surpass ground-truth outcome supervision, achieving 67.5 F1 on ProcessBench (a benchmark for identifying erroneous steps in mathematical reasoning) compared to 66.4 for reference-guided training and 61.9 for GPT-4o. In the final stage, we apply our generative PRM with chain-of-thought verification (PRM-CoT) as the reward model in RL experiments on mathematical reasoning, and introduce format constraints to prevent reward hacking.

Existing visual grounding (VG) methods for autonomous vehicles (AVs) typically struggle with ambiguous, context-dependent instructions, as they lack reasoning over 3D spatial relations and anticipated scene evolution. Grounded in the principles of world models, we propose ThinkDeeper, a framework that reasons about future spatial states before making grounding decisions. At its core is a Spatial-Aware World Model (SA-WM) that learns to reason ahead by distilling the current scene into a command-aware latent state and rolling out a sequence of future latent states, providing forward-looking cues for disambiguation. Complementing this, a hypergraph-guided decoder then hierarchically fuses these states with the multimodal input, capturing higher-order spatial dependencies for robust localization.

The common approach to extension trains a new tokenizer on domain-specific text and appends the tokens that do not overlap with the existing vocabulary, which often results in many tokens that are unreachable or never used. We propose continued BPE training, which adapts a pre-trained tokenizer by continuing the BPE merge learning process on new data. Experiments across multiple languages and model families show that this approach improves tokenization efficiency and leads to better utilization of added vocabulary. We also introduce leaf-based vocabulary pruning, which removes redundant tokens while preserving model quality.

However, many VLMs exhibit reduced factual recall performance compared to their LLM backbones, raising the question of how effective multimodal fine-tuning is at extending existing mechanisms within the LLM to visual inputs. We argue that factual recall based on visual inputs requires VLMs to solve a two-hop problem: (1) forming entity representations from visual inputs, and (2) recalling associated factual knowledge based on these entity representations. By benchmarking 14 VLMs with various architectures (LLaVA, Native, Cross-Attention), sizes (7B-124B parameters), and training setups on factual recall tasks against their original LLM backbone models, we find that 11 of 14 models exhibit factual recall degradation. We select three models with high and two models with low performance degradation, and use attribution patching, activation patching, and probing to show that degraded VLMs struggle to use the existing factual recall circuit of their LLM backbone, because they resolve the first hop too late in the computation. In contrast, high-performing VLMs resolve entity representations early enough to reuse the existing factual recall mechanism. Finally, we demonstrate two methods to recover performance: patching entity representations from the LLM backbone into the VLM, and prompting with chain-of-thought reasoning. Our results highlight that the speed of early entity resolution critically determines how effective VLMs are in using preexisting LLM mechanisms.

However, achieving practical performance typically requires task-specific fine-tuning with large numbers of image-text pairs, which are costly to collect. In this work, we study text-centric training, a setting where only textual descriptions are available and no real images are provided, as a paradigm for low-cost data scaling. Unlike images, whose collection is often restricted by privacy constraints and scarcity in niche domains, text is widely available. Moreover, text is easily editable, enabling automatic diversification and expansion with LLMs at minimal human effort. While this offers clear advantages over image collection in terms of scalability and cost, training on raw text without images still yields limited gains on VQA tasks because of the image-text modality gap. To address this issue, we propose a Text-Printed Image (TPI), which generates synthetic images by directly rendering the given textual description on a plain white canvas. This simple rendering projects text into the image modality and can be integrated into arbitrary existing LVLM training pipelines at low cost. Moreover, TPI preserves the semantics of the text, whereas text-to-image models often fail to do. Across four models and seven benchmarks, our systematic experiments show that TPI enables more effective text-centric training than synthetic images generated by a diffusion model. We further explore TPI as a low-cost data-augmentation strategy and demonstrate its practical utility. Overall, our findings highlight the significant potential of text-centric training and, more broadly, chart a path toward fully automated data generation for LVLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aText-Printed Image\uff08TPI\uff09\u7684\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u76f4\u63a5\u6e32\u67d3\u4e3a\u767d\u5e95\u56fe\u50cf\u6765\u5f25\u5408\u56fe\u6587\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LVLMs\uff09\u5728VQA\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u6216\u590d\u6742\u5408\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LVLMs\u5728VQA\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u5e26\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u8fdb\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4f46\u56fe\u50cf\u91c7\u96c6\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u9690\u79c1\u3001\u7a00\u7f3a\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\uff1b\u800c\u6587\u672c\u66f4\u6613\u83b7\u53d6\u3001\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u5229\u7528\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f4e\u4ee3\u4ef7\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faText-Printed Image\uff08TPI\uff09\uff1a\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u6587\u672c\u76f4\u63a5\u6e32\u67d3\u4e3a\u767d\u5e95RGB\u56fe\u50cf\uff08\u5373\u6587\u5b57\u622a\u56fe\uff09\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u6001\u4ee3\u7406\uff1b\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u53ef\u63d2\u62d4\uff0c\u517c\u5bb9\u4efb\u610fLVLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u9ad8\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u57284\u4e2aLVLM\u548c7\u4e2aVQA\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cTPI\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "TPI\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3aLVLMs\u8fc8\u5411\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u3001\u96f6\u56fe\u50cf\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

To achieve this, inference systems must maximize request handling within latency constraints, referred to as increasing effective throughput. However, existing systems face two major challenges: (i) reliance on first-come-first-served (FCFS) scheduling causes severe head-of-line blocking, leading to queuing delays exceeding the SLOs for many requests; and (ii) static batch token limit, which fails to adapt to fluctuating loads and hardware conditions. Both of these factors degrade effective throughput and service quality.\n  This paper presents AugServe, an efficient inference framework designed to reduce queueing latency and enhance effective throughput for augmented LLM inference services. The core idea of AugServe is a two-stage adaptive request scheduling strategy. Specifically, AugServe combines the inference features of augmented LLM requests to optimize the order of scheduling decisions (stage I). These decisions are continuously refined with runtime information (stage II), adapting to both request characteristics and system capabilities. In addition, AugServe dynamically adjusts the token batching mechanism based on hardware status and real-time load, further enhancing throughput performance. Experimental results show that AugServe achieves 4.7-33.1x and 3.3-13.2x higher effective throughput than vLLM and InferCept, while reducing time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 96.3% and 95.0%, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAugServe\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bf7\u6c42\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001token\u6279\u5904\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u6548\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u9996\u5b57\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u4f18\u4e8evLLM\u548cInferCept\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u589e\u5f3a\u578bLLM\u63a8\u7406\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34FCFS\u8c03\u5ea6\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u961f\u5934\u963b\u585e\u548c\u9759\u6001token\u6279\u5904\u7406\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3SLO\u8981\u6c42\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0e\u786c\u4ef6\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u635f\u5bb3\u6709\u6548\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAugServe\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bf7\u6c42\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u2014\u2014\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bf7\u6c42\u63a8\u7406\u7279\u5f81\u4f18\u5316\u8c03\u5ea6\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u5229\u7528\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u4fe1\u606f\u6301\u7eed\u8c03\u6574\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u6839\u636e\u786c\u4ef6\u72b6\u6001\u4e0e\u5b9e\u65f6\u8d1f\u8f7d\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574token\u6279\u5904\u7406\u5927\u5c0f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAugServe\u76f8\u8f83vLLM\u548cInferCept\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u53474.7\u201333.1\u500d\u548c3.3\u201313.2\u500d\uff0c\u9996\u5b57\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff08TTFT\uff09\u6700\u591a\u964d\u4f4e96.3%\u548c95.0%\u3002", "conclusion": "AugServe\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u6279\u5904\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u589e\u5f3a\u578bLLM\u670d\u52a1\u5728\u4e25\u82dbSLO\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We introduce BlendedNet++, a large-scale aerodynamic dataset and benchmark focused on blended wing body (BWB) aircraft. The dataset contains over 12,000 unique geometries, each simulated at a single flight condition, yielding 12,490 aerodynamic results for steady RANS CFD. For every case, we provide (i) integrated force/moment coefficients CL, CD, CM and (ii) dense surface fields of pressure and skin friction coefficients Cp and (Cfx, Cfy, Cfz). Using this dataset, we standardize a forward-surrogate benchmark to predict pointwise fields across six model families: GraphSAGE, GraphUNet, PointNet, a coordinate Transformer (Transolver-style), a FiLMNet (coordinate MLP with feature-wise modulation), and a Graph Neural Operator Transformer (GNOT). Finally, we present an inverse design task of achieving a specified lift-to-drag ratio under fixed flight conditions, implemented via a conditional diffusion model. To assess performance, we benchmark this approach against gradient-based optimization on the same surrogate and a diffusion-optimization hybrid that first samples with the conditional diffusion model and then further optimizes the designs.

To enhance targets and suppress backgrounds, we propose the Basis Decomposition Module (BDM) as an extensible and lightweight module based on basis decomposition, which decomposes a complex feature into several basis features and enhances certain information while eliminating redundancy. Extending BDM leads to a series of modules, including the Spatial Difference Decomposition Module (SD$^\\mathrm{2}$M), Spatial Difference Decomposition Downsampling Module (SD$^\\mathrm{3}$M), and Temporal Difference Decomposition Module (TD$^\\mathrm{2}$M). Based on these modules, we develop the Spatial Difference Decomposition Network (SD$^\\mathrm{2}$Net) for single-frame ISTD (SISTD) and the Spatiotemporal Difference Decomposition Network (STD$^\\mathrm{2}$Net) for multi-frame ISTD (MISTD). SD$^\\mathrm{2}$Net integrates SD$^\\mathrm{2}$M and SD$^\\mathrm{3}$M within an adapted U-shaped architecture. We employ TD$^\\mathrm{2}$M to introduce motion information, which transforms SD$^\\mathrm{2}$Net into STD$^\\mathrm{2}$Net. Extensive experiments on SISTD and MISTD datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. On the SISTD task, SD$^\\mathrm{2}$Net performs well compared to most established networks. On the MISTD datasets, STD$^\\mathrm{2}$Net achieves a mIoU of 87.68\\%, outperforming SD$^\\mathrm{2}$Net, which achieves a mIoU of 64.97\\%.

Existing approaches primarily analyze how an action is performed, while overlooking what it produces, i.e., the \\textbf{action effect}. Yet many errors manifest not in the execution itself but in the resulting outcome, such as an unintended object state or incorrect spatial arrangement. To address this gap, we propose Action Effect Modeling (AEM), a unified framework that jointly captures action execution and its outcomes through a probabilistic formulation. AEM first identifies the outcome of an action by selecting the most informative effect frame based on semantic relevance and visual quality. It then extracts complementary cues from visual grounding and symbolic scene graphs, aligning them in a shared latent space to form robust effect-aware representations. To detect mistakes, we further design a prompt-based detector that incorporates task-specific prompts and aligns each action segment with its intended execution semantics. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the EgoPER and CaptainCook4D benchmarks under the challenging one-class classification (OCC) setting. These results demonstrate that modeling both execution and outcome yields more reliable mistake detection, and highlight the potential of effect-aware representations to benefit a broader range of downstream applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAction Effect Modeling (AEM)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u52a8\u4f5c\u6267\u884c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ca\u5176\u6548\u679c\uff08action effect\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728EgoPER\u548cCaptainCook4D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u52a8\u4f5c\u5982\u4f55\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u5176\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff08action effect\uff09\uff1b\u8bb8\u591a\u9519\u8bef\u5b9e\u9645\u4f53\u73b0\u5728\u7ed3\u679c\uff08\u5982\u7269\u4f53\u72b6\u6001\u6216\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e03\u5c40\u5f02\u5e38\uff09\u800c\u975e\u6267\u884c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u672c\u8eab\u3002", "method": "AEM\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5177\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u7684\u6548\u679c\u5e27\uff1b2\uff09\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u5316\u573a\u666f\u56fe\uff0c\u5728\u5171\u4eab\u9690\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5bf9\u9f50\u4ee5\u6784\u5efa\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6548\u679c\u611f\u77e5\u8868\u5f81\uff1b3\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\u52a8\u4f5c\u6bb5\u4e0e\u5176\u9884\u671f\u8bed\u4e49\u3002", "result": "\u5728EgoPER\u548cCaptainCook4D\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u4e00\u7c7b\u5206\u7c7b\uff08OCC\uff09\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u540c\u65f6\u5efa\u6a21\u52a8\u4f5c\u6267\u884c\u4e0e\u6548\u679c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9519\u8bef\u68c0\u6d4b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff1b\u6548\u679c\u611f\u77e5\u8868\u5f81\u6709\u671b\u62d3\u5c55\u81f3\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Previous work has shown that when a base language model exhibits these skills, training that model further with reinforcement learning (RL) can learn to leverage them. How can we get models to leverage skills that aren't exhibited by base models? Our work, SkillFactory, is a method for fine-tuning models to roughly learn these skills during a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage prior to RL. Our approach does not rely on distillation from a stronger model, but instead uses samples from the model itself, rearranged to provide training data in the format of those skills. These \"silver\" SFT traces may be imperfect, but are nevertheless effective for priming a model to acquire skills during RL. Our evaluation shows that (1) starting from SkillFactory SFT initialization helps a model to generalize to harder variants of a task post-RL, despite lower performance pre-RL; (2) cognitive skills are indeed used by the model; (3) RLed SkillFactory models are more robust to regression on out-of-domain tasks than RLed base models.

This prior is incorporated via constrained MAP optimization in latent space, ensuring robustness to severe noise and plausible completion in unobserved areas. Initialization uses a robust vectorized mapping module followed by diffusion inversion; optimization employs efficient Gaussian-basis reparameterization, projected gradient descent zobracket multi-start, and latent-space factor-graph for global consistency. For topological mapping, we apply confidence-weighted k-medoids clustering and kinematic refinement to trajectories, yielding smooth, human-like centerlines robust to trajectory variation.

However, they notoriously struggle with stiff, multi-scale, and nonlinear systems due to the inherent spectral bias of standard multilayer perceptron (MLP) architectures, which prevents them from adequately representing high-frequency components. In this work, we introduce the Adaptive Spectral Physics-Enabled Network (ASPEN), a novel architecture designed to overcome this critical limitation. ASPEN integrates an adaptive spectral layer with learnable Fourier features directly into the network's input stage. This mechanism allows the model to dynamically tune its own spectral basis during training, enabling it to efficiently learn and represent the precise frequency content required by the solution. We demonstrate the efficacy of ASPEN by applying it to the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGLE), a canonical and challenging benchmark for nonlinear, stiff spatio-temporal dynamics. Our results show that a standard PINN architecture catastrophically fails on this problem, diverging into non-physical oscillations. In contrast, ASPEN successfully solves the CGLE with exceptional accuracy. The predicted solution is visually indistinguishable from the high-resolution ground truth, achieving a low median physics residual of 5.10 x 10^-3. Furthermore, we validate that ASPEN's solution is not only pointwise accurate but also physically consistent, correctly capturing emergent physical properties, including the rapid free energy relaxation and the long-term stability of the domain wall front. This work demonstrates that by incorporating an adaptive spectral basis, our framework provides a robust and physically-consistent solver for complex dynamical systems where standard PINNs fail, opening new options for machine learning in challenging physical domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edcASPEN\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u5c42\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c31\u5c42\uff08\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u7279\u5f81\uff09\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfPINN\u56e0\u9891\u8c31\u504f\u5dee\u96be\u4ee5\u6c42\u89e3\u521a\u6027\u3001\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u548c\u5f3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027PDE\uff08\u5982\u590dGinzburg-Landau\u65b9\u7a0b\uff09\u7684\u74f6\u9888\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eASPEN\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6PINN\uff0c\u5728CGLE\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfPINN\u53d7\u9650\u4e8eMLP\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u8868\u5f81\u9ad8\u9891\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u6c42\u89e3\u521a\u6027\u3001\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u548c\u5f3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08\u5982CGLE\uff09\u65f6\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faASPEN\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c31\u5c42\uff08\u542b\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8c10\u7684\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u7279\u5f81\uff09\u5d4c\u5165\u7f51\u7edc\u8f93\u5165\u7aef\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u81ea\u4e3b\u8c03\u6574\u8c31\u57fa\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u89e3\u7684\u9891\u7387\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "ASPEN\u6210\u529f\u6c42\u89e3\u590dGinzburg-Landau\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u89e3\u4e0e\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u771f\u503c\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0d\u53ef\u533a\u5206\uff0c\u4e2d\u4f4d\u7269\u7406\u6b8b\u5dee\u4f4e\u81f35.10\u00d710\u207b\u00b3\uff0c\u5e76\u51c6\u786e\u518d\u73b0\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u5f1b\u8c6b\u548c\u7574\u58c1\u524d\u6cbf\u957f\u671f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7b49\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\uff1b\u800c\u6807\u51c6PINN\u5b8c\u5168\u53d1\u6563\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c31\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347PINN\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0cASPEN\u4e3a\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5f3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u3001\u521a\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u7269\u7406\u89e3\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

We introduce fairness-aware Low-Rank Adaptation for medical VLMs, combining parameter efficiency with explicit fairness optimization. Our key algorithmic contribution is a differentiable MaxAccGap loss that enables end-to-end optimization of accuracy parity across demographic groups. We propose three methods: FR-LoRA integrates MaxAccGap regularization into the training objective, GR-LoRA applies inverse frequency weighting to balance gradient contributions, and Hybrid-LoRA combines both mechanisms.Evaluated on 10,000 glaucoma fundus images, GR-LoRA reduces diagnostic accuracy disparities by 69% while maintaining 53.15% overall accuracy. Ablation studies reveal that strong regularization strength achieves optimal fairness with minimal accuracy trade-off, and race-specific optimization yields 60% disparity reduction.

However, current VLAs still struggle to produce consistent and precise target-oriented actions, as they often generate redundant or unstable motions along trajectories, limiting their applicability in time-sensitive scenarios.In this work, we attribute these redundant actions to the spatially uniform perception field of existing VLAs, which causes them to be distracted by target-irrelevant objects, especially in complex environments.To address this issue, we propose an efficient PosA-VLA framework that anchors visual attention via pose-conditioned supervision, consistently guiding the model's perception toward task-relevant regions. The pose-conditioned anchor attention mechanism enables the model to better align instruction semantics with actionable visual cues, thereby improving action generation precision and efficiency. Moreover, our framework adopts a lightweight architecture and requires no auxiliary perception modules (e.g., segmentation or grounding networks), ensuring efficient inference. Extensive experiments verify that our method executes embodied tasks with precise and time-efficient behavior across diverse robotic manipulation benchmarks and shows robust generalization in a variety of challenging environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPosA-VLA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u59ff\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u5347VLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5177\u8eab\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u5f3a\u7b49\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VLA\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u7a7a\u95f4\u5747\u5300\u611f\u77e5\u573a\u6613\u53d7\u65e0\u5173\u7269\u4f53\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u52a8\u4f5c\u5197\u4f59\u3001\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPosA-VLA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u59ff\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u951a\u5b9a\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff08pose-conditioned anchor attention\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5206\u5272\u6216\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7b49\u8f85\u52a9\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u6548\u6027\u548c\u73af\u5883\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u59ff\u6001\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3VLA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u5e72\u6270\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Across synthetic and real datasets, conformalized forecasters achieve near-nominal coverage with competitive accuracy and generally improved band efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5207\u6362\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5171\u5f62\u63a8\u65ad\uff08ACI\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u805a\u5408\u53d8\u4f53\uff08AgACI\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u65e0\u5173\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5171\u5f62\u5305\u88c5\u5668\uff0c\u9002\u914d\u591a\u79cd\u5f3a\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u8bef\u8bbe\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5728\u7ebf\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\u53ca\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u8fb9\u9645\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u9891\u7e41\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u673a\u5236\u8f6c\u6362\u7834\u574f\u4e86\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u6821\u51c6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u70b9\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u540c\u7b49\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6df1\u5ea6\u5207\u6362\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5171\u5f62\u63a8\u65ad\uff08ACI\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u805a\u5408\u53d8\u4f53\uff08AgACI\uff09\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5171\u5f62\u5305\u88c5\u5668\uff0c\u9002\u914dS4\u3001MC-Dropout GRU\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u53d8\u70b9\u5c40\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\u7b49\u5f3a\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5171\u5f62\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1\u6807\u79f0\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u666e\u904d\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u533a\u95f4\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u8bef\u8bbe\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u4f9b\u5177\u6709\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u3002"}}

Existing action-centric methods struggle with the flexibility of real procedures, where step order varies depending on object states. In this work, we propose to shift the focus to an object-centric paradigm by regarding actions as mechanisms that drive state transitions. To advance this direction, we introduce Object-IVQA, a long-form instructional video benchmark with 107 videos and 514 open-ended question-answer pairs annotated with temporally grounded evidence. The benchmark evaluates four dimensions of object-centric reasoning, including state evolution, precondition verification, counterfactual reasoning and mistake recognition. We further propose an agent framework that orchestrates object-centric planning, perception, analysis and generation tools, enabling explicit evidence retrieval and multi-hop reasoning across disjoint segments.

By analyzing the internal behaviors of the state and image token updating mechanism, we find that aggregating self-attention maps across layers reveals a consistent pattern: dynamic regions are naturally down-weighted, exposing an implicit motion cue that the pretrained transformer already encodes but never explicitly uses. Motivated by this observation, we introduce MUT3R, a training-free framework that applies the attention-derived motion cue to suppress dynamic content in the early layers of the transformer during inference. Our attention-level gating module suppresses the influence of dynamic regions before their artifacts propagate through the feature hierarchy. Notably, we do not retrain or fine-tune the model; we let the pretrained transformer diagnose its own motion cues and correct itself. This early regulation stabilizes geometric reasoning in streaming scenarios and leads to improvements in temporal consistency and camera pose robustness across multiple dynamic benchmarks, offering a simple and training-free pathway toward motion-aware streaming reconstruction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMUT3R\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3Transformer\u4e2d\u9690\u542b\u4f46\u672a\u88ab\u5229\u7528\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u6291\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u533a\u57df\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b3D\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u59ff\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u72b6\u6001\u5316\u5faa\u73af\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u9759\u60013D\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6613\u53d7\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f2a\u5f71\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u975e\u521a\u6027\u533a\u57df\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u95f4\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4f20\u64ad\uff1b\u4f5c\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\u8de8\u5c42\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u805a\u5408\u53ef\u81ea\u7136\u51f8\u663e\u52a8\u6001\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u51fa\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3Transformer\u5df2\u9690\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u4f46\u672a\u663e\u5f0f\u5229\u7528\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u7684MUT3R\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7ea7\u95e8\u63a7\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u591a\u5c42\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u805a\u5408\u751f\u6210\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u4e8eTransformer\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\u6291\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u533a\u57df\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u963b\u6b62\u5176\u4f2a\u5f71\u5411\u9ad8\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u4f20\u64ad\uff1b\u5168\u7a0b\u4e0d\u8fdb\u884c\u4efb\u4f55\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u52a8\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u59ff\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6d41\u5f0f\u91cd\u5efa\u573a\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3Transformer\u81ea\u8eab\u5df2\u8574\u542b\u53ef\u88ab\u6316\u6398\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u52a8\u6001\u5185\u5bb9\u6291\u5236\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u6d41\u5f0f3D\u91cd\u5efa\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Domain generalization (DG) solutions aim to address this issue by extracting domain-invariant representations that mitigate errors in unseen domains. However, in hydrological settings, each reservoir exhibits unique inflow patterns, while some metadata beyond observations like spatial information exerts indirect but significant influence. This mismatch limits the applicability of conventional DG techniques to many-domain hydrological systems. To overcome these challenges, we propose HydroDCM, a scalable DG framework for cross-reservoir inflow forecasting. Spatial metadata of reservoirs is used to construct pseudo-domain labels that guide adversarial learning of invariant temporal features. During inference, HydroDCM adapts these features through light-weight conditioning layers informed by the target reservoir's metadata, reconciling DG's invariance with location-specific adaptation.

However, adapting SAM to specific downstream tasks, such as medical and agricultural imaging, remains a significant challenge. To address this, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have been widely employed to enhancing SAM's adaptation performance on diverse domains. Despite advancements, a critical question arises: can we integrate inductive bias into the model? This is particularly relevant since the Transformer encoder in SAM inherently lacks spatial priors within image patches, potentially hindering the acquisition of high-level semantic information. In this paper, we propose NAS-LoRA, a new Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method designed to bridge the semantic gap between pre-trained SAM and specialized domains. Specifically, NAS-LoRA incorporates a lightweight Neural Architecture Search (NAS) block between the encoder and decoder components of LoRA to dynamically optimize the prior knowledge integrated into weight updates. Furthermore, we propose a stage-wise optimization strategy to help the ViT encoder balance weight updates and architectural adjustments, facilitating the gradual learning of high-level semantic information. Various Experiments demonstrate our NAS-LoRA improves existing PEFT methods, while reducing training cost by 24.14% without increasing inference cost, highlighting the potential of NAS in enhancing PEFT for visual foundation models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faNAS-LoRA\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\u641c\u7d22\uff08NAS\uff09\u4e0e\u4f4e\u79e9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff08LoRA\uff09\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347SAM\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u3001\u519c\u4e1a\u7b49\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5728LoRA\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u95f4\u5d4c\u5165\u8f7b\u91cfNAS\u6a21\u5757\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u9ad8\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u964d\u4f4e24.14%\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "SAM\u7684Transformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7f3a\u4e4f\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\u5185\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u83b7\u53d6\u9ad8\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u5176\u5728\u533b\u7597\u3001\u519c\u4e1a\u7b49\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u9002\u914d\u6548\u679c\uff1b\u73b0\u6709LoRA\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u63d0\u5347\u9002\u914d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u663e\u5f0f\u5f15\u5165\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNAS-LoRA\uff1a\u5728LoRA\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0e\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4e4b\u95f4\u63d2\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\u641c\u7d22\uff08NAS\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\u4e2d\u878d\u5165\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u534f\u8c03ViT\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0e\u67b6\u6784\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u4ee5\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u9ad8\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u3002", "result": "NAS-LoRA\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709PEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e24.14%\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u65e0\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06NAS\u5f15\u5165PEFT\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u8865SAM\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5148\u9a8c\u7f3a\u5931\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86NAS\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u9ad8\u6548\u9002\u914d\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

The agentic paradigm promises that VLMs can use a wide variety of tools that could augment these capabilities, such as depth estimators, segmentation models, and pose estimators. Yet it remains an open challenge how to realize this vision without solely relying on handcrafted prompting strategies or enforcing fixed, predefined tool pipelines that limit VLMs' ability to discover optimal tool-use patterns. Reinforcement Learning could overcome this gap, but has so far been limited to reasoning with a single visual tool due to the large search space in multi-tool reasoning. We introduce Double Interactive Reinforcement Learning (DIRL), a two-phase training framework where VLMs learn to coordinate multiple tools through interactive exploration and feedback. In the teaching phase, we combine demonstrations from a single tool specialist trained via interactive RL with traces from a frontier model using all tools. In the exploration phase, the model further refines multi-tool coordination through continued RL. Our model, SpaceTools, with tool-augmented spatial reasoning ability, achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial understanding benchmarks (RoboSpatial-Home, BLINK, BOP-ASK) and demonstrates reliable real-world manipulation using a 7-DOF robot as a tool. DIRL provides substantial improvements over the vanilla SFT (+12% on RoboSpatial) and RL (+16% on RoboSpatial) baselines.

A key finding is that TFMs can be pretrained entirely on synthetic datasets, opening opportunities to design data generators that encourage desirable model properties. Prior work has mainly focused on crafting high-quality priors over generators to improve overall pretraining performance. Our insight is that parameterizing the generator distribution enables an adversarial robustness perspective: during training, we can adapt the generator to emphasize datasets that are particularly challenging for the model. We formalize this by introducing an optimality gap measure, given by the difference between TFM performance and the best achievable performance as estimated by strong baselines such as XGBoost, CatBoost, and Random Forests. Building on this idea, we propose Robust Tabular Foundation Models (RTFM), a model-agnostic adversarial training framework. Applied to the TabPFN V2 classifier, RTFM improves benchmark performance, with up to a 6% increase in mean normalized AUC over the original TabPFN and other baseline algorithms, while requiring less than 100k additional synthetic datasets. These results highlight a promising new direction for targeted adversarial training and fine-tuning of TFMs using synthetic data alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u8868\u683c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08TFM\uff09\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6RTFM\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ee5\u7f29\u5c0f\u5176\u4e0e\u5f3a\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982XGBoost\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709TFM\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5bf9\u6297\u4f18\u5316\uff1b\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\uff0c\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u5668\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u540e\u53ef\u4ece\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u89c6\u89d2\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u4e3b\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u5dee\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ee5\u9a71\u52a8\u5176\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f18\u5316\u95f4\u9699\uff08optimality gap\uff09\u5ea6\u91cf\u2014\u2014\u5373TFM\u6027\u80fd\u4e0eXGBoost\u7b49\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u5dee\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6RTFM\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316TFM\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5668\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4f7f\u751f\u6210\u5668\u504f\u5411\u4ea7\u51fa\u96be\u6837\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5728TabPFN V2\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1RTFM\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u5f52\u4e00\u5316AUC\u8f83\u539f\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe6%\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u989d\u5916\u4e0d\u523010\u4e07\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5668\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9776\u5411\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4e3a\u7eaf\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684TFM\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0e\u5fae\u8c03\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Current approaches to longform video understanding either suffer from severe computational overhead due to dense preprocessing, or fail to effectively balance exploration and exploitation, resulting in incomplete information coverage and inefficiency. In this work, we introduce EEA, a novel video agent framework that archives exploration-exploitation balance through semantic guidance with hierarchical tree search process. EEA autonomously discovers and dynamically updates task-relevant semantic queries, and collects video frames closely matched to these queries as semantic anchors. During the tree search process, instead of uniform expansion, EEA preferentially explores semantically relevant frames while ensuring sufficient coverage within unknown segments. Moreover, EEA adaptively combines intrinsic rewards from visionlanguage models (VLMs) with semantic priors by explicitly modeling uncertainty to achieve stable and precise evaluation of video segments.

Traditional bias correction via data assimilation improves constrained simulations but offers limited benefit once models run freely. We introduce an operator-learning framework that maps instantaneous model states to bias-correction tendencies and applies them online during integration. Building on a U-Net backbone, we develop two operator architectures Inception U-Net (IUNet) and a multi-scale network (M\\&M) that combine diverse upsampling and receptive fields to capture multiscale nonlinear features under Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) runtime constraints. Trained on two years E3SM simulations nudged toward ERA5 reanalysis, the operators generalize across height levels and seasons. Both architectures outperform standard U-Net baselines in offline tests, indicating that functional richness rather than parameter count drives performance. In online hybrid E3SM runs, M\\&M delivers the most consistent bias reductions across variables and vertical levels. The ML-augmented configurations remain stable and computationally feasible in multi-year simulations, providing a practical pathway for scalable hybrid modeling.

Existing strategies for memory-bounded inference, such as quantization, offloading, or heuristic KV eviction, either incur high orchestration costs or rely on unreliable attention-based proxies of importance. We propose TRIM-KV, a novel approach that learns each token's intrinsic importance at creation time via a lightweight retention gate. Each gate predicts a scalar retention score that decays over time, reflecting the long-term utility of the token for a specific layer and head. Tokens with low scores are evicted when the memory budget is exceeded, ensuring that the cache always contains the most critical tokens. TRIM-KV is trained efficiently through distillation from a frozen LLM combined with a capacity loss, requiring only gate fine-tuning and adding negligible inference overhead. Across mathematical reasoning (GSM8K, MATH-500, AIME24), procedural generation (LongProc), conversational long-memory benchmarks (LongMemEval), and long-context understanding (LongBench and SCBench), TRIM-KV consistently outperforms strong eviction and learnable retrieval baselines, especially in low-memory regimes. Remarkably, it even surpasses full-cache models in some settings, showing that selective retention can serve as a form of regularization, suppressing noise from uninformative tokens. Qualitative analyses further reveal that learned retention scores align with human intuition, naturally recovering heuristics such as sink tokens, sliding windows, and gist compression without explicit design. Beyond efficiency, retention scores provide insights into layer- and head-specific roles, suggesting a new path toward LLM interpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faTRIM-KV\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728token\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u5176\u5185\u5728\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff08\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4fdd\u7559\u95e8\u9884\u6d4b\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u4fdd\u7559\u5206\uff09\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u88c1\u526aKV\u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u7a0bLLM\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u517c\u5177\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709KV\u7f13\u5b58\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u91cf\u5316\u3001\u5378\u8f7d\u3001\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u9a71\u9010\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u8c03\u5ea6\u5f00\u9500\u9ad8\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u800c\u957f\u7a0bLLM\u63a8\u7406\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u4e0d\u65ad\u589e\u957f\u7684KV\u7f13\u5b58\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTRIM-KV\uff1a\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2atoken\u5728\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4fdd\u7559\u95e8\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u5176\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u5c42/\u5934\u4e0b\u7684\u957f\u671f\u6548\u7528\u5f97\u5206\uff08\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u8870\u51cf\uff09\uff1b\u5185\u5b58\u8d85\u9650\u65f6\u6309\u5f97\u5206\u9a71\u9010\u4f4e\u5206token\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u84b8\u998f+\u5bb9\u91cf\u635f\u5931\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ec5\u5fae\u8c03\u95e8\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\uff08GSM8K\u7b49\uff09\u3001\u7a0b\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\uff08LongProc\uff09\u3001\u957f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff08LongMemEval\uff09\u53ca\u957f\u6587\u672c\u7406\u89e3\uff08LongBench\u7b49\uff09\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cTRIM-KV\u5728\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u573a\u666f\u8d85\u8d8a\u5168\u7f13\u5b58\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u4fdd\u7559\u5206\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f4\u89c9\uff0c\u9690\u5f0f\u6062\u590dsink token\u3001\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u3001\u4e3b\u65e8\u538b\u7f29\u7b49\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "TRIM-KV\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684KV\u7f13\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\uff1b\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8fd8\u8d77\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4f5c\u7528\u6291\u5236\u566a\u58f0\uff1b\u4fdd\u7559\u5206\u672c\u8eab\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5c42/\u5934\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Our approach identifies dancers within video frames, counts discrete dance steps, calculates spatial coverage patterns, and measures rhythm consistency across performance sequences. Testing this framework on a single 49-second recording of Ghanaian AfroBeats dance demonstrates technical feasibility, with the system achieving approximately 94% detection precision and 89% recall on manually inspected samples. The pixel-level segmentation provided by SAM, achieving approximately 83% intersection-over-union with visual inspection, enables motion quantification that captures body configuration changes beyond what bounding-box approaches can represent. Analysis of this preliminary case study indicates that the dancer classified as primary by our system executed 23% more steps with 37% higher motion intensity and utilized 42% more performance space compared to dancers classified as secondary. However, this work represents an early-stage investigation with substantial limitations including single-video validation, absence of systematic ground truth annotations, and lack of comparison with existing pose estimation methods.

However, their ability to interpret cartographic maps remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce CartoMapQA, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LVLMs' understanding of cartographic maps through question-answering tasks. The dataset includes over 2000 samples, each composed of a cartographic map, a question (with open-ended or multiple-choice answers), and a ground-truth answer. These tasks span key low-, mid- and high-level map interpretation skills, including symbol recognition, embedded information extraction, scale interpretation, and route-based reasoning. Our evaluation of both open-source and proprietary LVLMs reveals persistent challenges: models frequently struggle with map-specific semantics, exhibit limited geospatial reasoning, and are prone to Optical Character Recognition (OCR)-related errors. By isolating these weaknesses, CartoMapQA offers a valuable tool for guiding future improvements in LVLM architectures. Ultimately, it supports the development of models better equipped for real-world applications that depend on robust and reliable map understanding, such as navigation, geographic search, and urban planning.

We propose SAFLe, a framework that achieves scalable non-linear expressivity by introducing a structured head of bucketed features and sparse, grouped embeddings. We prove this non-linear architecture is mathematically equivalent to a high-dimensional linear regression. This key equivalence allows SAFLe to be solved with AFL's single-shot, invariant aggregation law.

This finding has sparked excitement about vision-based context compression for language models.

We test two assumptions implicit in the optical-compression narrative: that vision-based compression provides unique advantages for text reconstruction from compressed representations, and that DeepSeek-OCR's reconstruction results are evidence that vision-based compression will be useful for language modeling. Comparing their vision encoder against simple alternatives--parameter-free mean pooling and a learned hierarchical encoder--we find that these simple approaches match or surpass vision for reconstruction at matched compression ratios, and outperform it for language modeling--where vision-based compression fails to beat truncation.

This motivates the use of Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE) for rapid, offline assessment. However, applying OPE to ad auctions is fundamentally more challenging than in domains like recommender systems, where stochastic policies are common. In online ad auctions, it is common for the highest-bidding ad to win the impression, resulting in a deterministic, winner-takes-all setting. This results in zero probability of exposure for non-winning ads, rendering standard OPE estimators inapplicable. We introduce the first principled framework for OPE in deterministic auctions by repurposing the bid landscape model to approximate the propensity score. This model allows us to derive robust approximate propensity scores, enabling the use of stable estimators like Self-Normalized Inverse Propensity Scoring (SNIPS) for counterfactual evaluation. We validate our approach on the AuctionNet simulation benchmark and against 2-weeks online A/B test from a large-scale industrial platform. Our method shows remarkable alignment with online results, achieving a 92\\% Mean Directional Accuracy (MDA) in CTR prediction, significantly outperforming the parametric baseline. MDA is the most critical metric for guiding deployment decisions, as it reflects the ability to correctly predict whether a new model will improve or harm performance.

Given time-varying text prompts, FloodDiffusion generates text-aligned, seamless motion sequences with real-time latency. Unlike existing methods that rely on chunk-by-chunk or auto-regressive model with diffusion head, we adopt a diffusion forcing framework to model this time-series generation task under time-varying control events. We find that a straightforward implementation of vanilla diffusion forcing (as proposed for video models) fails to model real motion distributions. We demonstrate that to guarantee modeling the output distribution, the vanilla diffusion forcing must be tailored to: (i) train with a bi-directional attention instead of casual attention; (ii) implement a lower triangular time scheduler instead of a random one; (iii) utilize a continues time-varying way to introduce text conditioning. With these improvements, we demonstrate in the first time that the diffusion forcing-based framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the streaming motion generation task, reaching an FID of 0.057 on the HumanML3D benchmark.

In this work, we first reveal a critical and previously overlooked weakness: even state-of-the-art MLLMs are surprisingly brittle, showing significant performance degradation on images with simple orientation changes or natural corruptions, underscoring the need for more robust tool-based reasoning. To address this, we propose CodeVision, a flexible and scalable code-as-tool framework where the model generates code as a universal interface to invoke any image operation, moving beyond fixed tool registries. We train our model using a two-stage methodology, beginning with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on a high-quality dataset curated for complex, multi-turn tool composition and error recovery, followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a novel and dense process reward function to encourage strategic and efficient tool use. To facilitate this research, we construct new SFT and RL datasets and introduce a challenging new benchmark suite designed to rigorously evaluate robustness to orientation changes and multi-tool reasoning. Experiments on Qwen2.5-VL and Qwen3-VL series show that our approach significantly improves model performance and fosters emergent capabilities such as flexible tool composition, efficient chained execution, and robust error recovery from runtime feedback.

Classical aggregation rules assume euclidean topology and uniform communication reliability, limiting their suitability for emerging quantum federated systems. This paper introduces A2G (Adaptive Aggregation with Two Gains), a dual gain framework that jointly regulates geometric blending through a geometry gain and modulates client importance using a QoS gain derived from teleportation fidelity, latency, and instability. We develop the A2G update rule, establish convergence guarantees under smoothness and bounded variance assumptions, and show that A2G recovers FedAvg, QoS aware averaging, and manifold based aggregation as special cases. Experiments on a quantum classical hybrid testbed demonstrate improved stability and higher accuracy under heterogeneous and noisy conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faA2G\uff08\u53cc\u589e\u76ca\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u805a\u5408\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u589e\u76ca\u548cQoS\u589e\u76ca\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u6df7\u5408\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5f02\u6784\u4e0e\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u805a\u5408\u89c4\u5219\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b27\u6c0f\u62d3\u6251\u548c\u5747\u5300\u901a\u4fe1\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u914d\u91cf\u5b50\u4f7f\u80fd\u3001\u8bbe\u5907\u5f02\u6784\u3001\u4fe1\u9053\u968f\u673a\uff08\u5982\u91cf\u5b50\u9690\u5f62\u4f20\u6001\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6ce2\u52a8\uff09\u3001\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ca\u5c40\u90e8-\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u51e0\u4f55\u5931\u914d\u7b49\u73b0\u5b9e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faA2G\u53cc\u589e\u76ca\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u51e0\u4f55\u589e\u76ca\u8c03\u63a7\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u878d\u5408\uff0cQoS\u589e\u76ca\u4f9d\u636e\u9690\u5f62\u4f20\u6001\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u65f6\u5ef6\u548c\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff1b\u63a8\u5bfcA2G\u66f4\u65b0\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u548c\u6709\u754c\u65b9\u5dee\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u8bc1\u660e\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660eA2G\u53ef\u9000\u5316\u4e3aFedAvg\u3001QoS\u611f\u77e5\u5e73\u5747\u53ca\u6d41\u5f62\u805a\u5408\u7b49\u7279\u4f8b\uff1b\u5728\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u6df7\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u4e0e\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "A2G\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u517c\u987e\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u805a\u5408\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0e\u8bbe\u5907\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

We attribute this to two key limitations of existing methods: (1) proposal generation relies on dataset-specific proposal networks or mesh-based superpoints, rendering them inapplicable in mesh-free scenarios and limiting generalization to novel scenes; and (2) the weak textual reasoning of CLIP-based classifiers, which struggle to recognize compositional and functional user queries. To address these issues, we introduce OpenTrack3D, a generalizable and accurate framework. Unlike methods that rely on pre-generated proposals, OpenTrack3D employs a novel visual-spatial tracker to construct cross-view consistent object proposals online. Given an RGB-D stream, our pipeline first leverages a 2D open-vocabulary segmenter to generate masks, which are lifted to 3D point clouds using depth. Mask-guided instance features are then extracted using DINO feature maps, and our tracker fuses visual and spatial cues to maintain instance consistency. The core pipeline is entirely mesh-free, yet we also provide an optional superpoints refinement module to further enhance performance when scene mesh is available. Finally, we replace CLIP with a multi-modal large language model (MLLM), significantly enhancing compositional reasoning for complex user queries.

While existing efficient VLM approaches reduce visual tokens through fixed-ratio compression, they operate passively and lack the ability to adapt to varying task requirements. This motivates a fundamental question: Can VLMs autonomously determine the minimum number of visual tokens required for each sample? Inspired by human active vision mechanisms, we introduce AdaptVision, an efficient VLM paradigm that enables adaptive visual token acquisition through a coarse-to-fine approach. Our model initially processes compressed visual tokens from low-resolution images and selectively acquires additional visual information by invoking a bounding box tool to crop key regions when necessary. We train AdaptVision using a reinforcement learning framework that carefully balances accuracy and efficiency. Central to our approach is Decoupled Turn Policy Optimization (DTPO), which decouples the learning objective into two components: (1) tool learning, which optimizes correct tool utilization, and (2) accuracy improvement, which refines the generated responses to improve answer correctness. Based on this formulation, we further decouple advantage estimation by computing separate advantages for tokens associated with each objective. This formulation enables more effective optimization for AdaptVision compared to vanilla GRPO. Comprehensive experiments across multiple VQA benchmarks demonstrate that AdaptVision achieves superior performance while consuming substantially fewer visual tokens than state-of-the-art efficient VLM methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAdaptVision\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e3b\u52a8\u89c6\u89c9\u673a\u5236\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u83b7\u53d6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9ad8\u6548\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u6bd4\u4f8b\u538b\u7f29\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u81ea\u4e3b\u51b3\u5b9a\u6bcf\u6837\u672c\u6240\u9700\u6700\u5c11\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAdaptVision\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u521d\u59cb\u5904\u7406\u4e0e\u6309\u9700\u8c03\u7528\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u5de5\u5177\u88c1\u526a\u5173\u952e\u533a\u57df\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89e3\u8026\u56de\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08DTPO\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u522b\u4f30\u8ba1\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aVQA\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAdaptVision\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u9ad8\u6548VLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "conclusion": "AdaptVision\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

To handle this, prior approaches mainly scale the visual generation process (e.g., increasing sampling steps or seeds), but this quickly leads to a quality plateau. This limitation arises because the prompt, crucial for guiding generation, is kept fixed. To address this, we propose Prompt Redesign for Inference-time Scaling, coined PRIS, a framework that adaptively revises the prompt during inference in response to the scaled visual generations. The core idea of PRIS is to review the generated visuals, identify recurring failure patterns across visuals, and redesign the prompt accordingly before regenerating the visuals with the revised prompt. To provide precise alignment feedback for prompt revision, we introduce a new verifier, element-level factual correction, which evaluates the alignment between prompt attributes and generated visuals at a fine-grained level, achieving more accurate and interpretable assessments than holistic measures.

Most previous works focused on the Text2Gloss, Gloss2Pose, Pose2Vid stages, and some concentrated on Prompt2Gloss and Text2Avatar stages.

Therefore, in this paper, we streamline the traditional redundant structure, simplify and optimize the task objective, and design a new sign language generative model called Stable Signer. It redefines the SLP task as a hierarchical generation end-to-end task that only includes text understanding (Prompt2Gloss, Text2Gloss) and Pose2Vid, and executes text understanding through our proposed new Sign Language Understanding Linker called SLUL, and generates hand gestures through the named SLP-MoE hand gesture rendering expert block to end-to-end generate high-quality and multi-style sign language videos.

We introduce UniQL, a unified post-training quantization and low-rank compression framework with on-device configurable pruning rates for edge LLMs. UniQL is a general framework that integrates quantization and low-rank compression for Transformers, State Space Models (SSMs), and hybrid models to support diverse edge applications. In our proposed joint framework, we introduce an efficient structured weight-sorting method that speeds up computation by 20x, quantization-aware singular value decomposition (SVD) to minimize quantization errors, state-aware weight sorting for SSMs, and a fused rotary positional embedding (RoPE) kernel for pruned models. Our framework performs weight-sorting, fine-tuning, and quantization in the cloud in a single-pass workflow, while enabling on-device configurable pruning rates up to 35%. Our experiments show that quantized and pruned models achieve a memory reduction of 4x-5.7x and a token-throughput improvement of 2.7x-3.4x, maintaining accuracy within 5% of the original models at 15% pruning across Transformers (Llama3 and Qwen2.5), SSMs (Mamba2), and hybrid models (Nemotron-H and Bamba-v2).

While recent diffusion models have shown strong capabilities in text-to-image generation, they struggle to handle structured multi-step scenarios like recipe illustration. Additionally, current recipe illustration methods are unable to adjust to the natural variability in recipe length, generating a fixed number of images regardless of the actual instructions structure. To address these limitations, we present CookAnything, a flexible and consistent diffusion-based framework that generates coherent, semantically distinct image sequences from textual cooking instructions of arbitrary length. The framework introduces three key components: (1) Step-wise Regional Control (SRC), which aligns textual steps with corresponding image regions within a single denoising process; (2) Flexible RoPE, a step-aware positional encoding mechanism that enhances both temporal coherence and spatial diversity; and (3) Cross-Step Consistency Control (CSCC), which maintains fine-grained ingredient consistency across steps. Experimental results on recipe illustration benchmarks show that CookAnything performs better than existing methods in training-based and training-free settings.

We introduce a novel tuning-free framework that leverages Implicit Regularization (IR) from overparameterization to overcome this limitation. Our approach reparameterizes the estimation matrix into factors that decouple the shared row-support from individual vector entries. We show that the optimization dynamics inherently promote the desired row-sparse structure by applying gradient descent to a standard least-squares objective on these factors. We prove that with a sufficiently small and balanced initialization, the optimization dynamics exhibit a \"momentum-like\" effect, causing the norms of rows in the true support to grow significantly faster than others. This formally guarantees that the solution trajectory converges towards an idealized row-sparse solution.

This issue stems from a fundamental problem of visual neglect, where models fail to adequately prioritize input images. Existing methods typically alleviate hallucinations by intervening in the attention score or output logits, focusing on \"how to intervene\" but overlooking the prerequisite \"when to intervene\", which leads to the \"over-intervention\" problem and subsequently introduces new hallucinations and unnecessary computational overhead. To address this gap, we first investigate the mechanism of visual neglect and reveal it can be accurately detected via head-level activation patterns in MLLMs. We thus propose V-ITI, a lightweight visual inference-time intervention framework integrating a Visual Neglect Detector that identifies visual neglect via head-level discriminative probes and a Visual Recall Intervenor that modulates activations with prestored visual activation information only when the visual neglect is detected.

While graph neural networks (GNNs) achieve strong performance by learning expressive representations via message passing, they incur high computational costs, limiting their scalability and deployment on resource-constrained devices. Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), also known as Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSA), offers a lightweight, brain-inspired alternative, yet existing HDC-based graph methods typically struggle to match the predictive performance of GNNs. In this work, we propose VS-Graph, a vector-symbolic graph learning framework that narrows the gap between the efficiency of HDC and the expressive power of message passing. VS-Graph introduces a Spike Diffusion mechanism for topology-driven node identification and an Associative Message Passing scheme for multi-hop neighborhood aggregation entirely within the high-dimensional vector space. Without gradient-based optimization or backpropagation, our method achieves competitive accuracy with modern GNNs, outperforming the prior HDC baseline by 4-5% on standard benchmarks such as MUTAG and DD.

We present a hybrid moderation framework deployed at production scale that combines supervised classification for known violations with reference-based similarity matching for novel or subtle cases. This hybrid design enables robust detection of both explicit violations and novel edge cases that evade traditional classifiers. Multimodal inputs (text, audio, visual) are processed through both pipelines, with a multimodal large language model (MLLM) distilling knowledge into each to boost accuracy while keeping inference lightweight. In production, the classification pipeline achieves 67% recall at 80% precision, and the similarity pipeline achieves 76% recall at 80% precision. Large-scale A/B tests show a 6-8% reduction in user views of unwanted livestreams}.

Even an AI system that is perfectly aligned to the intentions of its operating organization can lead to bad outcomes if the goals of that organization are misaligned with those of other institutions and individuals. For this reason, we need full-stack alignment, the concurrent alignment of AI systems and the institutions that shape them with what people value. This can be done without imposing a particular vision of individual or collective flourishing. We argue that current approaches for representing values, such as utility functions, preference orderings, or unstructured text, struggle to address these and other issues effectively. They struggle to distinguish values from other signals, to support principled normative reasoning, and to model collective goods. We propose thick models of value will be needed. These structure the way values and norms are represented, enabling systems to distinguish enduring values from fleeting preferences, to model the social embedding of individual choices, and to reason normatively, applying values in new domains. We demonstrate this approach in five areas: AI value stewardship, normatively competent agents, win-win negotiation systems, meaning-preserving economic mechanisms, and democratic regulatory institutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u201c\u5168\u6808\u5bf9\u9f50\u201d\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9700\u5bf9\u9f50AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u5176\u64cd\u4f5c\u8005\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u8fd8\u9700\u540c\u6b65\u5bf9\u9f50\u5851\u9020AI\u7684\u5236\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6240\u73cd\u89c6\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\uff1b\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u4ef7\u503c\u8868\u5f81\u65b9\u5f0f\uff08\u5982\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u3001\u504f\u597d\u6392\u5e8f\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4e3b\u5f20\u91c7\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u201c\u539a\u4ef7\u503c\u6a21\u578b\u201d\uff0c\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u6301\u4e45\u4ef7\u503c\u4e0e\u4e34\u65f6\u504f\u597d\u3001\u5efa\u6a21\u793e\u4f1a\u8bed\u5883\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709AI\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u4e2a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u64cd\u4f5c\u8005\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u7ec4\u7ec7\u76ee\u6807\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u673a\u6784\u53ca\u4e2a\u4f53\u4ef7\u503c\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u969c\u6709\u76ca\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u7ed3\u679c\uff1b\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ca\u5176\u5236\u5ea6\u73af\u5883\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u201c\u539a\u4ef7\u503c\u6a21\u578b\u201d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65b0\u578b\u4ef7\u503c\u8868\u5f81\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\uff1a\u533a\u5206\u6301\u4e45\u4ef7\u503c\u4e0e\u77ed\u6682\u504f\u597d\u3001\u5d4c\u5165\u793e\u4f1a\u8bed\u5883\u3001\u652f\u6301\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u63a8\u7406\uff1b\u5e76\u5728AI\u4ef7\u503c\u6cbb\u7406\u3001\u89c4\u8303\u80dc\u4efb\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3001\u5171\u8d62\u8c08\u5224\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u610f\u4e49\u4fdd\u6301\u578b\u7ecf\u6d4e\u673a\u5236\u548c\u6c11\u4e3b\u76d1\u7ba1\u5236\u5ea6\u4e94\u4e2a\u65b9\u5411\u5f00\u5c55\u6982\u5ff5\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u8bc1\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u4ef7\u503c\u8868\u5f81\uff08\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u3001\u504f\u597d\u6392\u5e8f\u3001\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u672c\uff09\u5728\u533a\u5206\u4ef7\u503c\u4fe1\u53f7\u3001\u652f\u6491\u89c4\u8303\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5efa\u6a21\u96c6\u4f53\u5584\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6839\u672c\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b\u786e\u7acb\u539a\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u6808\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u8bba\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u6b63\u6709\u76ca\u7684AI\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u63a8\u8fdb\u5168\u6808\u5bf9\u9f50\u2014\u2014\u5373AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u5236\u5ea6\u53cc\u91cd\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\uff1b\u539a\u4ef7\u503c\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u514b\u670d\u5f53\u524d\u8868\u5f81\u5c40\u9650\u3001\u652f\u6491\u8be5\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5173\u952e\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u3002"}}

We use a controlled 2x2x2 Rubik's Cube and ask: (1) how does explicitly pretraining a world model affect the model's latent representations, and (2) how does world-model quality affect the model's performance after reinforcement learning post-training? We compare standard next-token prediction to two explicit world-modeling strategies -- (i) state-prediction pretraining and (ii) a joint state-prediction + next-token objective -- and assess task performance after Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is applied as post-training. We evaluate the representation quality with linear probes and causal interventions. We find that explicit world-modeling yields more linearly decodable and causally steerable state representations. More importantly, we find that improved state representations lead to higher gains for GRPO, especially on harder cube states.

We ask whether this training regime also helps with machine unlearning, i.e., removing the influence of specified data without full retraining. We compare applying standard unlearning methods before versus after the grokking transition across vision (CNNs/ResNets on CIFAR, SVHN, and ImageNet) and language (a transformer on a TOFU-style setup). Starting from grokked checkpoints consistently yields (i) more efficient forgetting (fewer updates to reach a target forget level), (ii) less collateral damage (smaller drops on retained and test performance), and (iii) more stable updates across seeds, relative to early-stopped counterparts under identical unlearning algorithms. Analyses of features and curvature further suggest that post-grokking models learn more modular representations with reduced gradient alignment between forget and retain subsets, which facilitates selective forgetting.

To achieve this, we introduce the notion of information uniqueness to measure intrinsic redundancy among tokens to link with reconstruction error.

However, existing methods often struggle to effectively integrate diverse opinion modalities and capture fine-grained interactions across them. This paper proposes an end-to-end deep learning framework that integrates two distinct modalities of financial opinions: recency modality (timely opinions) and popularity modality (trending opinions), through a novel cross-modal attention mechanism specifically designed for financial sentiment analysis. While both modalities consist of textual data, they represent fundamentally different information channels: recency-driven market updates versus popularity-driven collective sentiment. Our model first uses BERT (Chinese-wwm-ext) for feature embedding and then employs our proposed Financial Multi-Head Cross-Attention (FMHCA) structure to facilitate information exchange between these distinct opinion modalities. The processed features are optimized through a transformer layer and fused using multimodal factored bilinear pooling for classification into negative, neutral, and positive sentiment. Extensive experiments on a comprehensive dataset covering 837 companies demonstrate that our approach achieves an accuracy of 83.5%, significantly outperforming baselines including BERT+Transformer by 21 percent.

Camera-ready version accepted for IEEE BIBM 2025", "summary": "Universal, transferable whole-slide image (WSI) representations are central to computational pathology. Incorporating multiple markers (e.g., immunohistochemistry, IHC) alongside H&E enriches H&E-based features with diverse, biologically meaningful information. However, progress is limited by the scarcity of well-aligned multi-stain datasets. Inter-stain misalignment shifts corresponding tissue across slides, hindering consistent patch-level features and degrading slide-level embeddings. To address this, we curated a slide-level aligned, five-stain dataset (H&E, HER2, KI67, ER, PGR) to enable paired H&E-IHC learning and robust cross-stain representation. Leveraging this dataset, we propose Cross-Stain Contrastive Learning (CSCL), a two-stage pretraining framework with a lightweight adapter trained using patch-wise contrastive alignment to improve the compatibility of H&E features with corresponding IHC-derived contextual cues, and slide-level representation learning with Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), which uses a cross-stain attention fusion module to integrate stain-specific patch features and a cross-stain global alignment module to enforce consistency among slide-level embeddings across different stains. Experiments on cancer subtype classification, IHC biomarker status classification, and survival prediction show consistent gains, yielding high-quality, transferable H&E slide-level representations.

Rather than randomly varying, there are typically a small number of subtypes for how a disease progresses across patients. To capture this structured heterogeneity, the Subtype and Stage Inference Event-Based Model (SuStaIn) estimates the number of subtypes, the order of disease progression for each subtype, and assigns each patient to a subtype from primarily cross-sectional data. It has been widely applied to uncover the subtypes of many diseases and inform our understanding of them. But how robust is its performance? In this paper, we develop a principled Bayesian subtype variant of the event-based model (BEBMS) and compare its performance to SuStaIn in a variety of synthetic data experiments with varied levels of model misspecification. BEBMS substantially outperforms SuStaIn across ordering, staging, and subtype assignment tasks. Further, we apply BEBMS and SuStaIn to a real-world Alzheimer's data set. We find BEBMS has results that are more consistent with the scientific consensus of Alzheimer's disease progression than SuStaIn.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5b50\u7c7b\u578b\u53d8\u4f53\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6a21\u578b\uff08BEBMS\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709SuStaIn\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u6392\u5e8f\u3001\u5206\u671f\u548c\u4e9a\u578b\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u9762\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u7b26\u5408\u79d1\u5b66\u5171\u8bc6\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30SuStaIn\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u75be\u75c5\u4e9a\u578b\u63a8\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u5176\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u8bef\u8bbe\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5b50\u7c7b\u578b\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6a21\u578b\uff08BEBMS\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08\u542b\u4e0d\u540c\u8bef\u8bbe\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff09\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u5176\u4e0eSuStaIn\u5728\u4e9a\u578b\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u3001\u8fdb\u5c55\u987a\u5e8f\u63a8\u65ad\u3001\u60a3\u8005\u5206\u671f\u53ca\u4e9a\u578b\u5206\u914d\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "BEBMS\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u6392\u5e8f\u3001\u5206\u671f\u3001\u4e9a\u578b\u5206\u914d\uff09\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eSuStaIn\uff1b\u5728\u771f\u5b9eAD\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\uff0cBEBMS\u7ed3\u679c\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u5171\u8bc6\u3002", "conclusion": "BEBMS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u75be\u75c5\u4e9a\u578b\u4e0e\u8fdb\u5c55\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Submitted to the IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics", "summary": "The global rise in type 2 diabetes underscores the need for scalable and cost-effective screening methods. Current diagnosis requires biochemical assays, which are invasive and costly. Advances in consumer wearables have enabled early explorations of machine learning-based disease detection, but prior studies were limited to controlled settings. We present SweetDeep, a compact neural network trained on physiological and demographic data from 285 (diabetic and non-diabetic) participants in the EU and MENA regions, collected using Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 devices in free-living conditions over six days. Each participant contributed multiple 2-minute sensor recordings per day, totaling approximately 20 recordings per individual. Despite comprising fewer than 3,000 parameters, SweetDeep achieves 82.5% patient-level accuracy (82.1% macro-F1, 79.7% sensitivity, 84.6% specificity) under three-fold cross-validation, with an expected calibration error of 5.5%. Allowing the model to abstain on less than 10% of low-confidence patient predictions yields an accuracy of 84.5% on the remaining patients.

Although recent diffusion-based approaches improve upon traditional optical-flow-based methods, they still struggle to cover diverse application scenarios and often fail to produce sharp, temporally consistent frames in fine-grained motion tasks such as audio-visual synchronized interpolation. To address these limitations, we introduce BBF (Beyond Boundary Frames), a context-aware video frame interpolation framework, which could be guided by audio/visual semantics. First, we enhance the input design of the interpolation model so that it can flexibly handle multiple conditional modalities, including text, audio, images, and video. Second, we propose a decoupled multimodal fusion mechanism that sequentially injects different conditional signals into a DiT backbone. Finally, to maintain the generation abilities of the foundation model, we adopt a progressive multi-stage training paradigm, where the start-end frame difference embedding is used to dynamically adjust both the data sampling and the loss weighting. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that BBF outperforms specialized state-of-the-art methods on both generic interpolation and audio-visual synchronized interpolation tasks, establishing a unified framework for video frame interpolation under coordinated multi-channel conditioning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faBBF\uff08Beyond Boundary Frames\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u63d2\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5149\u6d41\u6cd5\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u540c\u6b65\u63d2\u503c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u63d2\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u590d\u6742\u3001\u9ad8\u5ea6\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8fd0\u52a8\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u540c\u6b65\u7b49\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8fd0\u52a8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u6e05\u6670\u4e14\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5e27\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u589e\u5f3a\u8f93\u5165\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u6587\u672c\u3001\u97f3\u9891\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u6a21\u6001\uff1b2\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u89e3\u8026\u5f0f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4fe1\u53f7\u987a\u5e8f\u6ce8\u5165DiT\u4e3b\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff1b3\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9996\u5c3e\u5e27\u5dee\u5f02\u5d4c\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u6837\u4e0e\u635f\u5931\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "result": "BBF\u5728\u901a\u7528\u63d2\u503c\u548c\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u540c\u6b65\u63d2\u503c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f53\u524d\u4e13\u7528SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u652f\u6301\u591a\u901a\u9053\u534f\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u9891\u63d2\u503c\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "BBF\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u63d2\u503c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u8fd0\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u540c\u6b65\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In contrast, mixed pathologies are common in neurodegeneration. We introduce the Joint Progression Model (JPM), a probabilistic framework that treats single-disease trajectories as partial rankings and builds a prior over joint progressions. We study several JPM variants (Pairwise, Bradley-Terry, Plackett-Luce, and Mallows) and analyze three properties: (i) calibration -- whether lower model energy predicts smaller distance to the ground truth ordering; (ii) separation -- the degree to which sampled rankings are distinguishable from random permutations; and (iii) sharpness -- the stability of sampled aggregate rankings. All variants are calibrated, and all achieve near-perfect separation; sharpness varies by variant and is well-predicted by simple features of the input partial rankings (number and length of rankings, conflict, and overlap). In synthetic experiments, JPM improves ordering accuracy by roughly 21 percent over a strong EBM baseline (SA-EBM) that treats the joint disease as a single condition. Finally, using NACC, we find that the Mallows variant of JPM and the baseline model (SA-EBM) have results that are more consistent with prior literature on the possible disease progression of the mixed pathology of AD and VaD.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8054\u5408\u8fdb\u5c55\u6a21\u578b\uff08JPM\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u5efa\u6a21\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u4e2d\u591a\u79cd\u75c5\u7406\u5171\u5b58\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u578b\u6982\u7387\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5355\u75c5\u7a0b\u89c6\u4e3a\u504f\u5e8f\u5173\u7cfb\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u8054\u5408\u8fdb\u5c55\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\uff08NACC\uff09\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u6392\u5e8f\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u4e8b\u4ef6\u578b\u6a21\u578b\uff08EBMs\uff09\u5047\u8bbe\u4e2a\u4f53\u4ec5\u60a3\u4e00\u79cd\u75be\u75c5\uff0c\u4f46\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u4e2d\u6df7\u5408\u75c5\u7406\uff08\u5982AD\u4e0eVaD\u5171\u5b58\uff09\u5341\u5206\u5e38\u89c1\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u80fd\u5efa\u6a21\u591a\u75c5\u7a0b\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8054\u5408\u8fdb\u5c55\u6a21\u578b\uff08JPM\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u5355\u75c5\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u504f\u5e8f\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u8054\u5408\u8fdb\u5c55\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\uff1b\u7814\u7a76\u56db\u79cd\u53d8\u4f53\uff08Pairwise\u3001Bradley-Terry\u3001Plackett-Luce\u3001Mallows\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u6027\u3001\u5c16\u9510\u6027\u4e09\u65b9\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u548cNACC\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u4e0eSA-EBM\u57fa\u7ebf\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709JPM\u53d8\u4f53\u5747\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u4e0e\u8fd1\u5b8c\u7f8e\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u6027\uff1b\u5c16\u9510\u6027\u56e0\u53d8\u4f53\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u7531\u8f93\u5165\u504f\u5e8f\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u6570\u91cf\u3001\u957f\u5ea6\u3001\u51b2\u7a81\u3001\u91cd\u53e0\uff09\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\u5728\u5408\u6210\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u6392\u5e8f\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8f83SA-EBM\u63d0\u5347\u7ea621%\uff1b\u5728NACC\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\uff0cMallows-JPM\u4e0eSA-EBM\u7ed3\u679c\u66f4\u7b26\u5408AD-VaD\u6df7\u5408\u75c5\u7406\u7684\u5df2\u6709\u6587\u732e\u8ba4\u77e5\u3002", "conclusion": "JPM\u4e3a\u5efa\u6a21\u6df7\u5408\u75c5\u7406\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6982\u7387\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176Mallows\u53d8\u4f53\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002"}}

The inherent complexity of this task stems from the intricate relationship between sequence and structure, making it particularly challenging. In this paper, we propose a framework, named HyperRNA, a generative model with an encoder-decoder architecture that leverages hypergraphs to design RNA sequences. Specifically, our HyperRNA model consists of three main components: preprocessing, encoding and decoding.\n  In the preprocessing stage, graph structures are constructed by extracting the atom coordinates of RNA backbone based on 3-bead coarse-grained representation. The encoding stage processes these graphs, capturing higher order dependencies and complex biomolecular interactions using an attention embedding module and a hypergraph-based encoder.

While Vision Transformers that leverage shifted window-based self-attention have established new benchmarks in this field, they are often hampered by a critical limitation: their localized attention mechanism struggles to effectively fuse local details with global context. This deficiency is particularly detrimental to challenging tasks such as the segmentation of microtumors and miniature organs, where both fine-grained boundary definition and broad contextual understanding are paramount. To address this gap, we propose HBFormer, a novel Hybrid-Bridge Transformer architecture. The 'Hybrid' design of HBFormer synergizes a classic U-shaped encoder-decoder framework with a powerful Swin Transformer backbone for robust hierarchical feature extraction. The core innovation lies in its 'Bridge' mechanism, a sophisticated nexus for multi-scale feature integration. This bridge is architecturally embodied by our novel Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MFF) decoder. Departing from conventional symmetric designs, the MFF decoder is engineered to fuse multi-scale features from the encoder with global contextual information. It achieves this through a synergistic combination of channel and spatial attention modules, which are constructed from a series of dilated and depth-wise convolutions. These components work in concert to create a powerful feature bridge that explicitly captures long-range dependencies and refines object boundaries with exceptional precision. Comprehensive experiments on challenging medical image segmentation datasets, including multi-organ, liver tumor, and bladder tumor benchmarks, demonstrate that HBFormer achieves state-of-the-art results, showcasing its outstanding capabilities in microtumor and miniature organ segmentation.

This work presents PhyDNN, a physics-driven deep reconstruction framework that embeds the EIT forward model directly into the learning objective. By jointly minimizing the discrepancy between predicted and ground-truth conductivity maps and enforcing consistency with the forward PDE, PhyDNN reduces the black-box nature of deep networks and improves both physical plausibility and generalization. To enable efficient backpropagation, we design a differentiable forward-operator network that accurately approximates the nonlinear EIT response, allowing fast physics-guided training. Extensive simulations and real tactile experiments on a 16-electrode soft sensor show that PhyDNN consistently outperforms NOSER, TV, and standard DNNs in reconstructing contact shape, location, and pressure distribution. PhyDNN yields fewer artifacts, sharper boundaries, and higher metric scores, demonstrating its effectiveness for high-quality tomographic tactile sensing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aPhyDNN\u7684\u7269\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u6df1\u5ea6\u91cd\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u7535\u5b66\u963b\u6297\u65ad\u5c42\u6210\u50cf\uff08EIT\uff09\u5728\u5927\u9762\u79ef\u89e6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u4e2d\u56e0\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\u4e25\u91cd\u548c\u63a5\u89e6\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06EIT\u524d\u5411\u6a21\u578b\u5d4c\u5165\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u524d\u5411\u7b97\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "EIT\u5728\u5927\u9762\u79ef\u89e6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5e03\u7ebf\u5c11\u3001\u5f62\u72b6\u7075\u6d3b\u7b49\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u4f2a\u5f71\u548c\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPhyDNN\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06EIT\u524d\u5411\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u76f4\u63a5\u5d4c\u5165\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u524d\u5411\u7b97\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\uff1b\u8054\u5408\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u771f\u503c\u7535\u5bfc\u7387\u56fe\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u53ca\u524d\u5411PDE\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u572816\u7535\u6781\u67d4\u6027\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u89e6\u89c9\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cPhyDNN\u5728\u63a5\u89e6\u5f62\u72b6\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u538b\u529b\u5206\u5e03\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8eNOSER\u3001TV\u548c\u6807\u51c6DNN\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5c11\u4f2a\u5f71\u3001\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6307\u6807\u5f97\u5206\u3002", "conclusion": "PhyDNN\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86EIT\u89e6\u89c9\u6210\u50cf\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u65ad\u5c42\u89e6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We propose a retrieval-augmented framework for tooth completion that integrates a prototype memory into standard encoder--decoder pipelines. After encoding a partial input into a global descriptor, the model retrieves the nearest manifold prototype from a learnable memory and fuses it with the query feature through confidence-gated weighting before decoding. The memory is optimized end-to-end and self-organizes into reusable tooth-shape prototypes without requiring tooth-position labels, thereby providing structural priors that stabilize missing-region inference and free decoder capacity for detail recovery. The module is plug-and-play and compatible with common completion backbones, while keeping the same training losses. Experiments on a self-processed Teeth3DS benchmark demonstrate consistent improvements in Chamfer Distance, with visualizations showing sharper cusps, ridges, and interproximal transitions.

However, despite their strong generalization capabilities, these models often lack 3D consistency, a fundamental requirement for understanding scene geometry and motion, thereby causing severe spatial misalignment and temporal flickering in complex 3D environments. In this paper, we present Motion4D, a novel framework that addresses these challenges by integrating 2D priors from foundation models into a unified 4D Gaussian Splatting representation. Our method features a two-part iterative optimization framework: 1) Sequential optimization, which updates motion and semantic fields in consecutive stages to maintain local consistency, and 2) Global optimization, which jointly refines all attributes for long-term coherence. To enhance motion accuracy, we introduce a 3D confidence map that dynamically adjusts the motion priors, and an adaptive resampling process that inserts new Gaussians into under-represented regions based on per-pixel RGB and semantic errors. Furthermore, we enhance semantic coherence through an iterative refinement process that resolves semantic inconsistencies by alternately optimizing the semantic fields and updating prompts of SAM2. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our Motion4D significantly outperforms both 2D foundation models and existing 3D-based approaches across diverse scene understanding tasks, including point-based tracking, video object segmentation, and novel view synthesis.

In this paper, we propose a plugin extension paradigm termed the Deployment of extra LoRA Components (DLC) for non-pre-trained CIL scenarios.We treat the feature extractor trained through replay or distillation as a base model with rich knowledge. For each task, we use Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to inject task-specific residuals into the base model's deep layers. During inference, representations with task-specific residuals are aggregated to produce classification predictions. To mitigate interference from non-target LoRA plugins, we introduce a lightweight weighting unit. This unit learns to assign importance scores to different LoRA-tuned representations. Like downloadable contents in software, our method serves as a plug-and-play enhancement that efficiently extends the base methods. Remarkably, on the large-scale ImageNet-100, with merely 4 % of the parameters of a standard ResNet-18, our DLC model achieves a significant 8 % improvement in accuracy, demonstrating exceptional efficiency.

We introduce LAMP that leverages large language models (LLMs) as motion planners to translate natural language descriptions into explicit 3D trajectories for dynamic objects and (relatively defined) cameras. LAMP defines a motion domain-specific language (DSL), inspired by cinematography conventions. By harnessing program synthesis capabilities of LLMs, LAMP generates structured motion programs from natural language, which are deterministically mapped to 3D trajectories. We construct a large-scale procedural dataset pairing natural text descriptions with corresponding motion programs and 3D trajectories.

However, concerns related to safety, privacy, and copyright highlight the need for machine unlearning, which can make diffusion models forget specific training data and prevent the generation of sensitive or unwanted content. Current machine unlearning methods for diffusion models are primarily designed for conditional diffusion models and focus on unlearning specific data classes or features. Among these methods, finetuning-based machine unlearning methods are recognized for their efficiency and effectiveness, which update the parameters of pre-trained diffusion models by minimizing carefully designed loss functions. However, in this paper, we propose a novel attack named Diffusion Model Relearning Attack (DiMRA), which can reverse the finetuning-based machine unlearning methods, posing a significant vulnerability of this kind of technique. Without prior knowledge of the unlearning elements, DiMRA optimizes the unlearned diffusion model on an auxiliary dataset to reverse the unlearning, enabling the model to regenerate previously unlearned elements. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose a novel machine unlearning method for diffusion models, termed as Diffusion Model Unlearning by Memorization (DiMUM). Unlike traditional methods that focus on forgetting, DiMUM memorizes alternative data or features to replace targeted unlearning data or features in order to prevent generating such elements. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DiMRA in reversing state-of-the-art finetuning-based machine unlearning methods for diffusion models, highlighting the need for more robust solutions.

To mitigate overfitting to restoration behaviors when conditioned on 3DGS renderings, ReCamDriving adopts a two-stage training paradigm: the first stage uses camera poses for coarse control, while the second stage incorporates 3DGS renderings for fine-grained viewpoint and geometric guidance. Furthermore, we present a 3DGS-based cross-trajectory data curation strategy to eliminate the train-test gap in camera transformation patterns, enabling scalable multi-trajectory supervision from monocular videos. Based on this strategy, we construct the ParaDrive dataset, containing over 110K parallel-trajectory video pairs.

Interpretable Neural Networks for Time Series Regression by Learning to Mask and Aggregate", "comment": "12 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables", "summary": "Time series extrinsic regression (TSER) refers to the task of predicting a continuous target variable from an input time series. It appears in many domains, including healthcare, finance, environmental monitoring, and engineering. In these settings, accurate predictions and trustworthy reasoning are both essential. Although state-of-the-art TSER models achieve strong predictive performance, they typically operate as black boxes, making it difficult to understand which temporal patterns drive their decisions. Post-hoc interpretability techniques, such as feature attribution, aim to to explain how the model arrives at its predictions, but often produce coarse, noisy, or unstable explanations. Recently, inherently interpretable approaches based on concepts, additive decompositions, or symbolic regression, have emerged as promising alternatives. However, these approaches remain limited: they require explicit supervision on the concepts themselves, often cannot capture interactions between time-series features, lack expressiveness for complex temporal patterns, and struggle to scale to high-dimensional multivariate data.\n  To address these limitations, we propose MAGNETS (Mask-and-AGgregate NEtwork for Time Series), an inherently interpretable neural architecture for TSER. MAGNETS learns a compact set of human-understandable concepts without requiring any annotations. Each concept corresponds to a learned, mask-based aggregation over selected input features, explicitly revealing both which features drive predictions and when they matter in the sequence. Predictions are formed as combinations of these learned concepts through a transparent, additive structure, enabling clear insight into the model's decision process.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMAGNETS\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u6807\u6ce8\u5373\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u5185\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a9\u7801\u805a\u5408\u548c\u52a0\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9ad8\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u5916\u6e90\u56de\u5f52\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709TSER\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f46\u591a\u4e3a\u9ed1\u7bb1\uff1b\u540e\u9a8c\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u7c97\u7cd9\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u5185\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6982\u5ff5\u6807\u6ce8\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u5f31\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u9ad8\u7ef4\u591a\u5143\u65f6\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMAGNETS\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a9\u7801\uff08mask\uff09\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u805a\u5408\u673a\u5236\u81ea\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6982\u5ff5\uff1b\u9884\u6d4b\u7531\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6982\u5ff5\u7ebf\u6027\u53e0\u52a0\u6784\u6210\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b8c\u5168\u900f\u660e\u7684\u52a0\u6027\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "MAGNETS\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u7cbe\u7ec6\u3001\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5f52\u56e0\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4eba\u7c7b\u7406\u89e3\u5173\u952e\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ca\u5176\u4f5c\u7528\u65f6\u673a\u3002", "conclusion": "MAGNETS\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u76d1\u7763\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u80fd\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u5e8f\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5185\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91caTSER\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u4fe1\u65f6\u5e8f\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Most existing detection methods rely on complex and poorly interpretable architectures, which compromise interpretability and generalization.

Comprising an Image Feature Extractor (IFE) and shallow classifiers (e.g., SVM, MLP, or XGBoost) with model sizes ranging from 1,000 to 30,000 parameters, FeatureLens achieves high detection accuracy ranging from 97.8% to 99.75% in closed-set evaluation and 86.17% to 99.6% in generalization evaluation across FGSM, PGD, CW, and DAmageNet attacks, using only 51 dimensional features. By combining strong detection performance with excellent generalization, interpretability, and computational efficiency, FeatureLens offers a practical pathway toward transparent and effective adversarial defense.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFeatureLens\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u548c\u6d45\u5c42\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u68c0\u6d4b\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5728\u95ed\u96c6\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3001\u9ad8\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFeatureLens\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\uff08IFE\uff09\u548c\u6d45\u5c42\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff08\u5982SVM\u3001MLP\u6216XGBoost\uff09\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u752851\u7ef4\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u95ed\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe97.8%\u201399.75%\uff0c\u6cdb\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8fbe86.17%\u201399.6%\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8eFGSM\u3001PGD\u3001CW\u548cDAmageNet\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "conclusion": "FeatureLens\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u900f\u660e\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u9632\u5fa1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

This work provides a comprehensive treatment of Gaussian, quadratic cost OT and inner product GW (IGW) alignment, closing several gaps in the literature to broaden applicability. First, we treat the open problem of IGW alignment between uncentered Gaussians on separable Hilbert spaces by giving a closed-form expression up to a quadratic optimization over unitary operators, for which we derive tight analytic upper and lower bounds. If at least one Gaussian measure is centered, the solution reduces to a fully closed-form expression, which we further extend to an analytic solution for the IGW barycenter between centered Gaussians. We also present a reduction of Gaussian multimarginal OT with pairwise quadratic costs to a tractable optimization problem and provide an efficient algorithm to solve it using a rank-deficiency constraint.

However, challenges persist, especially in detecting small objects where the high resolution of these images and the small size of target objects often result in a loss of critical information in the deeper layers of conventional CNNs. Additionally, the extensive spatial redundancy and intricate background details typical in remote-sensing images tend to obscure these small targets. To address these challenges, we introduce Multi-Kernel Selection Network (MKSNet), a novel network architecture featuring a novel Multi-Kernel Selection mechanism. The MKS mechanism utilizes large convolutional kernels to effectively capture an extensive range of contextual information. This innovative design allows for adaptive kernel size selection, significantly enhancing the network's ability to dynamically process and emphasize crucial spatial details for small object detection. Furthermore, MKSNet also incorporates a dual attention mechanism, merging spatial and channel attention modules. The spatial attention module adaptively fine-tunes the spatial weights of feature maps, focusing more intensively on relevant regions while mitigating background noise. Simultaneously, the channel attention module optimizes channel information selection, improving feature representation and detection accuracy. Empirical evaluations on the DOTA-v1.0 and HRSC2016 benchmark demonstrate that MKSNet substantially surpasses existing state-of-the-art models in detecting small objects in remote sensing images.

We reformulate wind forecasting as observation-informed correction of a global numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. Rather than forecasting winds directly, we learn local correction patterns by assimilating the latest in-situ observations to adjust the Global Forecast System (GFS) output. We propose a transformer-based deep learning architecture that (i) handles irregular and time-varying observation sets through masking and set-based attention mechanisms, (ii) conditions predictions on recent observation-forecast pairs via cross-attention, and (iii) employs cyclical time embeddings and coordinate-aware location representations to enable single-pass inference at arbitrary spatial coordinates. We evaluate our model over the Atlantic Ocean using observations from the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS) as reference. The model reduces GFS 10-meter wind RMSE at all lead times up to 48 hours, achieving 45% improvement at 1-hour lead time and 13% improvement at 48-hour lead time. Spatial analyses reveal the most persistent improvements along coastlines and shipping routes, where observations are most abundant. The tokenized architecture naturally accommodates heterogeneous observing platforms (ships, buoys, tide gauges, and coastal stations) and produces both site-specific predictions and basin-scale gridded products in a single forward pass. These results demonstrate a practical, low-latency post-processing approach that complements NWP by learning to correct systematic forecast errors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u5f02\u6784\u3001\u65f6\u53d8\u7684\u6d77\u6d0b\u5b9e\u6d4b\u98ce\u901f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5bf9\u5168\u7403\u6570\u503c\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\uff08GFS\uff09\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u5c40\u90e8\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u534710\u7c73\u98ce\u901f\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8fd1\u5cb8\u548c\u822a\u7ebf\u533a\u57df\u6548\u679c\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "motivation": "\u6d77\u6d0b\u98ce\u901f\u89c2\u6d4b\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u5f02\u6784\u4e14\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f20\u7edf\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u62a5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7cbe\u5ea6\u53d7\u9650\uff1b\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u6709\u9650\u89c2\u6d4b\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u6821\u6b63NWP\u7cfb\u7edf\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u98ce\u901f\u9884\u62a5\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u2018\u89c2\u6d4b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684NWP\u8f93\u51fa\u6821\u6b63\u2019\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578bTransformer\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u91c7\u7528\u63a9\u7801\u4e0e\u96c6\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5229\u7528\u6700\u65b0\u89c2\u9884\u62a5\u5bf9\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5faa\u73af\u65f6\u95f4\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u5750\u6807\u611f\u77e5\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u4efb\u610f\u65f6\u7a7a\u5750\u6807\u7684\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u897f\u6d0b\u6d77\u57df\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u57281\u201348\u5c0f\u65f6\u9884\u62a5\u65f6\u6548\u5185\u5747\u964d\u4f4eGFS\u768410\u7c73\u98ce\u901fRMSE\uff0c1\u5c0f\u65f6\u548c48\u5c0f\u65f6\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u534745%\u548c13%\uff1b\u6539\u8fdb\u6700\u663e\u8457\u533a\u57df\u4e3a\u6d77\u5cb8\u7ebf\u548c\u4e3b\u8981\u822a\u8fd0\u8def\u7ebf\uff1b\u53ef\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u8239\u8236\u3001\u6d6e\u6807\u3001\u9a8c\u6f6e\u7ad9\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u89c2\u6d4b\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5e76\u540c\u6b65\u8f93\u51fa\u7ad9\u70b9\u7ea7\u548c\u6d77\u76c6\u5c3a\u5ea6\u683c\u70b9\u5316\u4ea7\u54c1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u5f3a\u7684NWP\u540e\u5904\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bef\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u8865\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u503c\u9884\u62a5\u5728\u6d77\u6d0b\u533a\u57df\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002"}}

However, prior work mainly targets large Vision Transformers and high-resolution datasets such as ImageNet. In contrast, small-image benchmarks like MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 remain widely used in education, prototyping, and research, yet have received little attention in the context of prompting. In this paper, we introduce \\textbf{Multi-Scale Visual Prompting (MSVP)}, a simple and generic module that learns a set of global, mid-scale, and local prompt maps fused with the input image via a lightweight $1 \\times 1$ convolution. MSVP is backbone-agnostic, adds less than $0.02\\%$ parameters, and significantly improves performance across CNN and Vision Transformer backbones.\n  We provide a unified benchmark on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 using a simple CNN, ResNet-18, and a small Vision Transformer. Our method yields consistent improvements with negligible computational overhead. We further include ablations on prompt scales, fusion strategies, and backbone architectures, along with qualitative analyzes using prompt visualizations and Grad-CAM. Our results demonstrate that multi-scale prompting provides an effective inductive bias even on low-resolution images.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\uff08MSVP\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u5168\u5c40\u3001\u4e2d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u63d0\u793a\u56fe\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u56fe\u50cf\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5982MNIST\u3001Fashion-MNIST\u3001CIFAR-10\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u53c2\u6570\u5c11\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u4f4e\u3001\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u65e0\u5173\u7b49\u4f18\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9762\u5411\u5927\u5c3a\u5bf8\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u5927\u578bViT\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7528\u4e8e\u6559\u5b66\u3001\u539f\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5c0f\u56fe\u50cf\u57fa\u51c6\uff08\u5982MNIST\u3001Fashion-MNIST\u3001CIFAR-10\uff09\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9002\u914d\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\uff08MSVP\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e09\u7c7b\u63d0\u793a\u56fe\uff08\u5168\u5c40\u3001\u4e2d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3001\u5c40\u90e8\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea71\u00d71\u5377\u79ef\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u878d\u5408\uff1b\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u589e\u52a0\u4e0d\u8db30.02%\u3002", "result": "\u5728MNIST\u3001Fashion-MNIST\u548cCIFAR-10\u4e0a\uff0cMSVP\u5728CNN\u3001ResNet-18\u548c\u5c0f\u578bViT\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff1b\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5206\u6790\uff08\u63d0\u793a\u56fe\u3001Grad-CAM\uff09\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u652f\u6301\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u4e3a\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Despite recent progress, existing STVG studies remain largely confined to object-centric and descriptive instructions, neglecting the task-oriented reasoning that is crucial for embodied agents to accomplish goal-directed interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce \\textbf{ToG-Bench}, the first task-oriented spatio-temporal video grounding benchmark for egocentric videos. ToG-Bench is characterized by three key features: (1) \\textbf{Task-oriented Grounding}, which requires identifying and localizing objects based on intended tasks rather than straightforward descriptions; (2) \\textbf{Explicit-Implicit Dual Grounding}, where target objects can be either explicitly mentioned or implicitly inferred by contextual reasoning; (3) \\textbf{One-to-Many Grounding}, where a single instruction may correspond to multiple objects involved in task execution. Built upon videos sourced from ScanNet, ToG-Bench comprises 100 annotated clips with 2,704 task-oriented grounding instructions, constructed via a semi-automated pipeline that combines foundation model annotation and human refinement. In addition, we introduce a set of task-level evaluation metrics tailored for multi-object and explicit-implicit object grounding, and systematically benchmark seven state-of-the-art MLLMs. Extensive experiments reveal the intrinsic challenges of task-oriented STVG and substantial performance gaps across explicit-implicit and multi-object grounding, highlighting the difficulty of bridging perception and interaction in embodied scenarios.

We begin by constructing ColonVQA, the most comprehensive multimodal dataset ever built for colonoscopy, featuring over 1.1M+ visual question answering entries across 76 clinical findings and 18 multimodal tasks. Beyond serving as a community-wide data foundation, we further investigate a critical yet underexplored transition in colonoscopy - evolving from multimodal understanding to clinical reasoning: (a) To capture the current landscape of multimodal understanding behaviors, we systematically assess the generalizability of 22 multimodal large language models and examine their reliability under human-induced perturbations. The results reveal that clinical outputs from leading MLLMs remain far from robust and trustworthy. (b) To narrow this gap, we further explore reasoning-centric intelligence tailored for colonoscopy. Specifically, we curate ColonReason, a clinically grounded reasoning dataset annotated through a multi-expert debating pipeline, and develop ColonR1, the first R1-styled model incorporating task-adaptive rewarding and gradient-stable optimization techniques. Under data-scarce conditions, our ColonR1 achieves 56.61% overall accuracy, outperforming supervised fine-tuning by 25.22%, and sets a new reasoning-enabled baseline for multimodal colonoscopy analysis.

However, as model size increases, the growing memory footprint and inference latency pose significant challenges for practical deployment. Recent studies in large language models (LLMs) show that rotation-based techniques can smooth outliers and enable 4-bit quantization, but these approaches often incur substantial overhead and struggle with row-wise outliers in diffusion transformers. To address these challenges, we propose ConvRot, a group-wise rotation-based quantization method that leverages regular Hadamard transform (RHT) to suppress both row-wise and column-wise outliers while reducing complexity from quadratic to linear. Building on this, we design ConvLinear4bit, a plug-and-play module that integrates rotation, quantization, GEMM, and dequantization, enabling W4A4 inference without retraining and preserving visual quality. Experiments on FLUX.1-dev demonstrate a 2.26$\\times$ speedup and 4.05$\\times$ memory reduction while maintaining image fidelity.

This paper introduces a unified deep learning framework that integrates cyclical temporal encoding with hybrid LSTM-CNN architectures to enhance multistep energy forecasting. We systematically transform calendar-based attributes using sine cosine encodings to preserve periodic structure and evaluate their predictive relevance through correlation analysis. To exploit both long-term seasonal effects and short-term local patterns, we employ an ensemble model composed of an LSTM, a CNN, and a meta-learner of MLP regressors specialized for each forecast horizon. Using a one year national consumption dataset, we conduct an extensive experimental study including ablation analyses with and without cyclical encodings and calendar features and comparisons with established baselines from the literature. Results demonstrate consistent improvements across all seven forecast horizons, with our hybrid model achieving lower RMSE and MAE than individual architectures and prior methods. These findings confirm the benefit of combining cyclical temporal representations with complementary deep learning structures.

Existing text-to-3D stylization methods typically distill from 2D image editors, requiring time-intensive per-asset optimization and exhibiting multi-view inconsistency due to the limitations of current text-to-image models, which makes them impractical for large-scale production. In this paper, we introduce GaussianBlender, a pioneering feed-forward framework for text-driven 3D stylization that performs edits instantly at inference.

However, most existing methods apply interventions uniformly across all inputs, degrading model performance when steering is unnecessary. We introduce Dynamically Scaled Activation Steering (DSAS), a method-agnostic steering framework that decouples when to steer from how to steer. DSAS adaptively modulates the strength of existing steering transformations across layers and inputs, intervening strongly only when undesired behavior is detected. At generation time, DSAS computes context-dependent scaling factors that selectively adjust the strength of any steering method. We also show how DSAS can be jointly optimized end-to-end together with the steering function. When combined with existing steering methods, DSAS consistently improves the Pareto front with respect to steering alone, achieving a better trade-off between toxicity mitigation and utility preservation. We further demonstrate DSAS's generality by applying it to a text-to-image diffusion model, showing how adaptive steering allows the modulation of specific concepts. Finally, DSAS introduces minimal computational overhead while improving interpretability, pinpointing which tokens require steering and by how much.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u7f29\u653e\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\uff08DSAS\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u8c03\u63a7\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u6bd2\u6027\u7f13\u89e3\u4e0e\u6548\u7528\u4fdd\u6301\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u8f93\u5165\u7edf\u4e00\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e0\u9700\u5f15\u5bfc\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u89e3\u8026\u2018\u4f55\u65f6\u5f15\u5bfc\u2019\u4e0e\u2018\u5982\u4f55\u5f15\u5bfc\u2019\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "DSAS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u5404\u5c42\u548c\u5404\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff1b\u652f\u6301\u4e0e\u5f15\u5bfc\u51fd\u6570\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "DSAS\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u6bd2\u6027\u7f13\u89e3\u4e0e\u6548\u7528\u4fdd\u7559\u7684Pareto\u524d\u6cbf\uff1b\u6210\u529f\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u9ad8\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DSAS\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

We discover that evolving feature semantics-particularly objective and subjective meanings-introduce concept drift over time. Crucially, we identify that feature transformation strategies are able to mitigate discrepancies in feature representations across temporal stages.

Deep perceptual losses, such as LPIPS, achieve good alignment but rely on complex, highly non-linear discriminative features with unknown invariances, while hand-crafted measures like SSIM are interpretable but miss key perceptual properties.\n  We introduce the Structured Uncertainty Similarity Score (SUSS); it models each image through a set of perceptual components, each represented by a structured multivariate Normal distribution. These are trained in a generative, self-supervised manner to assign high likelihood to human-imperceptible augmentations. The final score is a weighted sum of component log-probabilities with weights learned from human perceptual datasets. Unlike feature-based methods, SUSS learns image-specific linear transformations of residuals in pixel space, enabling transparent inspection through decorrelated residuals and sampling.\n  SUSS aligns closely with human perceptual judgments, shows strong perceptual calibration across diverse distortion types, and provides localized, interpretable explanations of its similarity assessments. We further demonstrate stable optimization behavior and competitive performance when using SUSS as a perceptual loss for downstream imaging tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5SUSS\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u5efa\u6a21\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u6570\u636e\u5b66\u4e60\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u6821\u51c6\u826f\u597d\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982LPIPS\u867d\u5bf9\u9f50\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u800cSSIM\u7b49\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6307\u6807\u867d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5374\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u5173\u952e\u611f\u77e5\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u517c\u987e\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "SUSS\u5c06\u6bcf\u5e45\u56fe\u50cf\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u611f\u77e5\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6210\u5206\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u591a\u5143\u6b63\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0d\u53ef\u5bdf\u89c9\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u53d8\u6362\u8d4b\u4e88\u9ad8\u4f3c\u7136\uff1b\u6700\u7ec8\u5f97\u5206\u662f\u5404\u6210\u5206\u5bf9\u6570\u6982\u7387\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u548c\uff0c\u6743\u91cd\u7531\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u6570\u636e\u5b66\u4e60\u5f97\u5230\uff1b\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u5b66\u4e60\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4\u6b8b\u5dee\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53bb\u76f8\u5173\u6b8b\u5dee\u5206\u6790\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "SUSS\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5931\u771f\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u611f\u77e5\u6821\u51c6\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u5224\u65ad\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u6e38\u6210\u50cf\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u635f\u5931\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f18\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "SUSS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u517c\u5177\u611f\u77e5\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u611f\u77e5\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Existing approaches cannot distinguish between true recovery and \"false recovery,\" where traffic metrics normalize, but the underlying system dynamics permanently degrade. To address this, a new physics-constrained Hamiltonian learning algorithm combining \"structural irreversibility detection\" and \"energy landscape reconstruction\" has been developed. Our approach extracts low-dimensional state representations, identifies quasi-Hamiltonian structures through physics-constrained optimization, and quantifies structural changes via energy landscape comparison. Analysis of London's extreme rainfall in 2021 demonstrates that while surface indicators were fully recovered, our algorithm detected 64.8\\% structural damage missed by traditional monitoring.

However, it remains unclear whether they learn similar internal representations of matter. Understanding their latent structure is essential for building scientific foundation models that generalize reliably beyond their training domains. Although representational convergence has been observed in language and vision, its counterpart in the sciences has not been systematically explored. Here, we show that representations learned by nearly sixty scientific models, spanning string-, graph-, 3D atomistic, and protein-based modalities, are highly aligned across a wide range of chemical systems. Models trained on different datasets have highly similar representations of small molecules, and machine learning interatomic potentials converge in representation space as they improve in performance, suggesting that foundation models learn a common underlying representation of physical reality. We then show two distinct regimes of scientific models: on inputs similar to those seen during training, high-performing models align closely and weak models diverge into local sub-optima in representation space; on vastly different structures from those seen during training, nearly all models collapse onto a low-information representation, indicating that today's models remain limited by training data and inductive bias and do not yet encode truly universal structure. Our findings establish representational alignment as a quantitative benchmark for foundation-level generality in scientific models. More broadly, our work can track the emergence of universal representations of matter as models scale, and for selecting and distilling models whose learned representations transfer best across modalities, domains of matter, and scientific tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u5b50\u3001\u6750\u6599\u548c\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u884c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd1\u516d\u5341\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5316\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8868\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u79d1\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7269\u7406\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u5171\u540c\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u57df\u5916\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4ecd\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u540c\u79d1\u5b66\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u662f\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u53ef\u9760\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff1b\u6b64\u524d\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u9886\u57df\u5df2\u6709\u8868\u5f81\u6536\u655b\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u5c1a\u672a\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u8fd1\u516d\u5341\u4e2a\u6db5\u76d6\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u3001\u56fe\u30013D\u539f\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u53ca\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u7b49\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5316\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8868\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6027\u80fd\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0e\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6cdb\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u8868\u5f81\u6536\u655b\u4e0e\u574d\u7f29\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "1\uff09\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c0f\u5206\u5b50\u4e0a\u8868\u5f81\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b2\uff09\u539f\u5b50\u95f4\u52bf\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u65f6\u8868\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u8d8b\u4e8e\u6536\u655b\uff1b3\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u57df\u5185\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u5f81\u7d27\u5bc6\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\u9677\u5165\u5c40\u90e8\u6b21\u4f18\uff1b4\uff09\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u51e0\u4e4e\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u574d\u7f29\u81f3\u4f4e\u4fe1\u606f\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8868\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u7528\u6027\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u57fa\u51c6\uff1b\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5c1a\u672a\u7f16\u7801\u771f\u6b63\u666e\u9002\u7684\u7269\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5176\u8868\u5f81\u80fd\u529b\u4ecd\u53d7\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u9650\u5236\uff1b\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u666e\u9002\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u5bfc\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u84b8\u998f\u3002"}}

Existing perturbation methods are frequently white-box and architecture specific. More importantly, while they are often successful, it is rarely clear why they work. Insights into the mechanism of this success would allow developers to understand and analyze these attacks, as well as fine-tune the model to prevent them. This paper presents BlackCAtt, a black-box algorithm and a tool, which uses minimal, causally sufficient pixel sets to construct explainable, imperceptible, reproducible, architecture-agnostic attacks on object detectors. BlackCAtt combines causal pixels with bounding boxes produced by object detectors to create adversarial attacks that lead to the loss, modification or addition of a bounding box. BlackCAtt works across different object detectors of different sizes and architectures, treating the detector as a black box. We compare the performance of BlackCAtt with other black-box attack methods and show that identification of causal pixels leads to more precisely targeted and less perceptible attacks. On the COCO test dataset, our approach is 2.7 times better than the baseline in removing a detection, 3.86 times better in changing a detection, and 5.75 times better in triggering new, spurious, detections.

Three gaps persist: (1) lack of joint training that integrates spatial and temporal representations, (2) origin-agnostic treatment that ignores directional asymmetries in navigation ($A \\to B \\ne B \\to A$), and (3) over-reliance on auxiliary data (POIs, imagery) rather than fundamental geometric properties of urban space. We introduce a conditional trajectory encoder that jointly learns spatial and movement representations while preserving origin-dependent asymmetries using geometric features. This framework decomposes urban navigation into shared cognitive patterns and origin-specific spatial narratives, enabling quantitative measurement of cognitive asymmetries across starting locations. Our bidirectional LSTM processes visibility ratio and curvature features conditioned on learnable origin embeddings, decomposing representations into shared urban patterns and origin-specific signatures through contrastive learning. Results from six synthetic cities and real-world validation on Beijing's Xicheng District demonstrate that urban morphology creates systematic cognitive inequalities. This provides urban planners quantitative tools for assessing experiential equity, offers architects insights into layout decisions' cognitive impacts, and enables origin-aware analytics for navigation systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u8f68\u8ff9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u8d77\u70b9\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u6bd4\u3001\u66f2\u7387\uff09\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u89e3\u57ce\u5e02\u5bfc\u822a\u4e3a\u5171\u4eab\u8ba4\u77e5\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u8d77\u70b9\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d9\u4e8b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u57ce\u5e02\u5f62\u6001\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8f68\u8ff9\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u65b9\u9762\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u8868\u5f81\u5272\u88c2\u3001\u5ffd\u7565\u5bfc\u822a\u65b9\u5411\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff08A\u2192B \u2260 B\u2192A\uff09\u3001\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56POI\u7b49\u8f85\u52a9\u6570\u636e\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u57ce\u5e02\u7a7a\u95f4\u57fa\u672c\u51e0\u4f55\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cc\u5411LSTM\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u8f68\u8ff9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8d77\u70b9\u5d4c\u5165\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u6bd4\u548c\u66f2\u7387\u7b49\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5c06\u8868\u5f81\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u5171\u4eab\u57ce\u5e02\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u8d77\u70b9\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u7b7e\u540d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u5408\u6210\u57ce\u5e02\u53ca\u5317\u4eac\u897f\u57ce\u533a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u57ce\u5e02\u5f62\u6001\u5bfc\u81f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\uff1b\u4e3a\u57ce\u5e02\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u5efa\u7b51\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u5bfc\u822a\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u8d77\u6e90\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u7a7a\u95f4\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u8f68\u8ff9\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u5e76\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u8d77\u70b9\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u516c\u5e73\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u57ce\u5e02\u667a\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8def\u5f84\uff1b\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u9a8c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8377\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

It first performs single-modality learning and then operates cross-modality learning to tackle the modality discrepancy. Although promising, this pipeline inevitably introduces modality bias: modality-specific cues learned in the single-modality training naturally propagate into the following cross-modality learning, impairing identity discrimination and generalization. To address this issue, we propose a Dual-level Modality Debiasing Learning (DMDL) framework that implements debiasing at both the model and optimization levels. At the model level, we propose a Causality-inspired Adjustment Intervention (CAI) module that replaces likelihood-based modeling with causal modeling, preventing modality-induced spurious patterns from being introduced, leading to a low-biased model. At the optimization level, a Collaborative Bias-free Training (CBT) strategy is introduced to interrupt the propagation of modality bias across data, labels, and features by integrating modality-specific augmentation, label refinement, and feature alignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DMDL could enable modality-invariant feature learning and a more generalized model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u5c42\u6b21\u6a21\u6001\u53bb\u504f\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff08DMDL\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u5efa\u6a21\uff08CAI\u6a21\u5757\uff09\u548c\u534f\u540c\u65e0\u504f\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08CBT\u7b56\u7565\uff09\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5c42\u9762\u6d88\u9664\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u53ef\u89c1\u5149-\u7ea2\u5916\u884c\u4eba\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8eab\u4efd\u5224\u522b\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65e0\u76d1\u7763VI-ReID\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f15\u5165\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u635f\u5bb3\u8eab\u4efd\u5224\u522b\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDual-level Modality Debiasing Learning\uff08DMDL\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u5c42\u9762\u8bbe\u8ba1\u56e0\u679c\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u8c03\u6574\u5e72\u9884\uff08CAI\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7528\u56e0\u679c\u5efa\u6a21\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f3c\u7136\u5efa\u6a21\u4ee5\u6291\u5236\u865a\u5047\u6a21\u6001\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u5c42\u9762\u8bbe\u8ba1\u534f\u540c\u65e0\u504f\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08CBT\uff09\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u589e\u5f3a\u3001\u6807\u7b7e\u7cbe\u70bc\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u6765\u963b\u65ad\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u5dee\u5728\u6570\u636e\u3001\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDMDL\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u53d8\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "DMDL\u4ece\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u53cc\u5c42\u6b21\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u884c\u4eba\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u56e0\u679c\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u534f\u540c\u53bb\u504f\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

While classical iterative optimization algorithms provide interpretability and theoretical guarantees, they often rely on surrogate objectives, require careful hyperparameter tuning, and exhibit substantial computational latency. Conversely, machine learning (ML ) offers powerful data-driven modeling capabilities but lacks the structure, transparency, and efficiency needed for optimization-driven inference. Deep unfolding has recently emerged as a compelling framework that bridges these two paradigms by systematically transforming iterative optimization algorithms into structured, trainable ML architectures. This article provides a tutorial-style overview of deep unfolding, presenting a unified perspective of methodologies for converting optimization solvers into ML models and highlighting their conceptual, theoretical, and practical implications. We review the foundations of optimization for inference and for learning, introduce four representative design paradigms for deep unfolding, and discuss the distinctive training schemes that arise from their iterative nature. Furthermore, we survey recent theoretical advances that establish convergence and generalization guarantees for unfolded optimizers, and provide comparative qualitative and empirical studies illustrating their relative trade-offs in complexity, interpretability, and robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5c55\u5f00\uff08deep unfolding\uff09\u8fd9\u4e00\u878d\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ecb\u7ecd\u5176\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8303\u5f0f\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u53ca\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u969c\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u867d\u5177\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4f46\u4f9d\u8d56\u4ee3\u7406\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u8d85\u53c2\u8c03\u4f18\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\uff1b\u800c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\uff0c\u5374\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u900f\u660e\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u878d\u5408\u4e8c\u8005\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u4ee5\u6559\u7a0b\u5f62\u5f0f\u68b3\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u5c55\u5f00\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u56db\u7c7b\u5178\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8303\u5f0f\u3001\u9002\u914d\u8fed\u4ee3\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u7efc\u8ff0\u5176\u6536\u655b\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5c55\u5f00\u5728\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u4ece\u4f18\u5316\u5230\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u5176\u6982\u5ff5\u5185\u6db5\u3001\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5bf9\u6bd4\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5c55\u5f00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5c55\u5f00\u662f\u8fde\u63a5\u7ecf\u5178\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u73b0\u4ee3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6865\u6881\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u9614\u7406\u8bba\u4ef7\u503c\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

In particular, digital traces derived from the phone's embedded movement sensors present an opportunity for a forensic investigator to gain insight into a person's physical activities. In this work, we present a machine learning-based approach to translate digital traces into likelihood ratios (LRs) for different types of physical activities. Evaluating on a new dataset, NFI\\_FARED, which contains digital traces from four different types of iPhones labelled with 19 activities, it was found that our approach could produce useful LR systems to distinguish 167 out of a possible 171 activity pairings. The same approach was extended to analyse likelihoods for multiple activities (or groups of activities) simultaneously and create activity timelines to aid in both the early and latter stages of forensic investigations.

These models are trained on large-scale datasets, like LAION-5B, often scraped from the internet. However, since this data contains numerous biases, the models inherently learn and reproduce them, resulting in stereotypical outputs. We introduce SelfDebias, a fully unsupervised test-time debiasing method applicable to any diffusion model that uses a UNet as its noise predictor. SelfDebias identifies semantic clusters in an image encoder's embedding space and uses these clusters to guide the diffusion process during inference, minimizing the KL divergence between the output distribution and the uniform distribution. Unlike supervised approaches, SelfDebias does not require human-annotated datasets or external classifiers trained for each generated concept. Instead, it is designed to automatically identify semantic modes. Extensive experiments show that SelfDebias generalizes across prompts and diffusion model architectures, including both conditional and unconditional models. It not only effectively debiases images along key demographic dimensions while maintaining the visual fidelity of the generated images, but also more abstract concepts for which identifying biases is also challenging.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSelfDebias\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u53bb\u504f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8eUNet\u566a\u58f0\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u8bed\u4e49\u7c07\u5e76\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684KL\u6563\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u578b\u56fa\u6709\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u6216\u5916\u90e8\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982LAION-5B\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u504f\u89c1\u800c\u751f\u6210\u523b\u677f\u5316\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u65e0\u9700\u76d1\u7763\u3001\u901a\u7528\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u53bb\u504f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "SelfDebias\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7c07\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u6b64\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\u7684KL\u6563\u5ea6\u5b9e\u73b0\u53bb\u504f\uff1b\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6216\u5916\u90e8\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3002", "result": "SelfDebias\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u542b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0e\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\uff09\u4e0a\u6cdb\u5316\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u5173\u952e\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u7ef4\u5ea6\u53ca\u66f4\u62bd\u8c61\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0a\u7684\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "SelfDebias\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u3001\u5b8c\u5168\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u53bb\u504f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u6446\u8131\u4e86\u5bf9\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5b9a\u5236\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002"}}

They are developed to provide criteria-based progression and standardize patient treatment, thereby improving care, reducing resource use, and accelerating patient recovery. However, manual modeling of these pathways based on clinical guidelines and domain expertise is difficult and may not reflect the actual best practices for different variations or combinations of diseases. We propose a two-phase modeling method using process mining, which extends the knowledge base of clinical pathways by leveraging conformance checking diagnostics. In the first phase, historical data of a given disease is collected to capture treatment in the form of a process model. In the second phase, new data is compared against the reference model to verify conformance. Based on the conformance checking results, the knowledge base can be expanded with more specific models tailored to new variants or disease combinations. We demonstrate our approach using Synthea, a benchmark dataset simulating patient treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infections with varying COVID-19 complications.

However, manual classification of brain tumor medical images is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Even with shallow convolutional neural network models, the accuracy is not ideal. To improve the efficiency and accuracy of brain tumor image classification, this paper proposes a brain tumor classification model based on an improved ResNet34 network. This model uses the ResNet34 residual network as the backbone network and incorporates multi-scale feature extraction. It uses a multi-scale input module as the first layer of the ResNet34 network and an Inception v2 module as the residual downsampling layer. Furthermore, a channel attention mechanism module assigns different weights to different channels of the image from a channel domain perspective, obtaining more important feature information. The results after a five-fold crossover experiment show that the average classification accuracy of the improved network model is approximately 98.8%, which is not only 1% higher than ResNet34, but also only 80% of the number of parameters of the original model. Therefore, the improved network model not only improves accuracy but also reduces clutter, achieving a classification effect with fewer parameters and higher accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdbResNet34\u7684\u8111\u80bf\u7624\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8f93\u5165\u3001Inception v2\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u901a\u9053\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u66f4\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u539f\u6a21\u578b80%\uff09\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u81f398.8%\uff0c\u8f83\u539f\u59cbResNet34\u63d0\u9ad81%\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u624b\u52a8\u5206\u7c7b\u8111\u80bf\u7624\u56fe\u50cf\u8017\u65f6\u8d39\u529b\uff0c\u6d45\u5c42CNN\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u7406\u60f3\uff0c\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u4ee5ResNet34\u4e3a\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8f93\u5165\u6a21\u5757\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9996\u5c42\u3001Inception v2\u6a21\u5757\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6b8b\u5dee\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u5c42\uff0c\u5e76\u52a0\u5165\u901a\u9053\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u7279\u5f81\u52a0\u6743\u3002", "result": "\u4e94\u6298\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe98.8%\uff0c\u6bd4ResNet34\u9ad81%\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u4ec5\u4e3a\u539f\u6a21\u578b\u768480%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u66f4\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

In this paper, we study novel deep learning technologies to effectively manage and analyse ECG data, with the aim of building a diagnostic model, accurately and quickly, that can substantially reduce the burden on medical workers. Unlike the existing ECG models that exhibit a high misdiagnosis rate, our deep learning approaches can automatically extract the features of ECG data through end-to-end training. Specifically, we first devise EfficientECG, an accurate and lightweight classification model for ECG analysis based on the existing EfficientNet model, which can effectively handle high-frequency long-sequence ECG data with various leading types. On top of that, we next propose a cross-attention-based feature fusion model of EfficientECG for analysing multi-lead ECG data with multiple features (e.g., gender and age).

Numerous studies have leveraged the robustness of decision-making in Reinforcement Learning (RL) to address the optimization challenges in algorithm configuration. However, applying RL to DAC is challenging and often requires extensive domain expertise. We conduct a comprehensive study of deep-RL algorithms in DAC through a systematic analysis of controlling the population size parameter of the (1+($\u03bb$,$\u03bb$))-GA on OneMax instances. Our investigation of DDQN and PPO reveals two fundamental challenges that limit their effectiveness in DAC: scalability degradation and learning instability. We trace these issues to two primary causes: under-exploration and planning horizon coverage, each of which can be effectively addressed through targeted solutions. To address under-exploration, we introduce an adaptive reward shifting mechanism that leverages reward distribution statistics to enhance DDQN agent exploration, eliminating the need for instance-specific hyperparameter tuning and ensuring consistent effectiveness across different problem scales. In dealing with the planning horizon coverage problem, we demonstrate that undiscounted learning effectively resolves it in DDQN, while PPO faces fundamental variance issues that necessitate alternative algorithmic designs. We further analyze the hyperparameter dependencies of PPO, showing that while hyperparameter optimization enhances learning stability, it consistently falls short in identifying effective policies across various configurations. Finally, we demonstrate that DDQN equipped with our adaptive reward shifting strategy achieves performance comparable to theoretically derived policies with vastly improved sample efficiency, outperforming prior DAC approaches by several orders of magnitude.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DDQN\u548cPPO\uff09\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u7b97\u6cd5\u914d\u7f6e\uff08DAC\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e24\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5956\u52b1\u504f\u79fb\u673a\u5236\uff08\u89e3\u51b3\u6b20\u63a2\u7d22\uff09\u548c\u65e0\u6298\u6263\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u89e3\u51b3\u89c4\u5212\u8303\u56f4\u8986\u76d6\uff09\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u4f7fDDQN\u5728\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u8fdc\u8d85\u73b0\u6709DAC\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u7b97\u6cd5\u914d\u7f6e\uff08DAC\uff09\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u4ee5\u63a7\u5236(1+(\u03bb,\u03bb))-GA\u5728OneMax\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u79cd\u7fa4\u89c4\u6a21\u53c2\u6570\u4e3a\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30DDQN\u4e0ePPO\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5956\u52b1\u504f\u79fb\u673a\u5236\u6539\u5584DDQN\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u65e0\u6298\u6263\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u5347\u89c4\u5212\u8986\u76d6\uff1b\u5bf9PPO\u8fdb\u884c\u8d85\u53c2\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "DDQN\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5956\u52b1\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u65e0\u6298\u6263\u5b66\u4e60\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8e\u7406\u8bba\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u4e14\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u51fa\u82e5\u5e72\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff1bPPO\u53d7\u65b9\u5dee\u548c\u8d85\u53c2\u5f3a\u4f9d\u8d56\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "DDQN\u7ecf\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\u540e\u6210\u4e3aDAC\u66f4\u4f18\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u800cPPO\u5728\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u5c40\u9650\uff1b\u6240\u63d0\u673a\u5236\u5177\u6709\u901a\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u4e8eRL\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u914d\u7f6e\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

This method achieves high-quality generation while accelerating synthesis. However, parallel token sampling within a scale may lead to structural errors, resulting in suboptimal generated images. To mitigate this, we propose Latent Scale Rejection Sampling (LSRS), a method that progressively refines token maps in the latent scale during inference to enhance VAR models. Our method uses a lightweight scoring model to evaluate multiple candidate token maps sampled at each scale, selecting the high-quality map to guide subsequent scale generation. By prioritizing early scales critical for structural coherence, LSRS effectively mitigates autoregressive error accumulation while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that LSRS significantly improves VAR's generation quality with minimal additional computational overhead. For the VAR-d30 model, LSRS increases the inference time by merely 1% while reducing its FID score from 1.95 to 1.78.

Existing audit methods are too costly to apply at regular time intervals to the wide range of available LLM APIs. This means that model updates are left largely unmonitored in practice. In this work, we show that while LLM log probabilities (logprobs) are usually non-deterministic, they can still be used as the basis for cost-effective continuous monitoring of LLM APIs. We apply a simple statistical test based on the average value of each token logprob, requesting only a single token of output. This is enough to detect changes as small as one step of fine-tuning, making this approach more sensitive than existing methods while being 1,000x cheaper.

A folding-based decoder deforms a 2D grid into 3D, enforcing manifold continuity while preserving geometric fidelity. Trained with Chamfer Distance (CD) and an orthogonality regularizer, the system is evaluated on ModelNet40 across varying Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) and bandwidths.

Recent works on this topic have proposed a variety of approaches for accurately measuring human breath rate, however they are either tested in near-ideal conditions, or produce results that are not sufficiently accurate. The present study proposes a more robust method to measure breath rate in humans with minimal hardware requirements using a combination of mathematical transforms with a relative deviation from the ground truth of less than 5%.

To this end, we introduce DVPO (Distributional Value Modeling with Risk-aware Policy Optimization), a new RL framework that combines conditional risk theory with distributional value modeling to better balance robustness and generalization. DVPO learns token-level value distributions to provide fine-grained supervision, and applies an asymmetric risk regularization to shape the distribution tails: it contracts the lower tail to dampen noisy negative deviations, while expanding the upper tail to preserve exploratory diversity.

Current Unet architectures iteratively downsample spatial resolution while increasing channel dimensions to preserve information content. Such a structure demands a large memory footprint, limiting training batch sizes and increasing inference latency. Channel pruning compresses Unet architecture without accuracy loss, but requires lengthy optimization and may not generalize across tasks and datasets. By investigating Unet pruning, we hypothesize that the final structure is the crucial factor, not the channel selection strategy of pruning. Based on our observations, we propose a lean Unet architecture (LUnet) with a compact, flat hierarchy where channels are not doubled as resolution is halved. We evaluate on a public MRI dataset allowing comparable reporting, as well as on two internal CT datasets. We show that a state-of-the-art pruning solution (STAMP) mainly prunes from the layers with the highest number of channels. Comparatively, simply eliminating a random channel at the pruning-identified layer or at the largest layer achieves similar or better performance. Our proposed LUnet with fixed architectures and over 30 times fewer parameters achieves performance comparable to both conventional Unet counterparts and data-adaptively pruned networks. The proposed lean Unet with constant channel count across layers requires far fewer parameters while achieving performance superior to standard Unet for the same total number of parameters.

Recent studies have shown how using traditionally trained estimators for this task can lead to suboptimal solutions. Using the actual decision cost as a loss function (called Decision Focused Learning) can address this issue, but with a severe loss of scalability at training time. To address this issue, we propose an acceleration method based on replacing costly loss function evaluations with an efficient surrogate. Unlike previously defined surrogates, our approach relies on unbiased estimators reducing the risk of spurious local optima and can provide information on its local confidence allowing one to switch to a fallback method when needed. Furthermore, the surrogate is designed for a black-box setting, which enables compensating for simplifications in the optimization model and account- ing for recourse actions during cost computation.

To address these issues and fully harness the useful information in videos, we propose a novel heatmap pooling network (HP-Net) for action recognition from videos, which extracts information-rich, robust and concise pooled features of the human body in videos through a feedback pooling module. The extracted pooled features demonstrate obvious performance advantages over the previously obtained pose data and heatmap features from videos. In addition, we design a spatial-motion co-learning module and a text refinement modulation module to integrate the extracted pooled features with other multimodal data, enabling more robust action recognition. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks namely NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, Toyota-Smarthome and UAV-Human consistently verify the effectiveness of our HP-Net, which outperforms the existing human action recognition methods.

First, despite pioneering the use of diffusion models in DD and delivering impressive performance, the vast majority of approaches paradoxically require a diffusion model pre-trained on the full target dataset, undermining the very purpose of DD and incurring prohibitive training costs. Second, although some methods turn to general text-to-image models without relying on such target-specific training, they suffer from a significant distributional mismatch, as the web-scale priors encapsulated in these foundation models fail to faithfully capture the target-specific semantics, leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose Core Distribution Alignment (CoDA), a framework that enables effective DD using only an off-the-shelf text-to-image model. Our key idea is to first identify the \"intrinsic core distribution\" of the target dataset using a robust density-based discovery mechanism. We then steer the generative process to align the generated samples with this core distribution. By doing so, CoDA effectively bridges the gap between general-purpose generative priors and target semantics, yielding highly representative distilled datasets. Extensive experiments suggest that, without relying on a generative model specifically trained on the target dataset, CoDA achieves performance on par with or even superior to previous methods with such reliance across all benchmarks, including ImageNet-1K and its subsets. Notably, it establishes a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 60.4% at the 50-images-per-class (IPC) setup on ImageNet-1K.

Previous efforts have primarily centered around studying more effective FSCIL approaches. By contrast, less attention was devoted to thinking the security issues in contributing to FSCIL. This paper aims to provide a holistic study of the impact of attacks on FSCIL. We first derive insights by systematically exploring how human expert-designed attack methods (i.e., PGD, FGSM) affect FSCIL. We find that those methods either fail to attack base classes, or suffer from huge labor costs due to relying on huge expert knowledge. This highlights the need to craft a specialized attack method for FSCIL. Grounded in these insights, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective ACraft method to automatically steer and discover optimal attack methods targeted at FSCIL by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) without human experts. Moreover, to improve the reasoning between LLMs and FSCIL, we introduce a novel Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) based reinforcement learning to optimize learning, making LLMs generate better attack methods in the next generation by establishing positive feedback.

No existing framework unifies these objectives within a single architecture while retaining generalization across imaging modalities and datasets. We introduce PULSE, a multi-task vision-language framework built on self-supervised representations and optimized through a composite supervision strategy that balances region overlap learning, pixel wise classification fidelity, and boundary aware IoU refinement. A multi-scale token reconstruction decoder enables anatomical segmentation, while shared global representations support disease classification and clinically grounded text output allowing the model to transition from pixels to structures and finally clinical reasoning within one architecture. Unlike prior task-specific pipelines, PULSE learns task-invariant cardiac priors, generalizes robustly across datasets, and can be adapted to new imaging modalities with minimal supervision. This moves the field closer to a scalable, foundation style cardiac analysis framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PULSE\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u8868\u793a\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7edf\u4e00\u5fc3\u810f\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u89e3\u5256\u5206\u5272\u3001\u75be\u75c5\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6210\u50cf\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5fc3\u810f\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89e3\u5256\u5206\u5272\u3001\u75be\u75c5\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u76f8\u4e92\u5272\u88c2\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u7edf\u4e00\u8fd9\u4e9b\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e0e\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5355\u4e00\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "method": "PULSE\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u590d\u5408\u76d1\u7763\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u517c\u987e\u533a\u57df\u91cd\u53e0\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u5206\u7c7b\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u611f\u77e5IoU\u4f18\u5316\uff09\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6token\u91cd\u5efa\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u89e3\u5256\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u5171\u4eab\u5168\u5c40\u8868\u5f81\u652f\u6301\u75be\u75c5\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "PULSE\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u5b8c\u6210\u4ece\u50cf\u7d20\u5230\u7ed3\u6784\u518d\u5230\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5168\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5fc3\u810f\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9c81\u68d2\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u4ec5\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u76d1\u7763\u9002\u914d\u65b0\u6210\u50cf\u6a21\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "PULSE\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u5fc3\u810f\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u5411\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5f0f\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u533b\u5b66AI\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, their definition through tools from algebraic topology without a clear probabilistic interpretation detaches them from commonly used theoretical frameworks in those areas. In this work we introduce a framework that explains fuzzy simplicial sets as marginals of probability measures on simplicial sets. In particular, this perspective shows that the fuzzy weights of UMAP arise from a generative model that samples Vietoris-Rips filtrations at random scales, yielding cumulative distribution functions of pairwise distances. More generally, the framework connects fuzzy simplicial sets to probabilistic models on the face poset, clarifies the relation between Kullback-Leibler divergence and fuzzy cross-entropy in this setting, and recovers standard t-norms and t-conorms via Boolean operations on the underlying simplicial sets. We then show how new embedding methods may be derived from this framework and illustrate this on an example where we generalize UMAP using \u010cech filtrations with triplet sampling. In summary, this probabilistic viewpoint provides a unified probabilistic theoretical foundation for fuzzy simplicial sets, clarifies the role of UMAP within this framework, and enables the systematic derivation of new dimensionality reduction methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u7387\u6d4b\u5ea6\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u5355\u7eaf\u590d\u5f62\u96c6\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06UMAP\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6743\u91cd\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u968f\u673a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0bVietoris-Rips\u6ee4\u8fc7\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u5206\u5e03\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u6a21\u7cca\u96c6\u5408\u4e0e\u6982\u7387\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u6563\u5ea6\u53ca\u903b\u8f91\u8fd0\u7b97\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u964d\u7ef4\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u6a21\u7cca\u5355\u7eaf\u590d\u5f62\u96c6\uff08\u5982UMAP\u4e2d\u6240\u7528\uff09\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u6982\u7387\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u4e0e\u4e3b\u6d41\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6982\u7387\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\u8131\u8282\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6982\u7387\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6a21\u7cca\u5355\u7eaf\u590d\u5f62\u96c6\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5355\u7eaf\u590d\u5f62\u96c6\u4e0a\u6982\u7387\u6d4b\u5ea6\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u5206\u5e03\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u968f\u673a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684Vietoris-Rips/\u010cech\u6ee4\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u9762\u504f\u5e8f\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u6a21\u7cca\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u4e0eKL\u6563\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5e03\u5c14\u8fd0\u7b97\u5bfc\u51fat-\u8303\u6570/t-\u4f59\u8303\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u63ed\u793aUMAP\u6a21\u7cca\u6743\u91cd\u672c\u8d28\u662f\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u5206\u5e03\u51fd\u6570\uff1b\u5efa\u7acb\u6a21\u7cca\u5355\u7eaf\u590d\u5f62\u96c6\u4e0e\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u53ca\u903b\u8f91\u8fd0\u7b97\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u8054\u7cfb\uff1b\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u010cech\u6ee4\u8fc7\u4e0e\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u65b0\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6982\u7387\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u6a21\u7cca\u5355\u7eaf\u590d\u5f62\u96c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u9610\u660e\u4e86UMAP\u7684\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u6784\u9020\u65b0\u578b\u6d41\u5f62\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u964d\u7ef4\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Existing methods primarily focus on spatial-domain modeling but neglect frequency-domain priors. Although the emerging Mamba architecture excels at long-range dependency modeling through patch-wise correlation analysis, its potential for frequency-domain feature extraction remains unexplored. To address this, we propose Frequency-Aware Mamba (FAMamba), a novel framework that integrates frequency guidance with sequence modeling for efficient image restoration. Our architecture consists of two key components: (1) a Dual-Branch Feature Extraction Block (DFEB) that enhances local-global interaction via bidirectional 2D frequency-adaptive scanning, dynamically adjusting traversal paths based on sub-band texture distributions; and (2) a Prior-Guided Block (PGB) that refines texture details through wavelet-based high-frequency residual learning, enabling high-quality image reconstruction with precise details. Meanwhile, we design a novel Adaptive Frequency Scanning Mechanism (AFSM) for the Mamba architecture, which enables the Mamba to achieve frequency-domain scanning across distinct subgraphs, thereby fully leveraging the texture distribution characteristics inherent in subgraph structures.

Traditional numerical methods suffer from mesh-dependent errors and high computational costs, while classical Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) face bottlenecks in parameter efficiency, high-dimensional expression, and strong nonlinear fitting. To address these limitations, we propose a Discrete Variable (DV)-Circuit Quantum-Classical Physics-Informed Neural Network (QCPINN) and apply it to three typical reservoir seepage models for the first time: the pressure diffusion equation for heterogeneous single-phase flow, the nonlinear Buckley-Leverett (BL) equation for two-phase waterflooding, and the convection-diffusion equation for compositional flow considering adsorption. The QCPINN integrates classical preprocessing/postprocessing networks with a DV quantum core, leveraging quantum superposition and entanglement to enhance high-dimensional feature mapping while embedding physical constraints to ensure solution consistency. We test three quantum circuit topologies (Cascade, Cross-mesh, Alternate) and demonstrate through numerical experiments that QCPINNs achieve high prediction accuracy with fewer parameters than classical PINNs. Specifically, the Alternate topology outperforms others in heterogeneous single-phase flow and two-phase BL equation simulations, while the Cascade topology excels in compositional flow with convection-dispersion-adsorption coupling. Our work verifies the feasibility of QCPINN for reservoir engineering applications, bridging the gap between quantum computing research and industrial practice in oil and gas engineering.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u79bb\u6563\u53d8\u91cf\uff08DV\uff09\u7535\u8def\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08QCPINN\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6c42\u89e3\u6cb9\u85cf\u6e17\u6d41\u4e09\u7c7b\u5178\u578b\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u62df\u5408\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfPINNs\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7f51\u683c\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u7ecf\u5178PINNs\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u3001\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8868\u8fbe\u548c\u5f3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u62df\u5408\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDV-Circuit QCPINN\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u7ecf\u5178\u9884/\u540e\u5904\u7406\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u53e0\u52a0\u548c\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684DV\u91cf\u5b50\u6838\u5fc3\uff0c\u5e76\u5d4c\u5165\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b\u6d4b\u8bd5Cascade\u3001Cross-mesh\u3001Alternate\u4e09\u79cd\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "QCPINN\u5728\u4e09\u7c7b\u6e17\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u538b\u529b\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u7a0b\u3001Buckley-Leverett\u65b9\u7a0b\u3001\u8003\u8651\u5438\u9644\u7684\u5bf9\u6d41-\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u7a0b\uff09\u4e2d\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u5c11\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178PINN\uff1bAlternate\u62d3\u6251\u5728\u5355\u76f8\u4e0e\u4e24\u76f8\u6d41\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff0cCascade\u5728\u7ec4\u5206\u6d41\u52a8\u4e2d\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "QCPINN\u9996\u6b21\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6cb9\u85cf\u5de5\u7a0b\u6e17\u6d41\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728\u6cb9\u6c14\u5de5\u4e1a\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u7684\u843d\u5730\u3002"}}

Consequently, the generalizability of AI models to populations from less digitized regions, such as the Middle East, is largely unknown. This motivates the public release of our dataset to support the development and validation of pathology AI models across globally diverse populations. We present 339 whole-slide images of prostate core needle biopsies from a consecutive series of 185 patients collected in Erbil, Iraq. The slides are associated with Gleason scores and International Society of Urological Pathology grades assigned independently by three pathologists. Scanning was performed using two high-throughput scanners (Leica and Hamamatsu) and one compact scanner (Grundium). All slides were de-identified and are provided in their native formats without further conversion.

Standard VAEs match latents to a simple prior, overlooking density structure in the data-space. DiVAE encourages the encoder to allocate posterior mass in proportion to data-space density and, when the prior is learnable, nudges the prior toward high-density regions. This is realized by adding a robust, precision-weighted penalty to the ELBO, incurring negligible computational overhead. On synthetic datasets, DiVAE (i) improves distributional alignment of latent log-densities to its ground truth counterpart, (ii) improves prior coverage, and (iii) yields better OOD uncertainty calibration.

In this work, we experiment with three distinct pre-training, intermediate fine-tuning, and downstream datasets and training objectives to explore their marginal benefits on a small 5M-parameter vision transformer. We find that while pre-training and fine-tuning always help our model but have diminishing returns, intermediate fine-tuning can actually show harmful impact on downstream performance, potentially due to dissimilarity in task mechanics. Taken together, our results suggest that small-scale ViTs benefit most from targeted pre-training and careful data selection, while indiscriminate stacking of intermediate tasks can waste compute and even degrade performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\uff085M\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u4e2d\u95f4\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u603b\u4f53\u6709\u76ca\u4f46\u6536\u76ca\u9012\u51cf\uff0c\u800c\u4e2d\u95f4\u5fae\u8c03\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u4efb\u52a1\u673a\u5236\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u53cd\u800c\u635f\u5bb3\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5c0f\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0b\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u4e2d\u95f4\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u4e0b\u6e38\u5fae\u8c03\uff09\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u8ba1\u7b97\u6d6a\u8d39\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u4e2d\u95f4\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ca\u76ee\u6807\u4e0a\u5f00\u5c55\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5404\u9636\u6bb5\u5bf9\u5c0fViT\uff085M\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u8fb9\u9645\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u5fae\u8c03\u59cb\u7ec8\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u8fb9\u9645\u9012\u51cf\uff1b\u4e2d\u95f4\u5fae\u8c03\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63a8\u6d4b\u6e90\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u673a\u5236\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21ViT\u66f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u76f2\u76ee\u53e0\u52a0\u4e2d\u95f4\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6d6a\u8d39\u7b97\u529b\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u80fd\u635f\u5bb3\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While image data presents an extensive literature of distillation methods, text dataset distillation has fewer works in comparison. Text dataset distillation initially grew as an adaptation of efforts from the vision universe, as the particularities of the modality became clear obstacles, it rose into a separate branch of research. Several milestones mark the development of this area, such as the introduction of methods that use transformer models, the generation of discrete synthetic text, and the scaling to decoder-only models with over 1B parameters. Despite major advances in modern approaches, the field remains in a maturing phase, with room for improvement on benchmarking standardization, approaches to overcome the discrete nature of text, handling complex tasks, and providing explicit examples of real-world applications.

However, such approaches fail to distinguish between high-value and low-value actions in their regularization components. We introduce Guided Flow Policy (GFP), which couples a multi-step flow-matching policy with a distilled one-step actor. The actor directs the flow policy through weighted behavior cloning to focus on cloning high-value actions from the dataset rather than indiscriminately imitating all state-action pairs. In turn, the flow policy constrains the actor to remain aligned with the dataset's best transitions while maximizing the critic. This mutual guidance enables GFP to achieve state-of-the-art performance across 144 state and pixel-based tasks from the OGBench, Minari, and D4RL benchmarks, with substantial gains on suboptimal datasets and challenging tasks.

However, objectively accurate methods to early detect local regrowth (LR) from follow-up endoscopy images during WW are essential to manage care and prevent distant metastases. Hence, we developed a Siamese Swin Transformer with Dual Cross-Attention (SSDCA) to combine longitudinal endoscopic images at restaging and follow-up and distinguish cCR from LR. SSDCA leverages pretrained Swin transformers to extract domain agnostic features and enhance robustness to imaging variations. Dual cross attention is implemented to emphasize features from the two scans without requiring any spatial alignment of images to predict response. SSDCA as well as Swin-based baselines were trained using image pairs from 135 patients and evaluated on a held-out set of image pairs from 62 patients.

Beyond generic safety filters, enterprises require reliable mechanisms to detect policy violations within their regulatory and operational frameworks, where breaches can trigger legal and reputational risks. Existing content moderation frameworks, such as guardrails, remain largely confined to the safety domain and lack the robustness to capture nuanced organizational policies. LLM-as-a-judge and fine-tuning approaches, though flexible, introduce significant latency and lack interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free and efficient method that treats policy violation detection as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem. Inspired by whitening techniques, we apply a linear transformation to decorrelate the model's hidden activations and standardize them to zero mean and unit variance, yielding near-identity covariance matrix. In this transformed space, we use the Euclidean norm as a compliance score to detect policy violations. The method requires only the policy text and a small number of illustrative samples, which makes it light-weight and easily deployable. On a challenging policy benchmark, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing both existing guardrails and fine-tuned reasoning models. This work provides organizations with a practical and statistically grounded framework for policy-aware oversight of LLMs, advancing the broader goal of deployable AI governance.

Zero-shot techniques aim to adapt image diffusion models for videos without requiring further model training.

In this paper, we present FRESCO, which integrates intra-frame correspondence with inter-frame correspondence to formulate a more robust spatial-temporal constraint. This enhancement ensures a consistent transformation of semantically similar content between frames. Our method goes beyond attention guidance to explicitly optimize features, achieving high spatial-temporal consistency with the input video, significantly enhancing the visual coherence of manipulated videos. We verify FRESCO adaptations on two zero-shot tasks of video-to-video translation and text-guided video editing.

Pure data-driven methods lack physical explanations and have poor generalization when observed data is sparse. In contrast, physical models have difficulty integrating uncertainties and capturing the real complexity of traffic. To bridge this gap, recent studies have explored combining them by embedding physical structure into Gaussian process. These approaches typically introduce the governing equations as soft constraints through pseudo-observations, enabling the integration of model structure within a variational framework. However, these methods rely heavily on penalty tuning and lack principled uncertainty calibration, which makes them sensitive to model mis-specification. In this work, we address these limitations by presenting a novel Physics-Embedded Gaussian Process (PEGP), designed to integrate domain knowledge with data-driven methods in traffic state estimation. Specifically, we design two multi-output kernels informed by classic traffic flow models, constructed via the explicit application of the linearized differential operator. Experiments on HighD, NGSIM show consistent improvements over non-physics baselines.

Current methods predominantly focus on generating one modality given another as the condition or integrating either of them with other modalities such as text and audio. Unifying 2D videos and 3D motions for simultaneous optimization and generation remains largely unexplored, presenting significant challenges due to their substantial structural and distributional differences. Inspired by the LLM's ability to unify different modalities, our method models videos and 3D motions as a unified tokens sequence, utilizing separate embedding layers to mitigate distribution gaps. Additionally, we devise a sequence modeling strategy that integrates two distinct tasks within a single framework, proving the effectiveness of unified modeling. Moreover, to efficiently align with visual tokens and preserve 3D spatial information, we design a novel 3D motion tokenizer with a temporal expansion strategy, using a single VQ-VAE to produce quantized motion tokens. It features multiple expert decoders that handle body shapes, translation, global orientation, and body poses for reliable 3D motion reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method simultaneously generates corresponding videos and motions while performing accurate motion capture.

To address it, we present a Blur Diffusion Model (BlurDM), which seamlessly integrates the blur formation process into diffusion for image deblurring. Observing that motion blur stems from continuous exposure, BlurDM implicitly models the blur formation process through a dual-diffusion forward scheme, diffusing both noise and blur onto a sharp image. During the reverse generation process, we derive a dual denoising and deblurring formulation, enabling BlurDM to recover the sharp image by simultaneously denoising and deblurring, given pure Gaussian noise conditioned on the blurred image as input. Additionally, to efficiently integrate BlurDM into deblurring networks, we perform BlurDM in the latent space, forming a flexible prior generation network for deblurring. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BlurDM significantly and consistently enhances existing deblurring methods on four benchmark datasets.

CE and squared loss generate fundamentally different dynamics, and convex linear models cannot capture the complexities of non-convex optimization. We provide an in-depth characterization of multi-class CE optimization dynamics beyond the convex regime by analyzing a canonical two-layer linear neural network with standard-basis vectors as inputs: the simplest non-convex extension for which the implicit bias remained unknown. This model coincides with the unconstrained features model used to study neural collapse, making our work the first to prove that gradient flow on CE converges to the neural collapse geometry. We construct an explicit Lyapunov function that establishes global convergence, despite the presence of spurious critical points in the non-convex landscape. A key insight underlying our analysis is an inconspicuous finding: Hadamard Initialization diagonalizes the softmax operator, freezing the singular vectors of the weight matrices and reducing the dynamics entirely to their singular values.

However, when addressing real-world degradations, model performance is limited by the quality of ground-truth images in datasets due to practical constraints in data acquisition. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that enhances existing ground truth images to provide higher-quality supervision for real-world restoration. Our framework generates perceptually enhanced ground truth images using super-resolution by incorporating adaptive frequency masks, which are learned by a conditional frequency mask generator. These masks guide the optimal fusion of frequency components from the original ground truth and its super-resolved variants, yielding enhanced ground truth images. This frequency-domain mixup preserves the semantic consistency of the original content while selectively enriching perceptual details, preventing hallucinated artifacts that could compromise fidelity. The enhanced ground truth images are used to train a lightweight output refinement network that can be seamlessly integrated with existing restoration models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently improves the quality of restored images. We further validate the effectiveness of both supervision enhancement and output refinement through user studies.

DIQ-H applies physics-based corruptions including motion blur, sensor noise, and compression artifacts, and measures hallucination persistence, error recovery, and temporal consistency through multi-turn question-answering tasks. To enable scalable annotation, we propose Uncertainty-Guided Iterative Refinement (UIR), which generates reliable pseudo-ground-truth using lightweight VLMs with uncertainty filtering, achieving a 15.3 percent accuracy improvement.

However, those data providers, and, in general, the public, lack methods to efficiently verify that models trained on their data satisfy DP guarantees. The amount of compute needed to verify DP guarantees for current algorithms scales with the amount of compute required to train the model. In this paper we design the first DP algorithm with near optimal privacy-utility trade-offs but whose DP guarantees can be verified cheaper than training. We focus on DP stochastic convex optimization (DP-SCO), where optimal privacy-utility trade-offs are known. Here we show we can obtain tight privacy-utility trade-offs by privately minimizing a series of regularized objectives and only using the standard DP composition bound. Crucially, this method can be verified with much less compute than training.

However, in text-to-image(T2I) diffusion models, most related works focus on search strategies and reward models, yet the impact of the stochastic characteristic of noise in T2I diffusion models on the method's performance remains unexplored. In this work, we analyze the effects of randomness in T2I diffusion models and explore a new format of randomness for TTS: text embedding perturbation, which couples with existing randomness like SDE-injected noise to enhance generative diversity and quality. We start with a frequency-domain analysis of these formats of randomness and their impact on generation, and find that these two randomness exhibit complementary behavior in the frequency domain: spatial noise favors low-frequency components (early steps), while text embedding perturbation enhances high-frequency details (later steps), thereby compensating for the potential limitations of spatial noise randomness in high-frequency manipulation. Concurrently, text embedding demonstrates varying levels of tolerance to perturbation across different dimensions of the generation process. Specifically, our method consists of two key designs: (1) Introducing step-based text embedding perturbation, combining frequency-guided noise schedules with spatial noise perturbation. (2) Adapting the perturbation intensity selectively based on their frequency-specific contributions to generation and tolerance to perturbation. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated into existing TTS methods and demonstrates significant improvements on multiple benchmarks with almost no additional computation.

We provide the first theoretical explanation for this phenomenon through the lens of information theory. We prove that supervised learning on single-domain data inevitably produces domain feature collapse -- representations where I(x_d; z) = 0, meaning domain-specific information is completely discarded. This is a fundamental consequence of information bottleneck optimization: models trained on single domains (e.g., medical images) learn to rely solely on class-specific features while discarding domain features, leading to catastrophic failure when detecting out-of-domain samples (e.g., achieving only 53% FPR@95 on MNIST). We extend our analysis using Fano's inequality to quantify partial collapse in practical scenarios. To validate our theory, we introduce Domain Bench, a benchmark of single-domain datasets, and demonstrate that preserving I(x_d; z) > 0 through domain filtering (using pretrained representations) resolves the failure mode. While domain filtering itself is conceptually straightforward, its effectiveness provides strong empirical evidence for our information-theoretic framework.

While reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been explored for improving temporal reasoning, existing approaches are often confined to limited task types and data, restricting their generalization across diverse temporal understanding scenarios. To address this challenge, we present TempR1, a temporal-aware multi-task reinforcement learning framework that systematically strengthens MLLMs' temporal comprehension. We curate a multi-task corpus that exposes the model to diverse temporal structures and semantics, and build upon the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to achieve stable and effective cross-task optimization.

We first identify and validate a query typology distinguishing between global query and localized query. We demonstrate that while uniform sampling is both effective and efficient for global queries, localized queries indeed necessitate query-aware selection for optimal performance. Building on this insight, we propose DIG, a training-free frame selection framework that adapts its strategy based on the query type. Specifically,DIG employs efficient uniform sampling for global queries while activating a specialized pipeline to extract query-relevant frames for localized queries.

Open-weight language models pose acute challenges for such watermarking schemes because the inference-time interventions that dominate contemporary approaches cannot be enforced once model weights are public. Existing watermaking techniques for open-weight models, such as the recently proposed GaussMark, typically rely on small modifications to model weights, which can yield signals detectable to those equipped with a secret key, but achieving detection power comparable to inference-time watermarks generally requires weight perturbations that noticeably reduce generation quality. We introduce MarkTune, a theoretically principled, on-policy fine-tuning framework that treats the GaussMark signal as a reward while simultaneously regularizing against degradation in text quality. We derive MarkTune as an improvement on GaussMark and demonstrate that MarkTune consistently improves the quality-detectability trade-off over GaussMark by steering finer-grained, watermark-aware weight updates within the model's representation space while preserving generation quality. Empirically, we show that MarkTune pushes the quality-detectability frontier of GaussMark close to that of inference-time watermarking, remains robust to paraphrasing and fine-tuning attacks, and exhibits strong generalization: a model fine-tuned on one dataset retains substantial watermark detection power on unseen datasets.

While both paradigms have shown promise, existing methods struggle to simultaneously achieve high identity fidelity and flexible text controllability. We introduce UniID, a unified tuning-free framework that synergistically integrates both paradigms. Our key insight is that when merging these approaches, they should mutually reinforce only identity-relevant information while preserving the original diffusion prior for non-identity attributes. We realize this through a principled training-inference strategy: during training, we employ an identity-focused learning scheme that guides both branches to capture identity features exclusively; at inference, we introduce a normalized rescaling mechanism that recovers the text controllability of the base diffusion model while enabling complementary identity signals to enhance each other. This principled design enables UniID to achieve high-fidelity face personalization with flexible text controllability. Extensive experiments against six state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that UniID achieves superior performance in both identity preservation and text controllability.

This challenge has driven the development of efficient attention mechanisms, with sparsity emerging as the dominant paradigm. Current methods typically retain or discard entire key-value blocks with binary masks, resulting in substantial information loss under high sparsity. To mitigate this gap, we present Pyramid Sparse Attention (PSA), a versatile module applicable to both video understanding and generation tasks. Instead of binary masking, PSA introduces multi-level pooled KV representations, enabling finer mask granularity. Specifically, each query block dynamically allocates lower pooling levels to critical KV blocks and higher levels to less important ones, creating an informative interpolation between full retention and complete pruning. This design, analogous to fixed-point quantization and classical feature pyramid networks in computer vision, effectively mitigates information loss while preserving computational efficiency under a low compute budget. It works with a native, hardware-friendly kernel that leverages decoupled block-tile design to ensure efficient execution. Across video understanding and generation benchmarks, PSA preserves contextual information and visual fidelity, consistently outperforming or achieving comparable performance over existing sparse attention baselines with superior efficiency-quality trade-offs.

However, existing methods rely heavily on manually provided masks and textual prompts to preserve semantic fidelity and motion precision. Removing these constraints creates a fundamental trade-off: visual artifacts without masks and poor spatial control without prompts. To address these limitations, we propose DirectDrag, a novel mask- and prompt-free editing framework. DirectDrag enables precise and efficient manipulation with minimal user input while maintaining high image fidelity and accurate point alignment. DirectDrag introduces two key innovations. First, we design an Auto Soft Mask Generation module that intelligently infers editable regions from point displacement, automatically localizing deformation along movement paths while preserving contextual integrity through the generative model's inherent capacity. Second, we develop a Readout-Guided Feature Alignment mechanism that leverages intermediate diffusion activations to maintain structural consistency during point-based edits, substantially improving visual fidelity. Despite operating without manual mask or prompt, DirectDrag achieves superior image quality compared to existing methods while maintaining competitive drag accuracy.

However, such policies are contextually dependent on factors such as user preferences or modality. For example, enumerating multiple possible user intentions is cumbersome on small screens or in a voice setting. In this work, we propose to train steerable policies for managing this uncertainty using self-play. Given two agents, one simulating a user and the other an AI assistant, we generate conversations where the user issues a potentially ambiguous query, and the assistant needs to determine how to respond. Importantly, the model takes as input the numerical cost of each clarification question, and each generated word, and is asked to take the action that will maximize its final reward, which is the cost-penalized accuracy. We use Reinforced Self-Training (ReST) to train our model to achieve high reward and show this leads to a steerable policy that changes its behavior predictably conditioned on the provided costs, leading to higher reward and accuracy.

However, these models still struggle when faced with complex multi-step reasoning tasks. In this paper, we propose the Multi-Layered Self-Reflection with Auto-Prompting (MAPS) framework, a novel approach designed to enhance multi-step mathematical reasoning in LLMs by integrating techniques such as Chain of Thought (CoT), Self-Reflection, and Auto-Prompting. Unlike traditional static prompting methods, MAPS employs an iterative refinement process. Initially, the model generates a solution using CoT prompting. When errors are detected, an adaptive self-reflection mechanism identifies and analyzes them, generating tailored prompts to guide corrections. These dynamically adjusted prompts enable the model to iteratively refine its reasoning. Experiments on four well-established benchmarks across multiple LLMs show that MAPS significantly outperforms standard CoT and achieves competitive results with reasoning-optimized models. In addition, MAPS enables general-purpose LLMs to reach performance levels comparable to specialized reasoning models. While deeper reflection layers improve accuracy, they also increase token usage and costs. To balance this trade-off, MAPS strategically limits reflection depth, ensuring an optimal balance between cost and reasoning performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMAPS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u91c7\u7528\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u9519\u8bef\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u793a\u4ee5\u5f15\u5bfc\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u901a\u7528\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u5230\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e13\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u5c42\u81ea\u53cd\u5c04\u4e0e\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\uff08MAPS\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08CoT\uff09\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8fed\u4ee3\u5f0f\u9519\u8bef\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMAPS\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6CoT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u4e13\u95e8\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u80fd\u5e73\u8861\u63a8\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "MAPS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u901a\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u6b65\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

While traditional Structure-from-Motion pipelines handle such cases through geometric verification and outlier rejection, feed-forward 3D reconstruction models lack these explicit mechanisms, leading to degraded performance under in-the-wild conditions. In this paper, we discover that the existing feed-forward reconstruction model, e.g., VGGT, despite lacking explicit outlier-rejection mechanisms or noise-aware training, can inherently distinguish distractor images. Through an in-depth analysis under varying proportions of synthetic distractors, we identify a specific layer that naturally exhibits outlier-suppressing behavior. Further probing reveals that this layer encodes discriminative internal representations that enable an effective noise-filtering capability, which we simply leverage to perform outlier-view rejection in feed-forward 3D reconstruction without any additional fine-tuning or supervision.

Prior works applying group-theoretic priors or modeling transformations typically operate in the high-dimensional data space, where group actions apply uniformly across the entire input, making it difficult to disentangle the subspace that varies under transformations. While latent-space methods offer greater flexibility, they still require manual partitioning of latent variables into equivariant and invariant subspaces, limiting the ability to robustly learn and operate group actions within the representation space. To address this, we introduce a novel end-to-end framework that for the first time learns group actions on latent image manifolds, automatically discovering transformation-relevant structures without manual intervention. Our method uses learnable binary masks with straight-through estimation to dynamically partition latent representations into transformation-sensitive and invariant components. We formulate this within a unified optimization framework that jointly learns latent disentanglement and group transformation mappings. The framework can be seamlessly integrated with any standard encoder-decoder architecture. We validate our approach on five 2D/3D image datasets, demonstrating its ability to automatically learn disentangled latent factors for group actions in diverse data, while downstream classification tasks confirm the effectiveness of the learned representations.

Among these INR-based video codecs, Neural Video Representation Compression (NVRC) was the first to adopt a fully end-to-end compression framework that compresses INRs, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, some recently proposed lightweight INRs have shown comparable performance to their baseline codecs with computational complexity lower than 10kMACs/pixel. In this work, we extend NVRC toward lightweight representations, and propose NVRC-Lite, which incorporates two key changes. Firstly, we integrated multi-scale feature grids into our lightweight neural representation, and the use of higher resolution grids significantly improves the performance of INRs at low complexity. Secondly, we address the issue that existing INRs typically leverage autoregressive models for entropy coding: these are effective but impractical due to their slow coding speed. In this work, we propose an octree-based context model for entropy coding high-dimensional feature grids, which accelerates the entropy coding module of the model. Our experimental results demonstrate that NVRC-Lite outperforms C3, one of the best lightweight INR-based video codecs, with up to 21.03% and 23.06% BD-rate savings when measured in PSNR and MS-SSIM, respectively, while achieving 8.4x encoding and 2.5x decoding speedup.

Recent approaches use per-pixel 3D Gaussian Splatting for reconstruction, followed by a 2D-to-3D feature lifting stage for scene understanding. However, they generate excessive redundant Gaussians, causing high memory overhead and sub-optimal multi-view feature aggregation, leading to degraded novel view synthesis and scene understanding performance. We propose C3G, a novel feed-forward framework that estimates compact 3D Gaussians only at essential spatial locations, minimizing redundancy while enabling effective feature lifting. We introduce learnable tokens that aggregate multi-view features through self-attention to guide Gaussian generation, ensuring each Gaussian integrates relevant visual features across views. We then exploit the learned attention patterns for Gaussian decoding to efficiently lift features. Extensive experiments on pose-free novel view synthesis, 3D open-vocabulary segmentation, and view-invariant feature aggregation demonstrate our approach's effectiveness.

However, most existing approaches address only one of these aspects in isolation, as achieving all three simultaneously is highly challenging-for example, long-term memory mechanisms often degrade real-time performance. In this work, we present RELIC, a unified framework that tackles these three challenges altogether. Given a single image and a text description, RELIC enables memory-aware, long-duration exploration of arbitrary scenes in real time. Built upon recent autoregressive video-diffusion distillation techniques, our model represents long-horizon memory using highly compressed historical latent tokens encoded with both relative actions and absolute camera poses within the KV cache. This compact, camera-aware memory structure supports implicit 3D-consistent content retrieval and enforces long-term coherence with minimal computational overhead. In parallel, we fine-tune a bidirectional teacher video model to generate sequences beyond its original 5-second training horizon, and transform it into a causal student generator using a new memory-efficient self-forcing paradigm that enables full-context distillation over long-duration teacher as well as long student self-rollouts. Implemented as a 14B-parameter model and trained on a curated Unreal Engine-rendered dataset, RELIC achieves real-time generation at 16 FPS while demonstrating more accurate action following, more stable long-horizon streaming, and more robust spatial-memory retrieval compared with prior work. These capabilities establish RELIC as a strong foundation for the next generation of interactive world modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86RELIC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u6b63\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u6d41\u5f0f\u5904\u7406\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u7528\u6237\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u6f5c\u5728\u6807\u8bb0\u3001\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u7f16\u7801\u4e0e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u84b8\u998f\u6280\u672f\uff0cRELIC\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bb0\u5fc6\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u89e3\u51b3\u5b9e\u65f6\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u6d41\u5f0f\u5904\u7406\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6216\u7528\u6237\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u4e09\u8005\u517c\u987e\uff1b\u5c24\u5176\u957f\u65f6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u5e38\u635f\u5bb3\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u84b8\u998f\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528KV\u7f13\u5b58\u4e2d\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u6f5c\u5728\u6807\u8bb0\uff08\u542b\u76f8\u5bf9\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e0e\u7edd\u5bf9\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u59ff\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u76f8\u673a\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u81ea\u5f3a\u5236\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u53cc\u5411\u6559\u5e08\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u84b8\u998f\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u5b66\u751f\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u957f\u65f6\u6559\u5e08\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0e\u5b66\u751f\u81ea\u6eda\u52a8\u84b8\u998f\u3002", "result": "RELIC\u4f5c\u4e3a14B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728Unreal Engine\u6e32\u67d3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f616FPS\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u9075\u5faa\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u6d41\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u53ca\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bb0\u5fc6\u68c0\u7d22\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002", "conclusion": "RELIC\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u4e09\u5927\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Recent advances have explored automating this process using Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), yet existing methods often produce geometrically inaccurate layouts and lack the iterative, layer-specific editing required in professional workflows. To address these limitations, we present PosterCopilot, a framework that advances layout reasoning and controllable editing for professional graphic design. Specifically, we introduce a progressive three-stage training strategy that equips LMMs with geometric understanding and aesthetic reasoning for layout design, consisting of Perturbed Supervised Fine-Tuning, Reinforcement Learning for Visual-Reality Alignment, and Reinforcement Learning from Aesthetic Feedback. Furthermore, we develop a complete workflow that couples the trained LMM-based design model with generative models, enabling layer-controllable, iterative editing for precise element refinement while maintaining global visual consistency.

Prior works usually suffer from two limitations. First, they add random noise to training samples or VAE latents as data augmentation, introducing complex pipelines including extra noising and denoising steps. Second, they use a pretrained and frozen VAE encoder, resulting in suboptimal reconstruction and generation quality. In this paper, we find that the two issues can be solved in a very simple way: just fixing the variance (which would otherwise be predicted by the VAE encoder) to a constant (e.g., 0.5). On the one hand, this method allows the encoder to output a broader distribution of tokens and the decoder to learn to reconstruct clean images from the augmented token distribution, avoiding additional noise or denoising design. On the other hand, fixed variance simplifies the VAE evidence lower bound, making it stable to train an NF with a VAE jointly. On the ImageNet $256 \\times 256$ generation task, our model SimFlow obtains a gFID score of 2.15, outperforming the state-of-the-art method STARFlow (gFID 2.40).

We leverage the multiple viewpoints naturally captured within a single life to learn a visual encoder in a self-supervised manner. Our experiments demonstrate three key findings. First, models trained independently on different lives develop a highly aligned geometric understanding. We demonstrate this by training visual encoders on distinct datasets each capturing a different life, both indoors and outdoors, as well as introducing a novel cross-attention-based metric to quantify the functional alignment of the internal representations developed by different models. Second, we show that single-life models learn generalizable geometric representations that effectively transfer to downstream tasks, such as depth estimation, in unseen environments. Third, we demonstrate that training on up to 30 hours from one week of the same person's life leads to comparable performance to training on 30 hours of diverse web data, highlighting the strength of single-life representation learning. Overall, our results establish that the shared structure of the world, both leads to consistency in models trained on individual lives, and provides a powerful signal for visual representation learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u201c\u5355\u751f\u547d\u201d\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5373\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e2a\u4e2a\u4f53\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u9891\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5176\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u7279\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u4e0d\u540c\u4e2a\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u51e0\u4f55\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u3001\u5b66\u5230\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u5c11\u91cf\u5355\u751f\u547d\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u5ab2\u7f8e\u5927\u91cf\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u6316\u6398\u4eba\u7c7b\u65e5\u5e38\u751f\u6d3b\u4e2d\u81ea\u7136\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u7ed3\u6784\u6240\u8574\u542b\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5355\u751f\u547d\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f53\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u9891\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff1b\u5728\u5ba4\u5185/\u5ba4\u5916\u4e0d\u540c\u4e2a\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff09\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u80fd\u53ca\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "1\uff09\u4e0d\u540c\u4e2a\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7406\u89e3\uff1b2\uff09\u5355\u751f\u547d\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u5230\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u73af\u5883\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b3\uff09\u4ec5\u7528\u540c\u4e00\u4eba\u4e00\u5468\u518530\u5c0f\u65f6\u89c6\u9891\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e30\u5c0f\u65f6\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e16\u754c\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u7ed3\u6784\u4f7f\u5f97\u5355\u751f\u547d\u6570\u636e\u8db3\u4ee5\u652f\u6491\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e14\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}
