### [1] [Time-to-Move: Training-Free Motion Controlled Video Generation via Dual-Clock Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08633)
*Assaf Singer,Noam Rotstein,Amir Mann,Ron Kimmel,Or Litany*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了Time-to-Move（TTM），一种无需训练、即插即用的框架，用于在图像到视频扩散模型中实现基于粗略参考动画的运动和外观控制生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的视频生成方法在运动控制上不够精确，且依赖特定模型的微调，计算成本高且受限。因此需要一种通用、免训练的运动控制方法。

Method: 利用用户友好的操作（如拖拽或深度重投影）生成粗糙参考动画，并将其作为粗略运动线索；结合SDEdit的思想，提出双时钟去噪策略，在运动指定区域保持强对齐，在其他区域保留生成自由度，实现外观与运动的联合控制。

Result: 实验表明，TTM在物体和相机运动基准上在真实感和运动控制方面达到或超过需训练的基线方法，同时支持像素级外观控制，超越文本提示的限制。

Conclusion: TTM是一种轻量、无需训练的运动控制视频生成框架，兼容任意主干模型，平衡了用户意图保真度与自然动态，拓展了扩散模型在精细视频编辑中的能力。

Abstract: Diffusion-based video generation can create realistic videos, yet existing image- and text-based conditioning fails to offer precise motion control. Prior methods for motion-conditioned synthesis typically require model-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and restrictive. We introduce Time-to-Move (TTM), a training-free, plug-and-play framework for motion- and appearance-controlled video generation with image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models. Our key insight is to use crude reference animations obtained through user-friendly manipulations such as cut-and-drag or depth-based reprojection. Motivated by SDEdit's use of coarse layout cues for image editing, we treat the crude animations as coarse motion cues and adapt the mechanism to the video domain. We preserve appearance with image conditioning and introduce dual-clock denoising, a region-dependent strategy that enforces strong alignment in motion-specified regions while allowing flexibility elsewhere, balancing fidelity to user intent with natural dynamics. This lightweight modification of the sampling process incurs no additional training or runtime cost and is compatible with any backbone. Extensive experiments on object and camera motion benchmarks show that TTM matches or exceeds existing training-based baselines in realism and motion control. Beyond this, TTM introduces a unique capability: precise appearance control through pixel-level conditioning, exceeding the limits of text-only prompting.

### [2] [OUGS: Active View Selection via Object-aware Uncertainty Estimation in 3DGS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09397)
*Haiyi Li,Qi Chen,Denis Kalkofen,Hsiang-Ting Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为OUGS的新框架，通过基于3D高斯基元物理参数的不确定性建模，结合语义分割，实现面向对象的主动视图选择，显著提升了复杂场景中特定物体重建的效率与质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主动重建方法依赖于场景级不确定性度量，易受背景干扰，在复杂场景中难以高效重建特定物体。因此需要一种更精确、面向对象的不确定性估计方法。

Method: 提出OUGS框架，从3D高斯基元的位置、尺度和旋转等物理参数出发，通过渲染雅可比矩阵传播协方差，构建可解释的不确定性模型，并融合语义分割掩码实现对象感知的不确定性评分，指导主动视图选择。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验表明，OUGS相比现有方法能更高效地提升目标物体的重建质量，同时具备良好的全局场景不确定性估计能力。

Conclusion: OUGS通过物理驱动的不确定性建模与语义感知相结合，有效解决了复杂场景中对象级高保真重建的视图选择问题，显著提高了3DGS在对象中心任务中的效率和精度。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved state-of-the-art results for novel view synthesis. However, efficiently capturing high-fidelity reconstructions of specific objects within complex scenes remains a significant challenge. A key limitation of existing active reconstruction methods is their reliance on scene-level uncertainty metrics, which are often biased by irrelevant background clutter and lead to inefficient view selection for object-centric tasks. We present OUGS, a novel framework that addresses this challenge with a more principled, physically-grounded uncertainty formulation for 3DGS. Our core innovation is to derive uncertainty directly from the explicit physical parameters of the 3D Gaussian primitives (e.g., position, scale, rotation). By propagating the covariance of these parameters through the rendering Jacobian, we establish a highly interpretable uncertainty model. This foundation allows us to then seamlessly integrate semantic segmentation masks to produce a targeted, object-aware uncertainty score that effectively disentangles the object from its environment. This allows for a more effective active view selection strategy that prioritizes views critical to improving object fidelity. Experimental evaluations on public datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the efficiency of the 3DGS reconstruction process and achieves higher quality for targeted objects compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, while also serving as a robust uncertainty estimator for the global scene.

Abstract: The energy transition is a key theme of the last decades to determine a future of eco-sustainability, and an area of such importance cannot disregard digitization, innovation and the new technological tools available. This is the context in which the Generative Artificial Intelligence models described in this paper are positioned, developed by Engineering Ingegneria Informatica SpA in order to automate the plant structures acquisition of SNAM energy infrastructure, a leading gas transportation company in Italy and Europe. The digitization of a gas plant consists in registering all its relevant information through the interpretation of the related documentation. The aim of this work is therefore to design an effective solution based on Artificial Intelligence techniques to automate the extraction of the information necessary for the digitization of a plant, in order to streamline the daily work of MGM users. The solution received the P&ID of the plant as input, each one in pdf format, and uses OCR, Vision LLM, Object Detection, Relational Reasoning and optimization algorithms to return an output consisting of two sets of information: a structured overview of the relevant design data and the hierarchical framework of the plant. To achieve convincing results, we extend a state-of-the-art model for Scene Graph Generation introducing a brand new Transformer architecture with the aim of deepening the analysis of the complex relations between the plant's components. The synergistic use of the listed AI-based technologies allowed to overcome many obstacles arising from the high variety of data, due to the lack of standardization. An accuracy of 91\% has been achieved in the extraction of textual information relating to design data. Regarding the plants topology, 93\% of components are correctly identified and the hierarchical structure is extracted with an accuracy around 80\%.

### [4] [Assessing Identity Leakage in Talking Face Generation: Metrics and Evaluation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08613)
*Dogucan Yaman,Fevziye Irem Eyiokur,Hazım Kemal Ekenel,Alexander Waibel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种系统性评估方法来量化修复式说话人脸生成中的唇部泄露问题，包括三种测试设置和相关指标，并研究了不同身份参考选择对泄露的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 修复式说话人脸生成中存在唇部泄露问题，即生成的唇部受参考图像影响而非仅由音频驱动，而标准指标和常规测试难以检测该问题。

Method: 提出了三种互补的测试设置：静音输入生成、错配音视频配对和匹配音视频合成，并引入了唇同步差异和基于静音音频的唇同步分数等衍生指标，框架具有模型无关性。

Result: 能够有效分析和量化唇部泄露现象，揭示了不同身份参考选择对泄露程度的影响，为说话人脸生成提供了更可靠的评估基准。

Conclusion: 所提方法为修复式说话人脸生成任务提供了一个模型无关、更可靠的评估框架，有助于未来研究更准确地衡量唇部动作的真实性和一致性。

Abstract: Inpainting-based talking face generation aims to preserve video details such as pose, lighting, and gestures while modifying only lip motion, often using an identity reference image to maintain speaker consistency. However, this mechanism can introduce lip leaking, where generated lips are influenced by the reference image rather than solely by the driving audio. Such leakage is difficult to detect with standard metrics and conventional test setup. To address this, we propose a systematic evaluation methodology to analyze and quantify lip leakage. Our framework employs three complementary test setups: silent-input generation, mismatched audio-video pairing, and matched audio-video synthesis. We also introduce derived metrics including lip-sync discrepancy and silent-audio-based lip-sync scores. In addition, we study how different identity reference selections affect leakage, providing insights into reference design. The proposed methodology is model-agnostic and establishes a more reliable benchmark for future research in talking face generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了MATRIX，一个包含八架无人机同步拍摄的复杂城市环境下的多视角行人跟踪数据集及相应的深度学习框架，解决了动态摄像头位置和复杂遮挡下的检测与跟踪难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理动态摄像头位置和复杂遮挡时表现不佳，且缺乏真实多无人机协同监控场景的数据集支持。

Method: 提出了一种结合实时相机校准、基于特征的图像配准和鸟瞰图（BEV）多视角特征融合的深度学习框架，并构建了包含40名行人的MATRIX数据集用于训练与评估。

Result: 实验表明，传统静态摄像头方法在复杂环境下性能显著下降，而本文方法在挑战性条件下仍保持约90%的检测与跟踪精度，并成功跟踪约80%的轨迹；预训练模型展现出良好的泛化能力，且系统对相机失效具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MATRIX数据集和所提框架为动态多视角监控系统提供了重要基准，推动了多无人机 surveillance 系统的发展。

Abstract: Multi-drone surveillance systems offer enhanced coverage and robustness for pedestrian tracking, yet existing approaches struggle with dynamic camera positions and complex occlusions. This paper introduces MATRIX (Multi-Aerial TRacking In compleX environments), a comprehensive dataset featuring synchronized footage from eight drones with continuously changing positions, and a novel deep learning framework for multi-view detection and tracking. Unlike existing datasets that rely on static cameras or limited drone coverage, MATRIX provides a challenging scenario with 40 pedestrians and a significant architectural obstruction in an urban environment. Our framework addresses the unique challenges of dynamic drone-based surveillance through real-time camera calibration, feature-based image registration, and multi-view feature fusion in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation. Experimental results demonstrate that while static camera methods maintain over 90\% detection and tracking precision and accuracy metrics in a simplified MATRIX environment without an obstruction, 10 pedestrians and a much smaller observational area, their performance significantly degrades in the complex environment. Our proposed approach maintains robust performance with $\sim$90\% detection and tracking accuracy, as well as successfully tracks $\sim$80\% of trajectories under challenging conditions. Transfer learning experiments reveal strong generalization capabilities, with the pretrained model achieving much higher detection and tracking accuracy performance compared to training the model from scratch. Additionally, systematic camera dropout experiments reveal graceful performance degradation, demonstrating practical robustness for real-world deployments where camera failures may occur. The MATRIX dataset and framework provide essential benchmarks for advancing dynamic multi-view surveillance systems.

### [6] [Learning Topology-Driven Multi-Subspace Fusion for Grassmannian Deep Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08628)
*Xuan Yu,Tianyang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

Conclusion: 该工作推动了几何深度学习的发展，成功将欧氏空间多通道交互思想迁移到非欧域，实现了更强的判别性和可解释性。

Abstract: Grassmannian manifold offers a powerful carrier for geometric representation learning by modelling high-dimensional data as low-dimensional subspaces. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on static single-subspace representations, neglecting the dynamic interplay between multiple subspaces critical for capturing complex geometric structures. To address this limitation, we propose a topology-driven multi-subspace fusion framework that enables adaptive subspace collaboration on the Grassmannian. Our solution introduces two key innovations: (1) Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, an adaptive multi-subspace modelling mechanism is proposed that dynamically selects and weights task-relevant subspaces via topological convergence analysis, and (2) a multi-subspace interaction block that fuses heterogeneous geometric representations through Fréchet mean optimisation on the manifold. Theoretically, we establish the convergence guarantees of adaptive subspaces under a projection metric topology, ensuring stable gradient-based optimisation. Practically, we integrate Riemannian batch normalisation and mutual information regularisation to enhance discriminability and robustness. Extensive experiments on 3D action recognition (HDM05, FPHA), EEG classification (MAMEM-SSVEPII), and graph tasks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Our work not only advances geometric deep learning but also successfully adapts the proven multi-channel interaction philosophy of Euclidean networks to non-Euclidean domains, achieving superior discriminability and interpretability.

### [7] [CADIC: Continual Anomaly Detection Based on Incremental Coreset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08634)
*Gen Yang,Zhipeng Deng,Junfeng Man*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种新的持续异常检测（CAD）框架，通过共享统一内存库和固定大小的coreset增量更新嵌入，避免任务特定内存碎片，实现最先进的检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于嵌入的CAD方法需要为每个任务构建类特定的子内存库，限制了灵活性和可扩展性，且易发生灾难性遗忘。

Method: 所有任务共享一个统一的内存库，在训练中通过固定大小的coreset增量更新嵌入；推理阶段使用最近邻匹配机制计算异常分数。

Result: 在MVTec AD和Visa数据集上达到0.972和0.891的平均图像级AUROC，优于现有基线；在真实电子纸数据集上实现100%异常检测准确率。

Conclusion: 所提方法具有良好的连续学习能力、高检测精度和实际应用鲁棒性，提升了CAD的灵活性与可扩展性。

Abstract: The primary objective of Continual Anomaly Detection (CAD) is to learn the normal patterns of new tasks under dynamic data distribution assumptions while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Existing embedding-based CAD approaches continuously update a memory bank with new embeddings to adapt to sequential tasks. However, these methods require constructing class-specific sub-memory banks for each task, which restricts their flexibility and scalability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel CAD framework where all tasks share a unified memory bank. During training, the method incrementally updates embeddings within a fixed-size coreset, enabling continuous knowledge acquisition from sequential tasks without task-specific memory fragmentation. In the inference phase, anomaly scores are computed via a nearest-neighbor matching mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art detection accuracy. We validate the method through comprehensive experiments on MVTec AD and Visa datasets. Results show that our approach outperforms existing baselines, achieving average image-level AUROC scores of 0.972 (MVTec AD) and 0.891 (Visa). Notably, on a real-world electronic paper dataset, it demonstrates 100% accuracy in anomaly sample detection, confirming its robustness in practical scenarios. The implementation will be open-sourced on GitHub.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种结合扩散去噪与时间感知演员-评论家模型的统一框架，用于在传感器噪声和延迟下实现可靠且及时的事故预判。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶中事故预判至关重要，但实际部署面临传感器输入噪声和预测时效性与可靠性平衡的挑战。

Method: 采用基于扩散的去噪模块来增强图像和对象特征，同时使用时间感知的演员-评论家模型进行长时序推理和优化预警时机。

Result: 在DAD、CCD和A3D三个数据集上达到最优性能，显著提升事故前平均预警时间，并在高斯和脉冲噪声下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效提升复杂交通场景下的早期、稳定且符合人类直觉的事故预警能力，具备实际安全应用潜力。

Abstract: Accident anticipation is essential for proactive and safe autonomous driving, where even a brief advance warning can enable critical evasive actions. However, two key challenges hinder real-world deployment: (1) noisy or degraded sensory inputs from weather, motion blur, or hardware limitations, and (2) the need to issue timely yet reliable predictions that balance early alerts with false-alarm suppression. We propose a unified framework that integrates diffusion-based denoising with a time-aware actor-critic model to address these challenges. The diffusion module reconstructs noise-resilient image and object features through iterative refinement, preserving critical motion and interaction cues under sensor degradation. In parallel, the actor-critic architecture leverages long-horizon temporal reasoning and time-weighted rewards to determine the optimal moment to raise an alert, aligning early detection with reliability. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (DAD, CCD, A3D) demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy and significant gains in mean time-to-accident, while maintaining robust performance under Gaussian and impulse noise. Qualitative analyses further show that our model produces earlier, more stable, and human-aligned predictions in both routine and highly complex traffic scenarios, highlighting its potential for real-world, safety-critical deployment.

### [9] [RS-Net: Context-Aware Relation Scoring for Dynamic Scene Graph Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08651)
*Hae-Won Jo,Yeong-Jun Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种模块化框架RS-Net，用于动态场景图生成（DSGG），通过空间和时间上下文对物体对的关系重要性进行评分，提升了关系预测的准确性和召回率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DSGG方法仅在标注的相关物体对上训练，缺乏对非相关物体对的指导，导致推理时难以识别有意义的关系。

Method: 设计了包含空间上下文编码器（带可学习上下文令牌）和时间编码器的RS-Net，聚合视频级信息，并将关系得分融入统一的三元组评分机制中，可无缝集成到现有模型。

Result: 在Action Genome数据集上实验表明，RS-Net在多种基线上均提升了Recall和Precision，尤其在平均Recall上有显著提升，有效应对关系的长尾分布问题。

Conclusion: RS-Net能有效增强DSGG中的关系预测性能，兼顾效率与效果，优于当前最先进方法。

Abstract: Dynamic Scene Graph Generation (DSGG) models how object relations evolve over time in videos. However, existing methods are trained only on annotated object pairs and lack guidance for non-related pairs, making it difficult to identify meaningful relations during inference. In this paper, we propose Relation Scoring Network (RS-Net), a modular framework that scores the contextual importance of object pairs using both spatial interactions and long-range temporal context. RS-Net consists of a spatial context encoder with learnable context tokens and a temporal encoder that aggregates video-level information. The resulting relation scores are integrated into a unified triplet scoring mechanism to enhance relation prediction. RS-Net can be easily integrated into existing DSGG models without architectural changes. Experiments on the Action Genome dataset show that RS-Net consistently improves both Recall and Precision across diverse baselines, with notable gains in mean Recall, highlighting its ability to address the long-tailed distribution of relations. Despite the increased number of parameters, RS-Net maintains competitive efficiency, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

### [10] [Privacy Beyond Pixels: Latent Anonymization for Privacy-Preserving Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08666)
*Joseph Fioresi,Ishan Rajendrakumar Dave,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种在潜在空间中进行视觉隐私保护的新方法，通过轻量级的匿名适配器模块（AAM）去除视频特征中的敏感信息，同时保持下游任务性能，有效减少35%的隐私泄露，并缓解动作识别中的性别偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐私保护方法多集中在像素级别，需重新训练模型且难以泛化到基础模型；而视频基础模型提取的时空特征虽增强理解能力，但也容易泄露个人敏感信息，因此需要一种无需重训练、可插拔且兼顾隐私与效用的解决方案。

Method: 提出一种轻量级的匿名适配器模块（AAM），以即插即用方式应用于冻结的视频编码器，在潜在空间中去除敏感信息；设计三个新的训练目标：基于静态片段的自监督隐私目标、协同训练以保留已见任务效用、潜在一致性损失以提升未见任务泛化能力。

Result: 在多个下游任务（动作识别、时序动作检测、异常检测）上实现接近基线性能的同时，隐私泄露减少35%；能有效匿名化敏感时间属性，并减轻动作识别中的性别偏见。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效、可扩展的视频基础模型隐私保护方案，平衡了隐私保护与任务通用性，推动更公平和安全的视频理解技术发展。

Abstract: We introduce a novel formulation of visual privacy preservation for video foundation models that operates entirely in the latent space. While spatio-temporal features learned by foundation models have deepened general understanding of video content, sharing or storing these extracted visual features for downstream tasks inadvertently reveals sensitive personal information like skin color, gender, or clothing. Current privacy preservation methods focus on input-pixel-level anonymization, which requires retraining the entire utility video model and results in task-specific anonymization, making them unsuitable for recent video foundational models. To address these challenges, we introduce a lightweight Anonymizing Adapter Module (AAM) that removes private information from video features while retaining general task utility. AAM can be applied in a plug-and-play fashion to frozen video encoders, minimizing the computational burden of finetuning and re-extracting features. Our framework employs three newly designed training objectives: (1) a clip-level self-supervised privacy objective to reduce mutual information between static clips, (2) a co-training objective to retain utility across seen tasks, and (3) a latent consistency loss for generalization on unseen tasks. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate a significant 35% reduction in privacy leakage while maintaining near-baseline utility performance across various downstream tasks: Action Recognition (Kinetics400, UCF101, HMDB51), Temporal Action Detection (THUMOS14), and Anomaly Detection (UCF-Crime). We also provide an analysis on anonymization for sensitive temporal attribute recognition. Additionally, we propose new protocols for assessing gender bias in action recognition models, showing that our method effectively mitigates such biases and promotes more equitable video understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了自回归逐像素预测在统一视觉模型中的扩展特性，发现不同任务（如图像分类与生成）的最优扩展策略存在差异，且随着分辨率提升，模型规模需比数据量增长更快；研究指出计算资源是主要瓶颈，并预测未来五年内逐像素图像建模将可行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索简单且端到端的自回归逐像素预测框架在统一视觉模型中的扩展规律，填补该方向研究空白。

Method: 使用IsoFlops配置，在32x32分辨率图像上训练一系列Transformer模型，覆盖最高达7e19 FLOPs的计算预算，并评估其在像素预测、ImageNet分类和生成质量（Frechet Distance）三个指标上的表现。

Result: 发现图像分类与生成的最优扩展策略不同：生成任务需要数据量增长比分类快3-5倍；随着分辨率提高，模型规模需远快于数据量扩展；计算资源被识别为主要瓶颈。

Conclusion: 自回归逐像素预测具有可扩展性，但最优策略因任务而异；未来计算能力的持续增长将使高分辨率逐像素图像建模成为可能。

Abstract: This paper investigates the scaling properties of autoregressive next-pixel prediction, a simple, end-to-end yet under-explored framework for unified vision models. Starting with images at resolutions of 32x32, we train a family of Transformers using IsoFlops profiles across compute budgets up to 7e19 FLOPs and evaluate three distinct target metrics: next-pixel prediction objective, ImageNet classification accuracy, and generation quality measured by Fr'echet Distance. First, optimal scaling strategy is critically task-dependent. At a fixed 32x32 resolution alone, the optimal scaling properties for image classification and image generation diverge, where generation optimal setup requires the data size grow three to five times faster than for the classification optimal setup. Second, as image resolution increases, the optimal scaling strategy indicates that the model size must grow much faster than data size. Surprisingly, by projecting our findings, we discover that the primary bottleneck is compute rather than the amount of training data. As compute continues to grow four to five times annually, we forecast the feasibility of pixel-by-pixel modeling of images within the next five years.

*Abhipsa Basu,Aviral Gupta,Abhijnya Bhat,R. Venkatesh Babu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究探索了使用LoRA和DreamBooth等扩散模型微调技术生成更准确的图像数据，以缓解图像分类中的群体偏差问题，并在多个基准上表现优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像分类系统常因训练数据中群体表示不均而继承偏见，例如发色分类中金发与女性的过度关联，需要有效的方法来消除此类偏见。

Method: 采用LoRA和DreamBooth对Stable Diffusion进行微调，通过聚类组内图像并为每个聚类训练独立的DreamBooth模型，生成平衡的训练数据，用于预训练后再在真实数据上微调。

Result: 实验表明，所提出的方法平均优于原始Stable Diffusion，在多个基准上性能与SOTA去偏方法（如Group-DRO）相当，并在数据集偏差严重时表现更优。

Conclusion: 基于扩散模型的微调技术能有效生成保持原始分布的平衡数据，是缓解图像分类中数据偏差的有前景方法。

Abstract: Image classification systems often inherit biases from uneven group representation in training data. For example, in face datasets for hair color classification, blond hair may be disproportionately associated with females, reinforcing stereotypes. A recent approach leverages the Stable Diffusion model to generate balanced training data, but these models often struggle to preserve the original data distribution. In this work, we explore multiple diffusion-finetuning techniques, e.g., LoRA and DreamBooth, to generate images that more accurately represent each training group by learning directly from their samples. Additionally, in order to prevent a single DreamBooth model from being overwhelmed by excessive intra-group variations, we explore a technique of clustering images within each group and train a DreamBooth model per cluster. These models are then used to generate group-balanced data for pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the studied finetuning approaches outperform vanilla Stable Diffusion on average and achieve results comparable to SOTA debiasing techniques like Group-DRO, while surpassing them as the dataset bias severity increases.

### [14] [Adaptive graph Kolmogorov-Arnold network for 3D human pose estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08809)
*Abu Taib Mohammed Shahjahan,A. Ben Hamza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于自适应图Kolmogorov-Arnold网络（PoseKAN）的2D到3D人体姿态估计方法，通过可学习边函数和多跳特征聚合克服了传统GCN在长距离依赖和高频细节建模上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GCN方法因局部感受野和频谱偏差问题，在处理遮挡和深度模糊时难以捕捉长距离依赖和高频率细节。

Method: 提出PoseKAN，采用可学习的边函数替代固定激活函数，引入多跳特征聚合、残差PoseKAN模块和全局响应归一化，增强模型表达力与空间感知能力。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实验表明，该方法在2D-to-3D姿态提升任务中表现出与当前最先进方法相当甚至更优的性能。

Conclusion: PoseKAN通过可学习的图结构函数和改进的特征聚合机制，有效提升了3D人体姿态估计的精度与鲁棒性，尤其在复杂场景下表现突出。

Abstract: Graph convolutional network (GCN)-based methods have shown strong performance in 3D human pose estimation by leveraging the natural graph structure of the human skeleton. However, their local receptive field limits their ability to capture long-range dependencies essential for handling occlusions and depth ambiguities. They also exhibit spectral bias, which prioritizes low-frequency components while struggling to model high-frequency details. In this paper, we introduce PoseKAN, an adaptive graph Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), framework that extends KANs to graph-based learning for 2D-to-3D pose lifting from a single image. Unlike GCNs that use fixed activation functions, KANs employ learnable functions on graph edges, allowing data-driven, adaptive feature transformations. This enhances the model's adaptability and expressiveness, making it more expressive in learning complex pose variations. Our model employs multi-hop feature aggregation, ensuring the body joints can leverage information from both local and distant neighbors, leading to improved spatial awareness. It also incorporates residual PoseKAN blocks for deeper feature refinement, and a global response normalization for improved feature selectivity and contrast. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our model against state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代深度视觉模型依赖于对微小扰动敏感的像素级表示，易受对抗攻击，现有防御方法缺乏引入本征鲁棒特征的机制。

Method: 将SIFT关键点与图注意力网络结合，提取具有尺度和旋转不变性的局部结构特征，并将其融合到Vision Transformer和CNN等传统视觉模型中，构建统一的结构感知防御模型。

Result: 在梯度白盒对抗攻击下显著提升了模型鲁棒性，同时保持了较高的干净样本准确率。

Conclusion: SIFT-Graph通过融合手工特征与深度学习模型，提供了一种有效且结构感知的对抗防御新范式。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks expose a fundamental vulnerability in modern deep vision models by exploiting their dependence on dense, pixel-level representations that are highly sensitive to imperceptible perturbations. Traditional defense strategies typically operate within this fragile pixel domain, lacking mechanisms to incorporate inherently robust visual features. In this work, we introduce SIFT-Graph, a multimodal defense framework that enhances the robustness of traditional vision models by aggregating structurally meaningful features extracted from raw images using both handcrafted and learned modalities. Specifically, we integrate Scale-Invariant Feature Transform keypoints with a Graph Attention Network to capture scale and rotation invariant local structures that are resilient to perturbations. These robust feature embeddings are then fused with traditional vision model, such as Vision Transformer and Convolutional Neural Network, to form a unified, structure-aware and perturbation defensive model. Preliminary results demonstrate that our method effectively improves the visual model robustness against gradient-based white box adversarial attacks, while incurring only a marginal drop in clean accuracy.

### [16] [DT-NVS: Diffusion Transformers for Novel View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08823)
*Wonbong Jang,Jonathan Tremblay,Lourdes Agapito*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的3D感知扩散模型DT-NVS，用于从单张图像生成真实场景的新视角，解决了现有方法在小范围相机移动或非自然场景中的局限性。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于扩散的方法主要集中在小范围相机运动或非自然的物体中心场景，限制了其在现实世界中的应用。因此，需要一种能够处理大规模、多类别、未对齐的真实日常场景视频的通用新视角合成方法。

Method: 提出DT-NVS，一种基于Transformer架构的3D感知扩散模型，采用仅图像损失进行训练，并引入新的相机条件策略和训练范式，交换参考帧与噪声输入的角色，以适应真实世界未对齐的数据集。

Result: 在广义新视角合成任务上，DT-NVS优于现有的3D感知扩散模型和确定性方法，能够生成多样化且高质量的新视角图像。

Abstract: Generating novel views of a natural scene, e.g., every-day scenes both indoors and outdoors, from a single view is an under-explored problem, even though it is an organic extension to the object-centric novel view synthesis. Existing diffusion-based approaches focus rather on small camera movements in real scenes or only consider unnatural object-centric scenes, limiting their potential applications in real-world settings. In this paper we move away from these constrained regimes and propose a 3D diffusion model trained with image-only losses on a large-scale dataset of real-world, multi-category, unaligned, and casually acquired videos of everyday scenes. We propose DT-NVS, a 3D-aware diffusion model for generalized novel view synthesis that exploits a transformer-based architecture backbone. We make significant contributions to transformer and self-attention architectures to translate images to 3d representations, and novel camera conditioning strategies to allow training on real-world unaligned datasets. In addition, we introduce a novel training paradigm swapping the role of reference frame between the conditioning image and the sampled noisy input. We evaluate our approach on the 3D task of generalized novel view synthesis from a single input image and show improvements over state-of-the-art 3D aware diffusion models and deterministic approaches, while generating diverse outputs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的旋转不变性学习方法SiPF和RIAttnConv，通过引入全局一致的参考点（shadow）来解决3D点云中对称部件难以区分的问题，在保持旋转不变性的同时增强了全局姿态感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有旋转不变性方法因感受野受限导致翼尖特征坍缩，无法区分几何相似但空间位置不同的结构，丢失了全局姿态信息。

Method: 提出Shadow-informed Pose Feature (SiPF)，利用学习到的共享旋转生成全局参考点（shadow），增强局部描述符；设计RIAttnConv注意力机制融合SiPF进行特征聚合，并基于Bingham分布动态学习最优全局旋转以定位shadow。

Result: 在3D分类和部件分割任务上显著优于现有旋转不变性方法，尤其在需要细粒度空间判别的任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了旋转不变性学习中的特征坍缩问题，在保持旋转鲁棒性的同时恢复了对全局姿态的感知能力，提升了模型对对称结构的辨别力。

Abstract: Recent advances in rotation-invariant (RI) learning for 3D point clouds typically replace raw coordinates with handcrafted RI features to ensure robustness under arbitrary rotations. However, these approaches often suffer from the loss of global pose information, making them incapable of distinguishing geometrically similar but spatially distinct structures. We identify that this limitation stems from the restricted receptive field in existing RI methods, leading to Wing-tip feature collapse, a failure to differentiate symmetric components (e.g., left and right airplane wings) due to indistinguishable local geometries. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the Shadow-informed Pose Feature (SiPF), which augments local RI descriptors with a globally consistent reference point (referred to as the 'shadow') derived from a learned shared rotation. This mechanism enables the model to preserve global pose awareness while maintaining rotation invariance. We further propose Rotation-invariant Attention Convolution (RIAttnConv), an attention-based operator that integrates SiPFs into the feature aggregation process, thereby enhancing the model's capacity to distinguish structurally similar components. Additionally, we design a task-adaptive shadow locating module based on the Bingham distribution over unit quaternions, which dynamically learns the optimal global rotation for constructing consistent shadows. Extensive experiments on 3D classification and part segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms existing RI methods, particularly in tasks requiring fine-grained spatial discrimination under arbitrary rotations.

### [18] [SasMamba: A Lightweight Structure-Aware Stride State Space Model for 3D Human Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08872)
*Hu Cui,Wenqiang Hua,Renjing Huang,Shurui Jia,Tessai Hayama*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于骨架结构感知的步幅状态空间模型（SAS-SSM），用于3D人体姿态估计，有效保留空间结构并建模时空依赖，在减少参数量的同时实现竞争性性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于SSM的方法通过手动设计的扫描操作将2D姿态序列展平为纯时序序列，破坏了人体姿态的固有空间结构，导致难以捕捉复杂的姿态依赖关系。

Method: 提出SAS-SSM，首先使用结构感知的时空卷积动态捕获关节间的局部交互，再采用基于步幅的扫描策略构建多尺度全局结构表示，从而在保持线性计算复杂度的同时灵活建模局部和全局姿态信息。

Result: 基于SAS-SSM的模型SasMamba在3D姿态估计任务中表现出竞争性性能，并显著减少了模型参数量。

Conclusion: SAS-SSM有效解决了传统SSM方法在3D姿态估计中破坏空间结构的问题，兼顾效率与精度，为轻量化姿态估计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recently, the Mamba architecture based on State Space Models (SSMs) has gained attention in 3D human pose estimation due to its linear complexity and strong global modeling capability. However, existing SSM-based methods typically apply manually designed scan operations to flatten detected 2D pose sequences into purely temporal sequences, either locally or globally. This approach disrupts the inherent spatial structure of human poses and entangles spatial and temporal features, making it difficult to capture complex pose dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose the Skeleton Structure-Aware Stride SSM (SAS-SSM), which first employs a structure-aware spatiotemporal convolution to dynamically capture essential local interactions between joints, and then applies a stride-based scan strategy to construct multi-scale global structural representations. This enables flexible modeling of both local and global pose information while maintaining linear computational complexity. Built upon SAS-SSM, our model SasMamba achieves competitive 3D pose estimation performance with significantly fewer parameters compared to existing hybrid models.

*Cheng Wang,Shuisheng Zhou,Fengjiao Peng,Jin Sheng,Feng Ye,Yinli Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于Vision Transformer的多融合增强ViT块（MFAVBs），通过显式融合正样本对特征提升图像聚类性能，在七个数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比学习网络隐式交互限制了正样本对互补性和相似性的充分利用，难以充分提取聚类特征。

Method: 设计MFAVBs结构，使用共享权重ViT处理增广正样本，融合输出特征后输入更大ViT；将学习到的特征拆分为新的增广正样本送入下一级FAVB，实现多次融合与增强；结合CLIP预提取特征，并在实例级和聚类级空间联合优化交叉熵损失。

Result: 在七个公开数据集上的实验表明，所提方法在聚类性能上优于当前最先进的技术。

Conclusion: MFAVBs能有效显式融合正样本特征，显著提升对比聚类效果，结合CLIP特征进一步增强了模型对相似图像的区分能力。

Abstract: In the field of image clustering, the widely used contrastive learning networks improve clustering performance by maximizing the similarity between positive pairs and the dissimilarity of negative pairs of the inputs. Extant contrastive learning networks, whose two encoders often implicitly interact with each other by parameter sharing or momentum updating, may not fully exploit the complementarity and similarity of the positive pairs to extract clustering features from input data. To explicitly fuse the learned features of positive pairs, we design a novel multiple fusing-augmenting ViT blocks (MFAVBs) based on the excellent feature learning ability of Vision Transformers (ViT). Firstly, two preprocessed augmentions as positive pairs are separately fed into two shared-weight ViTs, then their output features are fused to input into a larger ViT. Secondly, the learned features are split into a pair of new augmented positive samples and passed to the next FAVBs, enabling multiple fusion and augmention through MFAVBs operations. Finally, the learned features are projected into both instance-level and clustering-level spaces to calculate the cross-entropy loss, followed by parameter updates by backpropagation to finalize the training process. To further enhance ability of the model to distinguish between similar images, our input data for the network we propose is preprocessed augmentions with features extracted from the CLIP pretrained model. Our experiments on seven public datasets demonstrate that MFAVBs serving as the backbone for contrastive clustering outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques in terms of clustering performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于胶质母细胞瘤预后差且缺乏显著治疗进展，亟需通过自动化方法深入理解其组织形态学特征，以提升大规模病理分析的准确性与一致性。

Method: 采用EfficientNet系列模型（B0-B4）对H&E染色的GBM组织切片进行六类组织区域分类，通过五折交叉验证优化模型，并在训练、验证和测试集上评估F1分数。

Result: 在训练集上，EfficientNet-B1和B4取得0.98的F1分数，但在独立验证集和隐藏测试集上分别降至0.546和0.517，显示出模型泛化能力的挑战。

Conclusion: 尽管模型在训练数据上表现优异，但跨数据集性能下降表明，临床应用中实现良好泛化仍具挑战，需进一步优化以适应真实世界数据。

Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common aggressive, fast-growing brain tumor, with a grim prognosis. Despite clinical diagnostic advancements, there have not been any substantial improvements to patient prognosis. Histopathological assessment of excised tumors is the first line of clinical diagnostic routine. We hypothesize that automated, robust, and accurate identification of distinct histological sub-regions within GBM could contribute to morphologically understanding this disease at scale. In this study, we designed a four-step deep learning approach to classify six (6) histopathological regions and quantitatively evaluated it on the BraTS-Path 2024 challenge dataset, which includes digitized Hematoxylin \& Eosin (H\&E) stained GBM tissue sections annotated for six distinct regions. We used the challenge's publicly available training dataset to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of several variants of EfficientNet architectures (i.e., B0, B1, B2, B3, B4). EfficientNet-B1 and EfficientNet-B4 achieved the best performance, achieving an F1 score of 0.98 in a 5-fold cross-validation configuration using the BraTS-Path training set. The quantitative performance evaluation of our proposed approach with EfficientNet-B1 on the BraTS-Path hold-out validation data and the final hidden testing data yielded F1 scores of 0.546 and 0.517, respectively, for the associated 6-class classification task. The difference in the performance on training, validation, and testing data highlights the challenge of developing models that generalize well to new data, which is crucial for clinical applications. The source code of the proposed approach can be found at the GitHub repository of Indiana University Division of Computational Pathology: https://github.com/IUCompPath/brats-path-2024-enet.

Abstract: Object recognition plays a fundamental role in how biological organisms perceive and interact with their environment. While the human visual system performs this task with remarkable efficiency, reproducing similar capabilities in artificial systems remains challenging. This study investigates VisNet, a biologically inspired neural network model, and several enhanced variants incorporating radial basis function neurons, Mahalanobis distance based learning, and retinal like preprocessing for both general object recognition and symmetry classification. By leveraging principles of Hebbian learning and temporal continuity associating temporally adjacent views to build invariant representations. VisNet and its extensions capture robust and transformation invariant features. Experimental results across multiple datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR10, and custom symmetric object sets, show that these enhanced VisNet variants substantially improve recognition accuracy compared with the baseline model. These findings underscore the adaptability and biological relevance of VisNet inspired architectures, offering a powerful and interpretable framework for visual recognition in both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的跨模态知识蒸馏方法ACKD，用于处理弱语义一致性下的模态间知识迁移，并设计了SemBridge框架以降低传输成本，在遥感场景分类任务中表现出优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于实际场景中成对模态数据稀缺，传统对称跨模态知识蒸馏（SCKD）受限，因此研究在弱语义一致性下的通用知识学习方法。

Method: 提出Asymmetric Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation（ACKD），并构建SemBridge框架，包含学生友好的匹配模块（基于自监督学习动态选择教师样本）和语义感知知识对齐模块（利用拉格朗日优化求解最优传输路径）。

Result: 在多个数据集和6种模型架构上验证了所提方法的有效性，性能优于7种现有方法，实现了最先进水平。

Conclusion: ACKD为弱语义关联的跨模态知识迁移提供了有效解决方案，SemBridge通过动态样本匹配与优化传输路径显著降低了知识传输成本。

Abstract: Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation has demonstrated promising performance on paired modalities with strong semantic connections, referred to as Symmetric Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (SCKD). However, implementing SCKD becomes exceedingly constrained in real-world scenarios due to the limited availability of paired modalities. To this end, we investigate a general and effective knowledge learning concept under weak semantic consistency, dubbed Asymmetric Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (ACKD), aiming to bridge modalities with limited semantic overlap. Nevertheless, the shift from strong to weak semantic consistency improves flexibility but exacerbates challenges in knowledge transmission costs, which we rigorously verified based on optimal transport theory. To mitigate the issue, we further propose a framework, namely SemBridge, integrating a Student-Friendly Matching module and a Semantic-aware Knowledge Alignment module. The former leverages self-supervised learning to acquire semantic-based knowledge and provide personalized instruction for each student sample by dynamically selecting the relevant teacher samples. The latter seeks the optimal transport path by employing Lagrangian optimization. To facilitate the research, we curate a benchmark dataset derived from two modalities, namely Multi-Spectral (MS) and asymmetric RGB images, tailored for remote sensing scene classification. Comprehensive experiments exhibit that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with 7 existing approaches on 6 different model architectures across various datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种融合视觉预测与文本预训练大语言模型结构先验的半监督文档布局理解框架，通过逆方差融合生成高质量伪标签，在少量标注数据下显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文档布局理解方法仍严重依赖大量标注数据，尽管有半监督学习进展，但性能提升有限，需探索如何有效利用未标注数据并引入外部知识（如LLM）来增强模型。

Method: 构建OCR-LLM流水线推断文档层级结构，结合教师模型输出，通过基于逆方差的加权融合策略生成优化的伪标签；引入实例自适应门控机制动态调整权重，并利用开放源代码LLM实现隐私保护部署。

Result: 在仅使用5%标签的PubLayNet上，轻量级SwiftFormer达到88.2 AP，LayoutLMv3达到89.7 AP，优于标准半监督方法并媲美需大规模预训练的UDOP；LLM提供语义消歧（+3.8 AP）、自适应门控提升0.9 AP，开源LLM部署损失小。

Conclusion: LLM的结构先验可有效补充视觉检测器，适用于不同规模模型，能显著降低对标注数据的依赖，为高效、隐私友好的文档理解提供新路径。

Abstract: Document layout understanding remains data-intensive despite advances in semi-supervised learning. We present a framework that enhances semi-supervised detection by fusing visual predictions with structural priors from text-pretrained LLMs via principled probabilistic weighting. Given unlabeled documents, an OCR-LLM pipeline infers hierarchical regions which are combined with teacher detector outputs through inverse-variance fusion to generate refined pseudo-labels.Our method demonstrates consistent gains across model scales. With a lightweight SwiftFormer backbone (26M params), we achieve 88.2$\pm$0.3 AP using only 5\% labels on PubLayNet. When applied to document-pretrained LayoutLMv3 (133M params), our fusion framework reaches 89.7$\pm$0.4 AP, surpassing both LayoutLMv3 with standard semi-supervised learning (89.1$\pm$0.4 AP, p=0.02) and matching UDOP~\cite{udop} (89.8 AP) which requires 100M+ pages of multimodal pretraining. This demonstrates that LLM structural priors are complementary to both lightweight and pretrained architectures. Key findings include: (1) learned instance-adaptive gating improves over fixed weights by +0.9 AP with data-dependent PAC bounds correctly predicting convergence; (2) open-source LLMs enable privacy-preserving deployment with minimal loss (Llama-3-70B: 87.1 AP lightweight, 89.4 AP with LayoutLMv3); (3) LLMs provide targeted semantic disambiguation (18.7\% of cases, +3.8 AP gain) beyond simple text heuristics.Total system cost includes \$12 for GPT-4o-mini API or 17 GPU-hours for local Llama-3-70B per 50K pages, amortized across training runs.

Abstract: Unsupervised remote sensing change detection aims to monitor and analyze changes from multi-temporal remote sensing images in the same geometric region at different times, without the need for labeled training data. Previous unsupervised methods attempt to achieve style transfer across multi-temporal remote sensing images through reconstruction by a generator network, and then capture the unreconstructable areas as the changed regions. However, it often leads to poor performance due to generator overfitting. In this paper, we propose a novel Consistency Change Detection Framework (CCDF) to address this challenge. Specifically, we introduce a Cycle Consistency (CC) module to reduce the overfitting issues in the generator-based reconstruction. Additionally, we propose a Semantic Consistency (SC) module to enable detail reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches.

TL;DR: HitoMi-Cam是一种基于光谱反射特性的轻量级、形状无关的人员检测方法，可在资源受限的边缘设备上实现实时运行，在搜索救援等形状不可预测的场景中表现优于传统CNN模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于卷积神经网络（CNN）的目标检测方法对训练数据中未包含的姿态和形状敏感，导致在实际应用（如灾难救援）中性能下降。因此需要一种不依赖形状的检测方法。

Method: 提出HitoMi-Cam，利用衣物的光谱反射特性进行人员检测，并在无GPU的边缘设备上实现和评估该系统，以验证其在资源受限条件下的可行性。

Result: 系统实现了23.2 fps的处理速度（253x190像素），满足实时性要求；在模拟搜救场景中，平均精度（AP）达到93.5%，显著高于最佳CNN模型的53.8%，且误报率极低。

Conclusion: HitoMi-Cam并非旨在取代CNN检测器，而是在形状变化多端或不可预测的实际环境中（如灾害救援）作为CNN的有力补充，证明了光谱方法在边缘设备上用于实时人员检测的可行性与优势。

Abstract: While convolutional neural network (CNN)-based object detection is widely used, it exhibits a shape dependency that degrades performance for postures not included in the training data. Building upon our previous simulation study published in this journal, this study implements and evaluates the spectral-based approach on physical hardware to address this limitation. Specifically, this paper introduces HitoMi-Cam, a lightweight and shape-agnostic person detection method that uses the spectral reflectance properties of clothing. The author implemented the system on a resource-constrained edge device without a GPU to assess its practical viability. The results indicate that a processing speed of 23.2 frames per second (fps) (253x190 pixels) is achievable, suggesting that the method can be used for real-time applications. In a simulated search and rescue scenario where the performance of CNNs declines, HitoMi-Cam achieved an average precision (AP) of 93.5%, surpassing that of the compared CNN models (best AP of 53.8%). Throughout all evaluation scenarios, the occurrence of false positives remained minimal. This study positions the HitoMi-Cam method not as a replacement for CNN-based detectors but as a complementary tool under specific conditions. The results indicate that spectral-based person detection can be a viable option for real-time operation on edge devices in real-world environments where shapes are unpredictable, such as disaster rescue.

### [26] [Negative Entity Suppression for Zero-Shot Captioning with Synthetic Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08909)
*Zimao Lu,Hui Xu,Bing Liu,Ke Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Negative Entity Suppression (NES)的方法，用于缓解零样本图像描述生成中的跨域幻觉问题，通过合成图像、过滤负实体和注意力级抑制来提升生成准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于文本训练的零样本图像描述方法在跨域场景下泛化能力差，容易产生幻觉内容；检索方法可能引入无关实体，加剧幻觉问题。

Method: 提出NES框架，包含三个阶段：使用合成图像确保检索一致性，过滤检索内容中的负实体（即输入中不存在但被生成的对象），并在注意力层面抑制这些负实体的影响。

Result: 在多个基准上验证了NES的有效性，保持领域内竞争力的同时显著提升跨域性能，降低幻觉率，达到当前最优水平。

Conclusion: NES有效缓解了零样本图像描述中的跨域幻觉问题，提升了模型的鲁棒性和实用性，为无需图像-文本配对数据的 captioning 方法提供了新的改进方向。

Abstract: Text-only training provides an attractive approach to address data scarcity challenges in zero-shot image captioning (ZIC), avoiding the expense of collecting paired image-text annotations. However, although these approaches perform well within training domains, they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization, often producing hallucinated content when encountering novel visual environments. Retrieval-based methods attempt to mitigate this limitation by leveraging external knowledge, but they can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination when retrieved captions contain entities irrelevant to the inputs. We introduce the concept of negative entities--objects that appear in generated caption but are absent from the input--and propose Negative Entity Suppression (NES) to tackle this challenge. NES seamlessly integrates three stages: (1) it employs synthetic images to ensure consistent image-to-text retrieval across both training and inference; (2) it filters negative entities from retrieved content to enhance accuracy; and (3) it applies attention-level suppression using identified negative entities to further minimize the impact of hallucination-prone features. Evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates that NES maintains competitive in-domain performance while improving cross-domain transfer and reducing hallucination rates, achieving new state-of-the-art results in ZIC.

Abstract: Deploying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on edge devices (e.g., smartphones and robots) is crucial for enabling low-latency and privacy-preserving intelligent applications. Given the resource constraints of these devices, quantization offers a promising solution by improving memory efficiency and reducing bandwidth requirements, thereby facilitating the deployment of VLMs. However, existing research has rarely explored aggressive quantization on VLMs, particularly for the models ranging from 1B to 2B parameters, which are more suitable for resource-constrained edge devices. In this paper, we propose SPEED-Q, a novel Staged Processing with Enhanced Distillation framework for VLM low-bit weight-only quantization that systematically addresses the following two critical obstacles: (1) significant discrepancies in quantization sensitivity between vision (ViT) and language (LLM) components in VLMs; (2) training instability arising from the reduced numerical precision inherent in low-bit quantization. In SPEED-Q, a staged sensitivity adaptive mechanism is introduced to effectively harmonize performance across different modalities. We further propose a distillation-enhanced quantization strategy to stabilize the training process and reduce data dependence. Together, SPEED-Q enables accurate, stable, and data-efficient quantization of complex VLMs. SPEED-Q is the first framework tailored for quantizing entire small-scale billion-parameter VLMs to low bits. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SPEED-Q achieves up to 6x higher accuracy than existing quantization methods under 2-bit settings and consistently outperforms prior on-device VLMs under both 2-bit and 4-bit settings. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/antgroup/SPEED-Q.

Abstract: Human-machine collaborative compression has been receiving increasing research efforts for reducing image/video data, serving as the basis for both human perception and machine intelligence. Existing collaborative methods are dominantly built upon the de facto human-vision compression pipeline, witnessing deficiency on complexity and bit-rates when aggregating the machine-vision compression. Indeed, machine vision solely focuses on the core regions within the image/video, requiring much less information compared with the compressed information for human vision. In this paper, we thus set out the first successful attempt by a novel collaborative compression method based on the machine-vision-oriented compression, instead of human-vision pipeline. In other words, machine vision serves as the basis for human vision within collaborative compression. A plug-and-play variable bit-rate strategy is also developed for machine vision tasks. Then, we propose to progressively aggregate the semantics from the machine-vision compression, whilst seamlessly tailing the diffusion prior to restore high-fidelity details for human vision, thus named as diffusion-prior based feature compression for human and machine visions (Diff-FCHM). Experimental results verify the consistently superior performances of our Diff-FCHM, on both machine-vision and human-vision compression with remarkable margins. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

Motivation: 扩散模型推理延迟高，现有蒸馏方法在保真度与稳定性之间存在权衡，需突破单步生成的质量瓶颈。

Method: 将轨迹蒸馏用于生成结构“草图”作为初始化，再通过分布蒸馏进行精细化；设计自适应加权判别器（AWD），动态关注局部缺陷以提升细节恢复能力。

Conclusion: HD框架结合两种蒸馏优势，配合AWD有效提升单步扩散模型质量，建立了高保真实时生成的新范式。

Abstract: The inference latency of diffusion models remains a critical barrier to their real-time application. While trajectory-based and distribution-based step distillation methods offer solutions, they present a fundamental trade-off. Trajectory-based methods preserve global structure but act as a "lossy compressor", sacrificing high-frequency details. Conversely, distribution-based methods can achieve higher fidelity but often suffer from mode collapse and unstable training. This paper recasts them from independent paradigms into synergistic components within our novel Hierarchical Distillation (HD) framework. We leverage trajectory distillation not as a final generator, but to establish a structural ``sketch", providing a near-optimal initialization for the subsequent distribution-based refinement stage. This strategy yields an ideal initial distribution that enhances the ceiling of overall performance. To further improve quality, we introduce and refine the adversarial training process. We find standard discriminator structures are ineffective at refining an already high-quality generator. To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive Weighted Discriminator (AWD), tailored for the HD pipeline. By dynamically allocating token weights, AWD focuses on local imperfections, enabling efficient detail refinement. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks. On ImageNet $256\times256$, our single-step model achieves an FID of 2.26, rivaling its 250-step teacher. It also achieves promising results on the high-resolution text-to-image MJHQ benchmark, proving its generalizability. Our method establishes a robust new paradigm for high-fidelity, single-step diffusion models.

Motivation: 现有集成攻击在异构模型间迁移性能不佳，主要由于不同架构模型的梯度更新方向差异大，难以有效降低梯度方差并充分利用各模型的优势。

Method: 提出NAMEA方法，首次将集成模型中非注意力区域的梯度引入迭代优化过程；通过解耦注意力与非注意力区域的梯度，并利用元学习进行梯度融合，以结合CNN和ViT的迁移信息。

Result: 在ImageNet上的实验表明，NAMEA相比当前最优方法AdaEA和SMER分别平均提升15.0%和9.6%的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: NAMEA有效提升了跨架构模型的对抗迁移性，是首次探索非注意力区域梯度融合的工作，为集成攻击提供了新思路。

Abstract: Ensemble attacks integrate the outputs of surrogate models with diverse architectures, which can be combined with various gradient-based attacks to improve adversarial transferability. However, previous work shows unsatisfactory attack performance when transferring across heterogeneous model architectures. The main reason is that the gradient update directions of heterogeneous surrogate models differ widely, making it hard to reduce the gradient variance of ensemble models while making the best of individual model. To tackle this challenge, we design a novel ensemble attack, NAMEA, which for the first time integrates the gradients from the non-attention areas of ensemble models into the iterative gradient optimization process. Our design is inspired by the observation that the attention areas of heterogeneous models vary sharply, thus the non-attention areas of ViTs are likely to be the focus of CNNs and vice versa. Therefore, we merge the gradients respectively from the attention and non-attention areas of ensemble models so as to fuse the transfer information of CNNs and ViTs. Specifically, we pioneer a new way of decoupling the gradients of non-attention areas from those of attention areas, while merging gradients by meta-learning. Empirical evaluations on ImageNet dataset indicate that NAMEA outperforms AdaEA and SMER, the state-of-the-art ensemble attacks by an average of 15.0% and 9.6%, respectively. This work is the first attempt to explore the power of ensemble non-attention in boosting cross-architecture transferability, providing new insights into launching ensemble attacks.

Motivation: 神经B帧视频压缩（NBVC）在分层编码中存在参考帧贡献不平衡问题，影响连续时间预测效果，需提升双向参考信息的利用效率。

Method: 提出BRHVC框架，包含BMC模块用于汇聚多光流以实现大范围精确运动补偿，以及BCF模块根据运动补偿精度显式建模参考上下文权重。

Result: 实验表明，BRHVC在HEVC数据集上优于现有最先进的神经视频压缩方法，并在随机访问配置下超过传统VTM-RA编码。

Conclusion: BRHVC通过有效协调双向参考帧的运动与上下文信息，显著提升NBVC性能，为神经视频压缩提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: Neural video compression (NVC) has made significant progress in recent years, while neural B-frame video compression (NBVC) remains underexplored compared to P-frame compression. NBVC can adopt bi-directional reference frames for better compression performance. However, NBVC's hierarchical coding may complicate continuous temporal prediction, especially at some hierarchical levels with a large frame span, which could cause the contribution of the two reference frames to be unbalanced. To optimize reference information utilization, we propose a novel NBVC method, termed Bi-directional Reference Harmonization Video Compression (BRHVC), with the proposed Bi-directional Motion Converge (BMC) and Bi-directional Contextual Fusion (BCF). BMC converges multiple optical flows in motion compression, leading to more accurate motion compensation on a larger scale. Then BCF explicitly models the weights of reference contexts under the guidance of motion compensation accuracy. With more efficient motions and contexts, BRHVC can effectively harmonize bi-directional references. Experimental results indicate that our BRHVC outperforms previous state-of-the-art NVC methods, even surpassing the traditional coding, VTM-RA (under random access configuration), on the HEVC datasets.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于豪斯多夫维度（HD）的新方法，用于提升分形生成模型（FGM）的生成多样性，同时保持高质量图像输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FGM在图像生成中具有高效性和高质量，但其固有的自相似性限制了输出多样性。因此，需要一种能够量化并增强结构复杂性的方法来改善生成结果的多样性。

Method: 提出可学习的HD估计方法，从图像嵌入中直接预测HD，并设计基于HD的损失函数结合单调动量调度策略，在训练中动态优化超参数；在推理阶段采用HD引导的拒绝采样以选择几何结构更丰富的输出。

Result: 在ImageNet上的实验表明，与原始FGM相比，所提FGM-HD框架在不牺牲视觉质量的前提下，输出多样性提升了39%。

Conclusion: 这是首次将HD引入FGM的工作，不仅显著提升了生成多样性，也为FGM的发展提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Improving the diversity of generated results while maintaining high visual quality remains a significant challenge in image generation tasks. Fractal Generative Models (FGMs) are efficient in generating high-quality images, but their inherent self-similarity limits the diversity of output images. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach based on the Hausdorff Dimension (HD), a widely recognized concept in fractal geometry used to quantify structural complexity, which aids in enhancing the diversity of generated outputs. To incorporate HD into FGM, we propose a learnable HD estimation method that predicts HD directly from image embeddings, addressing computational cost concerns. However, simply introducing HD into a hybrid loss is insufficient to enhance diversity in FGMs due to: 1) degradation of image quality, and 2) limited improvement in generation diversity. To this end, during training, we adopt an HD-based loss with a monotonic momentum-driven scheduling strategy to progressively optimize the hyperparameters, obtaining optimal diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Moreover, during inference, we employ HD-guided rejection sampling to select geometrically richer outputs. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our FGM-HD framework yields a 39\% improvement in output diversity compared to vanilla FGMs, while preserving comparable image quality. To our knowledge, this is the very first work introducing HD into FGM. Our method effectively enhances the diversity of generated outputs while offering a principled theoretical contribution to FGM development.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于生成模型和水印的静态电子签名认证框架AuthSig，通过在签名图像中隐式嵌入水印来实现“一次一用”策略，有效提升了静态电子签名的安全性和可验证性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态扫描签名因便捷而广泛使用，但缺乏有效的身份认证属性，易被复制和滥用，现有技术难以确保其安全性。

Method: 利用生成模型调节风格嵌入，在签名图像中隐式编码水印信息；提出关键点驱动的数据增强策略以提升风格多样性，支持鲁棒的水印嵌入。

Result: AuthSig在数字域失真和特定签名退化情况下提取准确率超过98%，在打印-扫描场景下仍保持有效。

Conclusion: AuthSig为静态电子签名提供了一种高效、安全的认证方案，实现了良好的视觉隐蔽性与高鲁棒性的平衡，推动电子签名向更安全的纸less工作流发展。

Abstract: With the deepening trend of paperless workflows, signatures as a means of identity authentication are gradually shifting from traditional ink-on-paper to electronic formats.Despite the availability of dynamic pressure-sensitive and PKI-based digital signatures, static scanned signatures remain prevalent in practice due to their convenience. However, these static images, having almost lost their authentication attributes, cannot be reliably verified and are vulnerable to malicious copying and reuse. To address these issues, we propose AuthSig, a novel static electronic signature framework based on generative models and watermark, which binds authentication information to the signature image. Leveraging the human visual system's insensitivity to subtle style variations, AuthSig finely modulates style embeddings during generation to implicitly encode watermark bits-enforcing a One Signature, One Use policy.To overcome the scarcity of handwritten signature data and the limitations of traditional augmentation methods, we introduce a keypoint-driven data augmentation strategy that effectively enhances style diversity to support robust watermark embedding. Experimental results show that AuthSig achieves over 98% extraction accuracy under both digital-domain distortions and signature-specific degradations, and remains effective even in print-scan scenarios.

Our method achieves under 2 m and 5 degrees error for 97.2% of 6-DoF registration attempts, with our multi-scale re-ranking module reducing localisation errors by ~2$\times$ on average.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs), enabling them to leverage a few examples directly from input contexts. However, the effectiveness of this approach is heavily reliant on the selection of demonstrations, a process that is NP-hard. Traditional strategies, including random, similarity-based sampling and infoscore-based sampling, often lead to inefficiencies or suboptimal performance, struggling to balance both efficiency and effectiveness in demonstration selection. In this paper, we propose a novel demonstration selection framework named Coreset-based Dual Retrieval (CoDR). We show that samples within a diverse subset achieve a higher expected mutual information. To implement this, we introduce a cluster-pruning method to construct a diverse coreset that aligns more effectively with the query while maintaining diversity. Additionally, we develop a dual retrieval mechanism that enhances the selection process by achieving global demonstration selection while preserving efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the ICL performance compared to the existing strategies, providing a robust solution for effective and efficient demonstration selection.

Motivation: 微动脉瘤（MAs）是糖尿病视网膜病变的最早标志性病变，但在眼底图像中因其尺寸小且形态多样，手动筛查费时且易出错；现有的扩散模型在MAs检测中存在身份映射、难以区分其他异常及正常结构重建不佳等问题，限制了其临床应用。

Abstract: Microaneurysms (MAs), the earliest pathognomonic signs of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), present as sub-60 $μm$ lesions in fundus images with highly variable photometric and morphological characteristics, rendering manual screening not only labor-intensive but inherently error-prone. While diffusion-based anomaly detection has emerged as a promising approach for automated MA screening, its clinical application is hindered by three fundamental limitations. First, these models often fall prey to "identity mapping", where they inadvertently replicate the input image. Second, they struggle to distinguish MAs from other anomalies, leading to high false positives. Third, their suboptimal reconstruction of normal features hampers overall performance. To address these challenges, we propose a Wavelet Diffusion Transformer framework for MA Detection (WDT-MD), which features three key innovations: a noise-encoded image conditioning mechanism to avoid "identity mapping" by perturbing image conditions during training; pseudo-normal pattern synthesis via inpainting to introduce pixel-level supervision, enabling discrimination between MAs and other anomalies; and a wavelet diffusion Transformer architecture that combines the global modeling capability of diffusion Transformers with multi-scale wavelet analysis to enhance reconstruction of normal retinal features. Comprehensive experiments on the IDRiD and e-ophtha MA datasets demonstrate that WDT-MD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both pixel-level and image-level MA detection. This advancement holds significant promise for improving early DR screening.

Abstract: Image segmentation is a core task in image processing, yet many methods degrade when images are heavily corrupted by noise and exhibit intensity inhomogeneity. Within the iterative-convolution thresholding method (ICTM) framework, we propose a variational segmentation model that integrates denoising terms. Specifically, the denoising component consists of an I-divergence term and an adaptive total-variation (TV) regularizer, making the model well suited to images contaminated by Gamma--distributed multiplicative noise and Poisson noise. A spatially adaptive weight derived from a gray-level indicator guides diffusion differently across regions of varying intensity. To further address intensity inhomogeneity, we estimate a smoothly varying bias field, which improves segmentation accuracy. Regions are represented by characteristic functions, with contour length encoded accordingly. For efficient optimization, we couple ICTM with a relaxed modified scalar auxiliary variable (RMSAV) scheme. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world images with intensity inhomogeneity and diverse noise types show that the proposed model achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared with competing approaches.

Conclusion: 负提示是提升开放集视觉识别系统性能的关键新维度，T-Rex-Omni为开放集检测提供了有效且灵活的新范式。

Abstract: Object detection methods have evolved from closed-set to open-set paradigms over the years. Current open-set object detectors, however, remain constrained by their exclusive reliance on positive indicators based on given prompts like text descriptions or visual exemplars. This positive-only paradigm experiences consistent vulnerability to visually similar but semantically different distractors. We propose T-Rex-Omni, a novel framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating negative visual prompts to negate hard negative distractors. Specifically, we first introduce a unified visual prompt encoder that jointly processes positive and negative visual prompts. Next, a training-free Negating Negative Computing (NNC) module is proposed to dynamically suppress negative responses during the probability computing stage. To further boost performance through fine-tuning, our Negating Negative Hinge (NNH) loss enforces discriminative margins between positive and negative embeddings. T-Rex-Omni supports flexible deployment in both positive-only and joint positive-negative inference modes, accommodating either user-specified or automatically generated negative examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate remarkable zero-shot detection performance, significantly narrowing the performance gap between visual-prompted and text-prompted methods while showing particular strength in long-tailed scenarios (51.2 AP_r on LVIS-minival). This work establishes negative prompts as a crucial new dimension for advancing open-set visual recognition systems.

Motivation: 现有方法多独立调节视觉或文本注意力，忽视二者交互作用，难以有效抑制幻觉。

Method: 构建因果图模型，提出VTACR指标量化模态贡献比，并设计基于该信号的细粒度注意力干预机制与双路径对比解码策略。

Result: 在POPE和CHAIR基准上显著降低幻觉率，达到SOTA的保真度同时保持图文理解能力。

Conclusion: Owl通过联合建模视觉-文本注意力交互，实现了更有效的幻觉抑制，为提升LVLM的可靠性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Object hallucination remains a critical challenge in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), where models generate content inconsistent with visual inputs. Existing language-decoder based mitigation approaches often regulate visual or textual attention independently, overlooking their interaction as two key causal factors. To address this, we propose Owl (Bi-mOdal attention reWeighting for Layer-wise hallucination mitigation), a causally-grounded framework that models hallucination process via a structural causal graph, treating decomposed visual and textual attentions as mediators. We introduce VTACR (Visual-to-Textual Attention Contribution Ratio), a novel metric that quantifies the modality contribution imbalance during decoding. Our analysis reveals that hallucinations frequently occur in low-VTACR scenarios, where textual priors dominate and visual grounding is weakened. To mitigate this, we design a fine-grained attention intervention mechanism that dynamically adjusts token- and layer-wise attention guided by VTACR signals. Finally, we propose a dual-path contrastive decoding strategy: one path emphasizes visually grounded predictions, while the other amplifies hallucinated ones -- letting visual truth shine and hallucination collapse. Experimental results on the POPE and CHAIR benchmarks show that Owl achieves significant hallucination reduction, setting a new SOTA in faithfulness while preserving vision-language understanding capability.

Abstract: Existing unsupervised image alignment methods exhibit limited accuracy and high computational complexity. To address these challenges, we propose a dense cross-scale image alignment model. It takes into account the correlations between cross-scale features to decrease the alignment difficulty. Our model supports flexible trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency by adjusting the number of scales utilized. Additionally, we introduce a fully spatial correlation module to further improve accuracy while maintaining low computational costs. We incorporate the just noticeable difference to encourage our model to focus on image regions more sensitive to distortions, eliminating noticeable alignment errors. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为USF-Net的统一时空融合网络，用于地面云图序列外推，结合自适应大核卷积和低复杂度注意力机制，并引入新的ASI-CIS数据集，显著提升了预测精度与计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有云图外推方法在动态特征提取、长距离时空依赖建模和计算效率方面存在不足，难以满足光伏系统应用需求。

Method: 提出USF-Net，包含编码器-解码器结构，编码器使用基本层提取特征，引入USTM模块（含SSM和TAM）以实现多尺度上下文捕捉和高效时序建模，设计DSM与TGM统一建模时空依赖，解码器采用DUM缓解‘鬼影效应’，并利用初始时态作为注意力算子保留运动特征。

Conclusion: USF-Net有效解决了静态特征提取、长程依赖建模和高计算成本等问题，为地面云图外推提供了高性能解决方案。

Abstract: Ground-based remote sensing cloud image sequence extrapolation is a key research area in the development of photovoltaic power systems. However, existing approaches exhibit several limitations:(1)they primarily rely on static kernels to augment feature information, lacking adaptive mechanisms to extract features at varying resolutions dynamically;(2)temporal guidance is insufficient, leading to suboptimal modeling of long-range spatiotemporal dependencies; and(3)the quadratic computational cost of attention mechanisms is often overlooked, limiting efficiency in practical deployment. To address these challenges, we propose USF-Net, a Unified Spatiotemporal Fusion Network that integrates adaptive large-kernel convolutions and a low-complexity attention mechanism, combining temporal flow information within an encoder-decoder framework. Specifically, the encoder employs three basic layers to extract features. Followed by the USTM, which comprises:(1)a SiB equipped with a SSM that dynamically captures multi-scale contextual information, and(2)a TiB featuring a TAM that effectively models long-range temporal dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency. In addition, a DSM with a TGM is introduced to enable unified modeling of temporally guided spatiotemporal dependencies. On the decoder side, a DUM is employed to address the common "ghosting effect." It utilizes the initial temporal state as an attention operator to preserve critical motion signatures. As a key contribution, we also introduce and release the ASI-CIS dataset. Extensive experiments on ASI-CIS demonstrate that USF-Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing a superior balance between prediction accuracy and computational efficiency for ground-based cloud extrapolation. The dataset and source code will be available at https://github.com/she1110/ASI-CIS.

To address these issues, we propose 4KDehazeFlow, a novel method based on Flow Matching and the Haze-Aware vector field. This method models the dehazing process as a progressive optimization of continuous vector field flow, providing efficient data-driven adaptive nonlinear color transformation for high-quality dehazing. Specifically, our method has the following advantages: 1) 4KDehazeFlow is a general method compatible with various deep learning networks, without relying on any specific network architecture. 2) We propose a learnable 3D lookup table (LUT) that encodes haze transformation parameters into a compact 3D mapping matrix, enabling efficient inference through precomputed mappings. 3) We utilize a fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver to stably solve the dehazing flow field through an accurate step-by-step iterative method, effectively suppressing artifacts. Extensive experiments show that 4KDehazeFlow exceeds seven state-of-the-art methods. It delivers a 2dB PSNR increase and better performance in dense haze and color fidelity.

TL;DR: PAN是一种通用、可交互的长时域世界模型，通过结合基于大语言模型的潜在动态架构与视频扩散解码器，实现基于历史和自然语言动作的高质量视频预测，统一了潜在空间推理与现实世界动力学。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型缺乏因果控制和长期一致性，而传统世界模型局限于特定领域且泛化能力差，难以支持开放环境下的交互式推理。

Method: 提出PAN模型，采用生成式潜在预测（GLP）架构：使用基于大语言模型的自回归潜在动力学主干进行语言条件下的动作建模，并结合视频扩散解码器生成视觉上逼真且时间连贯的视频序列。

Result: 在大规模跨域视频-动作对上训练后，PAN在动作条件下的世界模拟、长时域预测和模拟推理任务中表现优于现有方法，展现出更强的长期一致性和跨域泛化能力。

Conclusion: PAN推动了通用世界模型的发展，能够在开放域中实现可控、连贯且语义丰富的未来状态预测，为基于想象的规划与决策提供了新路径。

Abstract: A world model enables an intelligent agent to imagine, predict, and reason about how the world evolves in response to its actions, and accordingly to plan and strategize. While recent video generation models produce realistic visual sequences, they typically operate in the prompt-to-full-video manner without causal control, interactivity, or long-horizon consistency required for purposeful reasoning. Existing world modeling efforts, on the other hand, often focus on restricted domains (e.g., physical, game, or 3D-scene dynamics) with limited depth and controllability, and struggle to generalize across diverse environments and interaction formats. In this work, we introduce PAN, a general, interactable, and long-horizon world model that predicts future world states through high-quality video simulation conditioned on history and natural language actions. PAN employs the Generative Latent Prediction (GLP) architecture that combines an autoregressive latent dynamics backbone based on a large language model (LLM), which grounds simulation in extensive text-based knowledge and enables conditioning on language-specified actions, with a video diffusion decoder that reconstructs perceptually detailed and temporally coherent visual observations, to achieve a unification between latent space reasoning (imagination) and realizable world dynamics (reality). Trained on large-scale video-action pairs spanning diverse domains, PAN supports open-domain, action-conditioned simulation with coherent, long-term dynamics. Extensive experiments show that PAN achieves strong performance in action-conditioned world simulation, long-horizon forecasting, and simulative reasoning compared to other video generators and world models, taking a step towards general world models that enable predictive simulation of future world states for reasoning and acting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA系统在处理文化特定内容时受限于训练数据中文化知识的缺失且缺乏可解释性，难以支持文化敏感性与教育应用。

Method: 提出VietMEAgent框架，集成文化对象检测主干网络、结构化程序生成层和越南文化知识库；采用双模态解释模块，结合基于注意力的视觉证据与人类可读的文本推理。

Result: 构建了越南文化VQA数据集，并验证了基于程序的方法在文化AI中的实用性；系统能生成透明、包含文化背景的解释。

Conclusion: VietMEAgent提升了文化相关VQA任务的可解释性与文化适应性，有助于教育推广与文化传承。

Abstract: Contemporary Visual Question Answering (VQA) systems remain constrained when confronted with culturally specific content, largely because cultural knowledge is under-represented in training corpora and the reasoning process is not rendered interpretable to end users. This paper introduces VietMEAgent, a multimodal explainable framework engineered for Vietnamese cultural understanding. The method integrates a cultural object detection backbone with a structured program generation layer, yielding a pipeline in which answer prediction and explanation are tightly coupled. A curated knowledge base of Vietnamese cultural entities serves as an explicit source of background information, while a dual-modality explanation module combines attention-based visual evidence with structured, human-readable textual rationales. We further construct a Vietnamese Cultural VQA dataset sourced from public repositories and use it to demonstrate the practicality of programming-based methodologies for cultural AI. The resulting system provides transparent explanations that disclose both the computational rationale and the underlying cultural context, supporting education and cultural preservation with an emphasis on interpretability and cultural sensitivity.

### [45] [Diversifying Counterattacks: Orthogonal Exploration for Robust CLIP Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09064)
*Chengze Jiang,Minjing Dong,Xinli Shi,Jie Gui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的测试时反攻击方法Directional Orthogonal Counterattack (DOC)，通过引入正交梯度方向和动量更新来增强反攻击的多样性，从而提升视觉-语言预训练模型在面对对抗样本时的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时防御方法如TTC由于优化目标限制，生成的反攻击缺乏多样性，容易过拟合特定对抗模式，难以应对广泛的对抗扰动。因此，需要提升反攻击的覆盖范围和多样性以增强模型鲁棒性。

Method: 提出DOC方法，结合正交梯度方向和动量更新机制，在优化过程中扩展反攻击空间；同时设计基于平均余弦相似度的方向敏感性评分，自适应调节反攻击强度，提高样本判别能力。

Result: 在16个数据集上的实验表明，DOC在多种对抗攻击下均显著提升了模型的对抗鲁棒性，同时保持了较高的干净样本准确率。

Conclusion: 增强反攻击的多样性和探索范围对于提升测试时防御的有效性至关重要，DOC为视觉-语言模型提供了一种更通用且鲁棒的防御策略。

Abstract: Vision-language pre-training models (VLPs) demonstrate strong multimodal understanding and zero-shot generalization, yet remain vulnerable to adversarial examples, raising concerns about their reliability. Recent work, Test-Time Counterattack (TTC), improves robustness by generating perturbations that maximize the embedding deviation of adversarial inputs using PGD, pushing them away from their adversarial representations. However, due to the fundamental difference in optimization objectives between adversarial attacks and counterattacks, generating counterattacks solely based on gradients with respect to the adversarial input confines the search to a narrow space. As a result, the counterattacks could overfit limited adversarial patterns and lack the diversity to fully neutralize a broad range of perturbations. In this work, we argue that enhancing the diversity and coverage of counterattacks is crucial to improving adversarial robustness in test-time defense. Accordingly, we propose Directional Orthogonal Counterattack (DOC), which augments counterattack optimization by incorporating orthogonal gradient directions and momentum-based updates. This design expands the exploration of the counterattack space and increases the diversity of perturbations, which facilitates the discovery of more generalizable counterattacks and ultimately improves the ability to neutralize adversarial perturbations. Meanwhile, we present a directional sensitivity score based on averaged cosine similarity to boost DOC by improving example discrimination and adaptively modulating the counterattack strength. Extensive experiments on 16 datasets demonstrate that DOC improves adversarial robustness under various attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.

Motivation: 现实世界中的数据不断涌现，组合形式近乎无限且长尾分布，传统基于固定训练集的方法难以应对。因此，需要模型能够以增量方式持续提升组合泛化能力。

Method: 提出一种伪回放框架，利用视觉合成器生成已学组合的视觉表征，并通过语言基本单元蒸馏机制保持学习过程中基本语义单元表示的一致性。同时构建了MIT-States-CompIL和C-GQA-CompIL两个基准用于定量评估。

Conclusion: 该研究为组合泛化在动态、持续学习环境下的发展提供了新的框架和评估基准，推动了模型在真实场景中的适应能力。

Abstract: Compositional generalization has achieved substantial progress in computer vision on pre-collected training data. Nonetheless, real-world data continually emerges, with possible compositions being nearly infinite, long-tailed, and not entirely visible. Thus, an ideal model is supposed to gradually improve the capability of compositional generalization in an incremental manner. In this paper, we explore Composition-Incremental Learning for Compositional Generalization (CompIL) in the context of the compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) task, where models need to continually learn new compositions, intending to improve their compositional generalization capability progressively. To quantitatively evaluate CompIL, we develop a benchmark construction pipeline leveraging existing datasets, yielding MIT-States-CompIL and C-GQA-CompIL. Furthermore, we propose a pseudo-replay framework utilizing a visual synthesizer to synthesize visual representations of learned compositions and a linguistic primitive distillation mechanism to maintain aligned primitive representations across the learning process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

### [47] [Ultra-Light Test-Time Adaptation for Vision--Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09101)
*Byunghyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为UL-TTA的超轻量级测试时适应框架，用于提升视觉-语言模型在域偏移下的零样本识别性能。该方法无需反向传播或训练，仅通过在线贝叶斯更新logit层级的类原型、先验和温度参数来实现自适应，具有低延迟和高稳定性的优点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时适应方法通常需要对大型骨干网络进行反向传播、协方差估计或大量内存，在流式和边缘场景中不实用；同时，视觉-语言模型在域偏移下存在特征漂移、类别先验不匹配和校准性差的问题。

Method: 提出UL-TTA，冻结骨干网络，仅在logit级别进行自适应：(i) 使用选择性样本过滤保留高置信度预测；(ii) 基于文本锚定和狄利克雷先验，采用闭式贝叶斯更新类原型和先验；(iii) 解耦预测与校准用的温度参数；(iv) 引入轻量级保护机制（如范数裁剪、先验KL约束、平滑温度）防止长序列中的漂移。

Result: 在PACS、Office-Home等多个大规模跨域和OOD基准上验证，UL-TTA平均比零样本CLIP提升4.7个点的top-1准确率，ECE降低20-30%，延迟增加不到8%；在长达20万样本的流式实验中未出现性能崩溃。

Conclusion: logit级别的贝叶斯自适应足以在不更新骨干参数的情况下，实现最先进的视觉-语言模型在域偏移下的准确性与校准性权衡，适用于资源受限的流式场景。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot recognition by comparing image embeddings to text-derived class prototypes. However, under domain shift, they suffer from feature drift, class-prior mismatch, and severe miscalibration. Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods often require backpropagation through large backbones, covariance estimation, or heavy memory/state, which is problematic for streaming and edge scenarios. We propose Ultra-Light Test-Time Adaptation (UL-TTA), a fully training-free and backprop-free framework that freezes the backbone and adapts only logit-level parameters: class prototypes, class priors, and temperature. UL-TTA performs an online EM-style procedure with (i) selective sample filtering to use only confident predictions, (ii) closed-form Bayesian updates for prototypes and priors anchored by text and Dirichlet priors, (iii) decoupled temperatures for prediction vs. calibration, and (iv) lightweight guards (norm clipping, prior KL constraints, smoothed temperature) to prevent drift in long streams. Across large-scale cross-domain and OOD benchmarks (PACS, Office-Home, DomainNet, Terra Incognita, ImageNet-R/A/V2/Sketch; ~726K test samples) and strong TTA baselines including Tent, T3A, CoTTA, SAR, Tip-Adapter, and FreeTTA, UL-TTA consistently improves top-1 accuracy (e.g., +4.7 points over zero-shot CLIP on average) while reducing ECE by 20-30%, with less than 8% latency overhead. Long-stream experiments up to 200K samples show no collapse. Our results demonstrate that logit-level Bayesian adaptation is sufficient to obtain state-of-the-art accuracy-calibration trade-offs for VLMs under domain shift, without updating any backbone parameters.

Motivation: 由于只有少数专家能够阅读古日文草书Kuzushiji，且现有OCR技术难以应对文档退化和印章等噪声，因此需要一个专门的数据集来提升识别准确性。

Method: 构建了一个包含退化和印章的Kuzushiji文档数据集DKDS，并定义了两个基准任务：文本与印章检测、文档二值化。前者采用YOLO系列模型进行检测，后者测试了传统算法、结合K-means的传统方法及基于GAN的方法。

Result: 提供了两个任务的基线结果，实验表明不同方法在处理退化和印章干扰方面各有优劣，DKDS数据集有效支持了复杂场景下的Kuzushiji识别研究。

Conclusion: DKDS数据集填补了含噪声古籍文档识别的空白，为后续研究提供了重要基准和资源。

Abstract: Kuzushiji, a pre-modern Japanese cursive script, can currently be read and understood by only a few thousand trained experts in Japan. With the rapid development of deep learning, researchers have begun applying Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques to transcribe Kuzushiji into modern Japanese. Although existing OCR methods perform well on clean pre-modern Japanese documents written in Kuzushiji, they often fail to consider various types of noise, such as document degradation and seals, which significantly affect recognition accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, no existing dataset specifically addresses these challenges. To address this gap, we introduce the Degraded Kuzushiji Documents with Seals (DKDS) dataset as a new benchmark for related tasks. We describe the dataset construction process, which required the assistance of a trained Kuzushiji expert, and define two benchmark tracks: (1) text and seal detection and (2) document binarization. For the text and seal detection track, we provide baseline results using multiple versions of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) models for detecting Kuzushiji characters and seals. For the document binarization track, we present baseline results from traditional binarization algorithms, traditional algorithms combined with K-means clustering, and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based methods. The DKDS dataset and the implementation code for baseline methods are available at https://ruiyangju.github.io/DKDS.

Abstract: Flood mapping is crucial for assessing and mitigating flood impacts, yet traditional methods like numerical modeling and aerial photography face limitations in efficiency and reliability. To address these challenges, we propose PIFF, a physics-informed, flow-based generative neural network for near real-time flood depth estimation. Built on an image-to-image generative framework, it efficiently maps Digital Elevation Models (DEM) to flood depth predictions. The model is conditioned on a simplified inundation model (SPM) that embeds hydrodynamic priors into the training process. Additionally, a transformer-based rainfall encoder captures temporal dependencies in precipitation. Integrating physics-informed constraints with data-driven learning, PIFF captures the causal relationships between rainfall, topography, SPM, and flooding, replacing costly simulations with accurate, real-time flood maps. Using a 26 km study area in Tainan, Taiwan, with 182 rainfall scenarios ranging from 24 mm to 720 mm over 24 hours, our results demonstrate that PIFF offers an effective, data-driven alternative for flood prediction and response.

Abstract: Hundreds of benchmarks dedicated to evaluating large models from multiple perspectives have been presented over the past few years. Albeit substantial efforts, most of them remain closed-ended and are prone to overfitting due to the potential data contamination in the ever-growing training corpus of large models, thereby undermining the credibility of the evaluation. Moreover, the increasing scale and scope of current benchmarks with transient metrics, as well as the heavily human-dependent curation procedure, pose significant challenges for timely maintenance and adaptation to gauge the advancing capabilities of large models. In this paper, we introduce MACEval, a \Multi-Agent Continual Evaluation network for dynamic evaluation of large models, and define a new set of metrics to quantify performance longitudinally and sustainably. MACEval adopts an interactive and autonomous evaluation mode that employs role assignment, in-process data generation, and evaluation routing through a cascaded agent network. Extensive experiments on 9 open-ended tasks with 23 participating large models demonstrate that MACEval is (1) human-free and automatic, mitigating laborious result processing with inter-agent judgment guided; (2) efficient and economical, reducing a considerable amount of data and overhead to obtain similar results compared to related benchmarks; and (3) flexible and scalable, migrating or integrating existing benchmarks via customized evaluation topologies. We hope that MACEval can broaden future directions of large model evaluation.

Abstract: Multi-person global human mesh recovery (HMR) is crucial for understanding crowd dynamics and interactions. Traditional vision-based HMR methods sometimes face limitations in real-world scenarios due to mutual occlusions, insufficient lighting, and privacy concerns. Human-floor tactile interactions offer an occlusion-free and privacy-friendly alternative for capturing human motion. Existing research indicates that pressure signals acquired from tactile mats can effectively estimate human pose in single-person scenarios. However, when multiple individuals walk randomly on the mat simultaneously, how to distinguish intermingled pressure signals generated by different persons and subsequently acquire individual temporal pressure data remains a pending challenge for extending pressure-based HMR to the multi-person situation. In this paper, we present \textbf{PressTrack-HMR}, a top-down pipeline that recovers multi-person global human meshes solely from pressure signals. This pipeline leverages a tracking-by-detection strategy to first identify and segment each individual's pressure signal from the raw pressure data, and subsequently performs HMR for each extracted individual signal. Furthermore, we build a multi-person interaction pressure dataset \textbf{MIP}, which facilitates further research into pressure-based human motion analysis in multi-person scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method excels in multi-person HMR using pressure data, with 89.2~$mm$ MPJPE and 112.6~$mm$ WA-MPJPE$_{100}$, and these showcase the potential of tactile mats for ubiquitous, privacy-preserving multi-person action recognition.

*Yanlin Wu,Xiaogang Yuan,Dezhi An*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型反演的视频检测方法DBINDS，通过分析潜在空间中的初始噪声差异序列（INDS）来区分真实与生成视频，在跨生成器场景下表现出良好的泛化性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI生成视频检测方法依赖像素级特征，难以泛化到未见过的生成器，因此需要一种更具通用性的检测机制。

Method: 利用扩散模型反演技术恢复视频生成过程中的初始噪声序列，构建初始噪声差异序列（INDS），并提取多域多尺度特征，结合LightGBM分类器与贝叶斯优化进行训练。

Result: DBINDS在仅使用单一生成器训练的情况下，在GenVidBench基准上实现了优异的跨生成器检测性能，且在数据有限的场景下仍保持稳健。

Conclusion: 通过分析潜在空间动态而非像素特征，DBINDS提供了一种更具泛化能力的AI生成视频检测方案，对内容安全和取证分析具有重要意义。

Abstract: AI-generated video has advanced rapidly and poses serious challenges to content security and forensic analysis. Existing detectors rely mainly on pixel-level visual cues and generalize poorly to unseen generators. We propose DBINDS, a diffusion-model-inversion based detector that analyzes latent-space dynamics rather than pixels. We find that initial noise sequences recovered by diffusion inversion differ systematically between real and generated videos. Building on this, DBINDS forms an Initial Noise Difference Sequence (INDS) and extracts multi-domain, multi-scale features. With feature optimization and a LightGBM classifier tuned by Bayesian search, DBINDS (trained on a single generator) achieves strong cross-generator performance on GenVidBench, demonstrating good generalization and robustness in limited-data settings.

*Yuhao Shen,Jiahe Qian,Shuping Zhang,Zhangtianyi Chen,Tao Lu,Juexiao Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合DermBench和DermEval的新型评估框架，用于对多模态大语言模型在皮肤科诊断中的表现进行可靠、可重复且可扩展的评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在皮肤科图像诊断中应用广泛，但缺乏可靠、临床有意义的评估方法，阻碍了其在临床环境中的负责任部署。

Method: 构建了包含4000张真实皮肤科图像和专家认证诊断叙述的DermBench基准，并开发了基于大语言模型的评分机制；同时训练了一个无需参考文本的多模态评估器DermEval，能够对生成的诊断叙述进行结构化批评和打分。

Result: 在4500个病例上的实验表明，DermBench和DermEval与专家评分高度一致，平均偏差分别为0.251和0.117（满分5分），能有效评估不同多模态大模型的诊断能力和可信度。

Conclusion: 所提出的评估框架实现了对多模态大语言模型在皮肤科诊断任务中性能的可靠、细粒度评估，有助于发现模型局限性和偏见，推动其在临床场景中的安全应用。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate dermatology diagnostic narratives directly from images. However, reliable evaluation remains the primary bottleneck for responsible clinical deployment. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines DermBench, a meticulously curated benchmark, with DermEval, a robust automatic evaluator, to enable clinically meaningful, reproducible, and scalable assessment. We build DermBench, which pairs 4,000 real-world dermatology images with expert-certified diagnostic narratives and uses an LLM-based judge to score candidate narratives across clinically grounded dimensions, enabling consistent and comprehensive evaluation of multimodal models. For individual case assessment, we train DermEval, a reference-free multimodal evaluator. Given an image and a generated narrative, DermEval produces a structured critique along with an overall score and per-dimension ratings. This capability enables fine-grained, per-case analysis, which is critical for identifying model limitations and biases. Experiments on a diverse dataset of 4,500 cases demonstrate that DermBench and DermEval achieve close alignment with expert ratings, with mean deviations of 0.251 and 0.117 (out of 5), respectively, providing reliable measurement of diagnostic ability and trustworthiness across different multimodal LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了TACO框架，通过自验证和置信度校准来减少多模态大语言模型中的幻觉问题，无需依赖外部视觉专家。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）常出现对象存在性、属性或关系的幻觉错误，影响其可靠性。

Method: 将响应分解为原子查询，通过改写降低对措辞的敏感性，并利用自洽性（黑盒）或自信心（灰盒）聚合估计置信度，最后用语言模型优化答案。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，使用两种MLLMs进行实验表明，TACO优于直接提示和视觉对比解码方法，减少了系统性偏差并改善了置信度校准。

Conclusion: TACO能有效提升MLLMs输出的忠实性和可靠性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often suffer from hallucinations, particularly errors in object existence, attributes, or relations, which undermine their reliability. We introduce TACO (Verified Atomic Confidence Estimation), a simple framework that mitigates hallucinations through self-verification and confidence calibration without relying on external vision experts. TACO decomposes responses into atomic queries, paraphrases them to reduce sensitivity to wording, and estimates confidence using self-consistency (black-box) or self-confidence (gray-box) aggregation, before refining answers with a language model. Experiments on five benchmarks (POPE, MME, HallusionBench, AMBER, and MM-Hal Bench) with two MLLMs (\texttt{LLaVA-1.5-7B} and \texttt{CogVLM2}) show that TACO consistently outperforms direct prompting and Visual Contrastive Decoding, reduces systematic biases, and improves confidence calibration, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the faithfulness of MLLMs.

*Kaixiang Shu,Kai Meng,Junqin Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于信息瓶颈的新型框架S-IB，通过优化反向传播中的Vector-Jacobian积的空间结构，在训练过程中实现特征解耦，提升模型可解释性、鲁棒性和分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络通常学习到空间上纠缠的表示，将判别性的前景特征与背景中的虚假相关性混淆，影响模型的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Method: 从信息论角度重新理解基于梯度的归因方法，证明在温和条件下反向传播中的Vector-Jacobian积（VJP）构成输入特征关于类别标签的极小充分统计量，并提出编码-解码视角：前向传播编码输入到类别空间，VJP在反向传播中将其解码回特征空间；基于此提出空间信息瓶颈（S-IB），通过最大化前景区域的互信息、最小化背景区域的互信息来解耦信息流。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上实验表明，S-IB在六种不同的解释方法下均显著提升了可视化质量，实现了更好的前景聚焦和背景抑制，且无需针对特定方法调参，同时带来一致的分类准确率提升。

Conclusion: S-IB通过直接优化VJP的空间结构，在训练阶段改善了模型的内部表示，不仅增强了模型的可解释性和鲁棒性，还提升了分类性能，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks typically learn spatially entangled representations that conflate discriminative foreground features with spurious background correlations, thereby undermining model interpretability and robustness. We propose a novel understanding framework for gradient-based attribution from an information-theoretic perspective. We prove that, under mild conditions, the Vector-Jacobian Products (VJP) computed during backpropagation form minimal sufficient statistics of input features with respect to class labels. Motivated by this finding, we propose an encoding-decoding perspective : forward propagation encodes inputs into class space, while VJP in backpropagation decodes this encoding back to feature space. Therefore, we propose Spatial Information Bottleneck (S-IB) to spatially disentangle information flow. By maximizing mutual information between foreground VJP and inputs while minimizing mutual information in background regions, S-IB encourages networks to encode information only in class-relevant spatial regions. Since post-hoc explanation methods fundamentally derive from VJP computations, directly optimizing VJP's spatial structure during training improves visualization quality across diverse explanation paradigms. Experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate universal improvements across six explanation methods, achieving better foreground concentration and background suppression without method-specific tuning, alongside consistent classification accuracy gains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于AGC解码器参数多、算法难以动态适应且计算和数据传输功耗高，难以在资源和功率受限的边缘设备上部署。

Method: 分析AGC算法，采用训练后静态量化和层融合等网络压缩方法，并设计基于协处理器模式的重叠加速器，利用双缓冲流水线和循环展开等并行优化策略进行软硬件协同设计。

Result: 在PYNQ-Z1平台上构建了AGC FPGA原型系统，相比商用CPU和GPU分别实现了24.9倍和4.1倍的能效提升，每个像素重建仅需11.7微焦耳（μJ）。

Conclusion: 所提出的FPGA导向的AGC部署方案显著提升了能效，适合资源受限的边缘设备，为未来低功耗视频服务提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: The Animation-based Generative Codec (AGC) is an emerging paradigm for talking-face video compression. However, deploying its intricate decoder on resource and power-constrained edge devices presents challenges due to numerous parameters, the inflexibility to adapt to dynamically evolving algorithms, and the high power consumption induced by extensive computations and data transmission. This paper for the first time proposes a novel field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)-oriented AGC deployment scheme for edge-computing video services. Initially, we analyze the AGC algorithm and employ network compression methods including post-training static quantization and layer fusion techniques. Subsequently, we design an overlapped accelerator utilizing the co-processor paradigm to perform computations through software-hardware co-design. The hardware processing unit comprises engines such as convolution, grid sampling, upsample, etc. Parallelization optimization strategies like double-buffered pipelines and loop unrolling are employed to fully exploit the resources of FPGA. Ultimately, we establish an AGC FPGA prototype on the PYNQ-Z1 platform using the proposed scheme, achieving \textbf{24.9$\times$} and \textbf{4.1$\times$} higher energy efficiency against commercial Central Processing Unit (CPU) and Graphic Processing Unit (GPU), respectively. Specifically, only \textbf{11.7} microjoules ($\upmu$J) are required for one pixel reconstructed by this FPGA system.

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了不同神经网络架构和生理信号组合在能量消耗估计中的表现，发现分钟通气量是最具预测性的单一信号，Transformer模型表现最佳（RMSE为0.87 W/kg）；组合信号适合轻量模型如CNN和ResNet，且低强度活动预测效果更好，个体间差异显著，需自适应建模策略。

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法较少区分神经网络架构与信号选择的影响，本文旨在系统性评估这两者对能量消耗估计性能的作用。

Method: 比较经典回归方法与多种深度学习架构（如Transformer、CNN、ResNet+注意力）在单一生理信号、信号对及多信号组合输入下的表现，使用RMSE和NRMSE评估模型性能。

Result: 分钟通气量是最优单一信号（Transformer达最低RMSE 0.87 W/kg）；Hexoskin多信号组合适合更快的CNN和ResNet模型；低强度活动预测精度高（RMSE低至0.29 W/kg，NRMSE=0.04），高强度任务绝对误差较大但归一化误差相近；个体间差异显著。

Conclusion: 信号选择对能量消耗估计影响重大，分钟通气量最具预测力；复杂模型适用于高精度场景，轻量模型可配合多信号使用；未来应关注个体化和自适应建模以提升泛化能力。

Abstract: Energy expenditure estimation aims to infer human metabolic rate from physiological signals such as heart rate, respiration, or accelerometer data, and has been studied primarily with classical regression methods. The few existing deep learning approaches rarely disentangle the role of neural architecture from that of signal choice. In this work, we systematically evaluate both aspects. We compare classical baselines with newer neural architectures across single signals, signal pairs, and grouped sensor inputs for diverse physical activities. Our results show that minute ventilation is the most predictive individual signal, with a transformer model achieving the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.87 W/kg across all activities. Paired and grouped signals, such as those from the Hexoskin smart shirt (five signals), offer good alternatives for faster models like CNN and ResNet with attention. Per-activity evaluation revealed mixed outcomes: notably better results in low-intensity activities (RMSE down to 0.29 W/kg; NRMSE = 0.04), while higher-intensity tasks showed larger RMSE but more comparable normalized errors. Finally, subject-level analysis highlights strong inter-individual variability, motivating the need for adaptive modeling strategies. Our code and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/Sarvibabakhani/deeplearning-biosignals-ee .

Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏方法多依赖单一视觉模态，缺乏跨模态知识多样性，本文旨在探索利用CLIP的视觉-语言表征作为补充监督信号，增强知识迁移效果。

Method: 提出RichKD框架，融合传统教师模型的logits与特征和CLIP模型（结合多提示文本引导）的输出，实现跨模态知识整合，用于训练学生模型。

Result: RichKD在多个基准上优于现有方法，显著提升学生模型的准确率、预测置信度校准能力，并改善非目标类别的语义一致性与分布外鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 引入CLIP的跨模态监督可有效丰富知识蒸馏过程，所提出的简单融合策略能显著提升蒸馏性能与模型可靠性，为多教师KD提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multi-teacher knowledge distillation (KD), a more effective technique than traditional single-teacher methods, transfers knowledge from expert teachers to a compact student model using logit or feature matching. However, most existing approaches lack knowledge diversity, as they rely solely on unimodal visual information, overlooking the potential of cross-modal representations. In this work, we explore the use of CLIP's vision-language knowledge as a complementary source of supervision for KD, an area that remains largely underexplored. We propose a simple yet effective framework that fuses the logits and features of a conventional teacher with those from CLIP. By incorporating CLIP's multi-prompt textual guidance, the fused supervision captures both dataset-specific and semantically enriched visual cues. Beyond accuracy, analysis shows that the fused teacher yields more confident and reliable predictions, significantly increasing confident-correct cases while reducing confidently wrong ones. Moreover, fusion with CLIP refines the entire logit distribution, producing semantically meaningful probabilities for non-target classes, thereby improving inter-class consistency and distillation quality. Despite its simplicity, the proposed method, Enriching Knowledge Distillation (RichKD), consistently outperforms most existing baselines across multiple benchmarks and exhibits stronger robustness under distribution shifts and input corruptions.

Abstract: The rise of 3D generative models has enabled automatic 3D geometry and texture synthesis from multimodal inputs (e.g., text or images). However, these methods often ignore physical constraints and manufacturability considerations. In this work, we address the challenge of producing 3D designs that are both lightweight and self-supporting. We present DensiCrafter, a framework for generating lightweight, self-supporting 3D hollow structures by optimizing the density field. Starting from coarse voxel grids produced by Trellis, we interpret these as continuous density fields to optimize and introduce three differentiable, physically constrained, and simulation-free loss terms. Additionally, a mass regularization penalizes unnecessary material, while a restricted optimization domain preserves the outer surface. Our method seamlessly integrates with pretrained Trellis-based models (e.g., Trellis, DSO) without any architectural changes. In extensive evaluations, we achieve up to 43% reduction in material mass on the text-to-3D task. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our method could improve the stability and maintain high geometric fidelity. Real-world 3D-printing experiments confirm that our hollow designs can be reliably fabricated and could be self-supporting.

Conclusion: 所提出的反馈机制充分挖掘了教师-学生框架内在的纠错能力，双教师结构进一步增强了反馈动态，显著改善了半监督医学图像分割的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: The teacher-student paradigm has emerged as a canonical framework in semi-supervised learning. When applied to medical image segmentation, the paradigm faces challenges due to inherent image ambiguities, making it particularly vulnerable to erroneous supervision. Crucially, the student's iterative reconfirmation of these errors leads to self-reinforcing bias. While some studies attempt to mitigate this bias, they often rely on external modifications to the conventional teacher-student framework, overlooking its intrinsic potential for error correction. In response, this work introduces a feedback mechanism into the teacher-student framework to counteract error reconfirmations. Here, the student provides feedback on the changes induced by the teacher's pseudo-labels, enabling the teacher to refine these labels accordingly. We specify that this interaction hinges on two key components: the feedback attributor, which designates pseudo-labels triggering the student's update, and the feedback receiver, which determines where to apply this feedback. Building on this, a dual-teacher feedback model is further proposed, which allows more dynamics in the feedback loop and fosters more gains by resolving disagreements through cross-teacher supervision while avoiding consistent errors. Comprehensive evaluations on three medical image benchmarks demonstrate the method's effectiveness in addressing error propagation in semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Camera-based multi-view 3D detection is crucial for autonomous driving. PETR and its variants (PETRs) excel in benchmarks but face deployment challenges due to high computational cost and memory footprint. Quantization is an effective technique for compressing deep neural networks by reducing the bit width of weights and activations. However, directly applying existing quantization methods to PETRs leads to severe accuracy degradation. This issue primarily arises from two key challenges: (1) significant magnitude disparity between multi-modal features-specifically, image features and camera-ray positional embeddings (PE), and (2) the inefficiency and approximation error of quantizing non-linear operators, which commonly rely on hardware-unfriendly computations. In this paper, we propose FQ-PETR, a fully quantized framework for PETRs, featuring three key innovations: (1) Quantization-Friendly LiDAR-ray Position Embedding (QFPE): Replacing multi-point sampling with LiDAR-prior-guided single-point sampling and anchor-based embedding eliminates problematic non-linearities (e.g., inverse-sigmoid) and aligns PE scale with image features, preserving accuracy. (2) Dual-Lookup Table (DULUT): This algorithm approximates complex non-linear functions using two cascaded linear LUTs, achieving high fidelity with minimal entries and no specialized hardware. (3) Quantization After Numerical Stabilization (QANS): Performing quantization after softmax numerical stabilization mitigates attention distortion from large inputs. On PETRs (e.g. PETR, StreamPETR, PETRv2, MV2d), FQ-PETR under W8A8 achieves near-floating-point accuracy (1% degradation) while reducing latency by up to 75%, significantly outperforming existing PTQ and QAT baselines.

Abstract: Moving infrared small target detection (IRSTD) plays a critical role in practical applications, such as surveillance of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and UAV-based search system. Moving IRSTD still remains highly challenging due to weak target features and complex background interference. Accurate spatio-temporal feature modeling is crucial for moving target detection, typically achieved through either temporal differences or spatio-temporal (3D) convolutions. Temporal difference can explicitly leverage motion cues but exhibits limited capability in extracting spatial features, whereas 3D convolution effectively represents spatio-temporal features yet lacks explicit awareness of motion dynamics along the temporal dimension. In this paper, we propose a novel moving IRSTD network (TDCNet), which effectively extracts and enhances spatio-temporal features for accurate target detection. Specifically, we introduce a novel temporal difference convolution (TDC) re-parameterization module that comprises three parallel TDC blocks designed to capture contextual dependencies across different temporal ranges. Each TDC block fuses temporal difference and 3D convolution into a unified spatio-temporal convolution representation. This re-parameterized module can effectively capture multi-scale motion contextual features while suppressing pseudo-motion clutter in complex backgrounds, significantly improving detection performance. Moreover, we propose a TDC-guided spatio-temporal attention mechanism that performs cross-attention between the spatio-temporal features from the TDC-based backbone and a parallel 3D backbone. This mechanism models their global semantic dependencies to refine the current frame's features. Extensive experiments on IRSTD-UAV and public infrared datasets demonstrate that our TDCNet achieves state-of-the-art detection performance in moving target detection.

Abstract: Recognizing unseen skeleton action categories remains highly challenging due to the absence of corresponding skeletal priors. Existing approaches generally follow an "align-then-classify" paradigm but face two fundamental issues, i.e., (i) fragile point-to-point alignment arising from imperfect semantics, and (ii) rigid classifiers restricted by static decision boundaries and coarse-grained anchors. To address these issues, we propose a novel method for zero-shot skeleton action recognition, termed $\texttt{$\textbf{Flora}$}$, which builds upon $\textbf{F}$lexib$\textbf{L}$e neighb$\textbf{O}$r-aware semantic attunement and open-form dist$\textbf{R}$ibution-aware flow cl$\textbf{A}$ssifier. Specifically, we flexibly attune textual semantics by incorporating neighboring inter-class contextual cues to form direction-aware regional semantics, coupled with a cross-modal geometric consistency objective that ensures stable and robust point-to-region alignment. Furthermore, we employ noise-free flow matching to bridge the modality distribution gap between semantic and skeleton latent embeddings, while a condition-free contrastive regularization enhances discriminability, leading to a distribution-aware classifier with fine-grained decision boundaries achieved through token-level velocity predictions. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our method, showing particularly impressive performance even when trained with only 10\% of the seen data.

Abstract: Accurate intra-operative localization of the bronchoscope tip relative to patient anatomy remains challenging due to respiratory motion, anatomical variability, and CT-to-body divergence that cause deformation and misalignment between intra-operative views and pre-operative CT. Existing vision-based methods often fail to generalize across domains and patients, leading to residual alignment errors. This work establishes a generalizable foundation for bronchoscopy navigation through a robust vision-based framework and a new synthetic benchmark dataset that enables standardized and reproducible evaluation. We propose a vision-based pose optimization framework for frame-wise 2D-3D registration between intra-operative endoscopic views and pre-operative CT anatomy. A fine-tuned modality- and domain-invariant encoder enables direct similarity computation between real endoscopic RGB frames and CT-rendered depth maps, while a differentiable rendering module iteratively refines camera poses through depth consistency. To enhance reproducibility, we introduce the first public synthetic benchmark dataset for bronchoscopy navigation, addressing the lack of paired CT-endoscopy data. Trained exclusively on synthetic data distinct from the benchmark, our model achieves an average translational error of 2.65 mm and a rotational error of 0.19 rad, demonstrating accurate and stable localization. Qualitative results on real patient data further confirm strong cross-domain generalization, achieving consistent frame-wise 2D-3D alignment without domain-specific adaptation. Overall, the proposed framework achieves robust, domain-invariant localization through iterative vision-based optimization, while the new benchmark provides a foundation for standardized progress in vision-based bronchoscopy navigation.

Conclusion: 本研究提供了首个美式足球运动员专用数据集，验证了精细化模型在高密度复杂场景中的有效性，推动了该领域多目标跟踪技术的发展，为未来研究和应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) plays a critical role in analyzing player behavior from videos, enabling performance evaluation. Current MOT methods are often evaluated using publicly available datasets. However, most of these focus on everyday scenarios such as pedestrian tracking or are tailored to specific sports, including soccer and basketball. Despite the inherent challenges of tracking players in American football, such as frequent occlusion and physical contact, no standardized dataset has been publicly available, making fair comparisons between methods difficult. To address this gap, we constructed the first dedicated detection and tracking dataset for the American football players and conducted a comparative evaluation of various detection and tracking methods. Our results demonstrate that accurate detection and tracking can be achieved even in crowded scenarios. Fine-tuning detection models improved performance over pre-trained models. Furthermore, when these fine-tuned detectors and re-identification models were integrated into tracking systems, we observed notable improvements in tracking accuracy compared to existing approaches. This work thus enables robust detection and tracking of American football players in challenging, high-density scenarios previously underserved by conventional methods.

Motivation: 现有跨架构知识蒸馏方法存在架构不匹配问题，且忽视了强同构CNN教师的价值，导致轻量CNN模型性能受限。

Method: 设计双教师框架，引入差异感知的教师加权机制，并通过轻量辅助分支学习ViT与CNN教师间的残差特征，实现更有效的知识迁移。

Result: 在HMDB51、EPIC-KITCHENS-100和Kinetics-400等数据集上显著优于现有蒸馏方法，HMDB51上最高提升5.95%准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法有效缓解了架构差异带来的负面影响，充分利用异构与同构教师的优势，显著提升了轻量CNN模型的识别精度。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved strong performance in video action recognition, but their high computational cost limits their practicality. Lightweight CNNs are more efficient but suffer from accuracy gaps. Cross-Architecture Knowledge Distillation (CAKD) addresses this by transferring knowledge from ViTs to CNNs, yet existing methods often struggle with architectural mismatch and overlook the value of stronger homogeneous CNN teachers. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Dual-Teacher Knowledge Distillation framework that leverages both a heterogeneous ViT teacher and a homogeneous CNN teacher to collaboratively guide a lightweight CNN student. We introduce two key components: (1) Discrepancy-Aware Teacher Weighting, which dynamically fuses the predictions from ViT and CNN teachers by assigning adaptive weights based on teacher confidence and prediction discrepancy with the student, enabling more informative and effective supervision; and (2) a Structure Discrepancy-Aware Distillation strategy, where the student learns the residual features between ViT and CNN teachers via a lightweight auxiliary branch, focusing on transferable architectural differences without mimicking all of ViT's high-dimensional patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including HMDB51, EPIC-KITCHENS-100, and Kinetics-400 demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art distillation approaches, achieving notable performance improvements with a maximum accuracy gain of 5.95% on HMDB51.

TL;DR: 提出DreamPose3D，一种结合动作感知推理与时间想象的扩散框架，用于3D人体姿态估计，在多个数据集上实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖几何线索且独立预测每帧3D姿态，难以处理运动模糊和真实场景泛化，缺乏对高层动作意图和关节结构关系的建模。

Method: 采用扩散模型框架，通过从2D姿态序列提取动作提示动态调节去噪过程；引入融合运动学关节亲和力的注意力机制编码器；设计具有幻觉解码能力的时序一致3D姿态生成解码器。

Result: 在Human3.6M和MPI-3DHP数据集上取得所有指标的最先进性能，并在广播级棒球数据集上展现出对噪声和模糊输入的强鲁棒性，有效保持时间连贯性和意图驱动变化。

Conclusion: DreamPose3D通过结合动作意识、关节结构建模和时间想象，显著提升了3D人体姿态估计的准确性和鲁棒性，验证了类人运动推理机制在视觉理解任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Accurate 3D human pose estimation remains a critical yet unresolved challenge, requiring both temporal coherence across frames and fine-grained modeling of joint relationships. However, most existing methods rely solely on geometric cues and predict each 3D pose independently, which limits their ability to resolve ambiguous motions and generalize to real-world scenarios. Inspired by how humans understand and anticipate motion, we introduce DreamPose3D, a diffusion-based framework that combines action-aware reasoning with temporal imagination for 3D pose estimation. DreamPose3D dynamically conditions the denoising process using task-relevant action prompts extracted from 2D pose sequences, capturing high-level intent. To model the structural relationships between joints effectively, we introduce a representation encoder that incorporates kinematic joint affinity into the attention mechanism. Finally, a hallucinative pose decoder predicts temporally coherent 3D pose sequences during training, simulating how humans mentally reconstruct motion trajectories to resolve ambiguity in perception. Extensive experiments on benchmarked Human3.6M and MPI-3DHP datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all metrics. To further validate DreamPose3D's robustness, we tested it on a broadcast baseball dataset, where it demonstrated strong performance despite ambiguous and noisy 2D inputs, effectively handling temporal consistency and intent-driven motion variations.

Conclusion: vMFCoOp有效提升了生物医学视觉-语言模型的小样本分类性能，具备良好的扩展性和应用前景。

Abstract: Recent advances in context optimization (CoOp) guided by large language model (LLM)-distilled medical semantic priors offer a scalable alternative to manual prompt engineering and full fine-tuning for adapting biomedical CLIP-based vision-language models (VLMs). However, prompt learning in this context is challenged by semantic misalignment between LLMs and CLIP variants due to divergent training corpora and model architectures; it further lacks scalability across continuously evolving families of foundation models. More critically, pairwise multimodal alignment via conventional Euclidean-space optimization lacks the capacity to model unified representations or apply localized geometric constraints, which tends to amplify modality gaps in complex biomedical imaging and destabilize few-shot adaptation. In this work, we propose vMFCoOp, a framework that inversely estimates von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions on a shared Hyperspherical Manifold, aligning semantic biases between arbitrary LLMs and CLIP backbones via Unified Semantic Anchors to achieve robust biomedical prompting and superior few-shot classification. Grounded in three complementary constraints, vMFCoOp demonstrates consistent improvements across 14 medical datasets, 12 medical imaging modalities, and 13 anatomical regions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, generalization, and clinical applicability. This work will be continuously expanded to encompass more downstream applications, and the corresponding resources are intended to be shared through https://github.com/VinyehShaw/UniEqui.

TL;DR: RF-DETR是一种轻量级检测Transformer，通过权重共享的神经架构搜索（NAS）在目标数据集上发现精度-延迟帕累托曲线，显著提升了在COCO和Roboflow100-VL等真实数据集上的泛化性能和实时性。

Motivation: 现有开放词汇检测器在分布外类别上的泛化能力差，且重型视觉语言模型难以高效适应新领域。

Method: 提出RF-DETR，基于预训练模型，通过改进可调参数的权重共享NAS，在不重新训练的情况下评估多种网络配置，实现精度与延迟的权衡优化。

Result: RF-DETR (nano)在COCO上达到48.0 AP，超过D-FINE 5.3 AP；RF-DETR (2x-large)在Roboflow100-VL上超越GroundingDINO 1.2 AP且快20倍，并首次实现实时检测器在COCO上突破60 AP。

Conclusion: RF-DETR通过轻量级设计和改进的NAS方法，有效提升开放词汇检测器在真实场景中的泛化能力和效率，为实际应用提供了高性能实时解决方案。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary detectors achieve impressive performance on COCO, but often fail to generalize to real-world datasets with out-of-distribution classes not typically found in their pre-training. Rather than simply fine-tuning a heavy-weight vision-language model (VLM) for new domains, we introduce RF-DETR, a light-weight specialist detection transformer that discovers accuracy-latency Pareto curves for any target dataset with weight-sharing neural architecture search (NAS). Our approach fine-tunes a pre-trained base network on a target dataset and evaluates thousands of network configurations with different accuracy-latency tradeoffs without re-training. Further, we revisit the "tunable knobs" for NAS to improve the transferability of DETRs to diverse target domains. Notably, RF-DETR significantly improves on prior state-of-the-art real-time methods on COCO and Roboflow100-VL. RF-DETR (nano) achieves 48.0 AP on COCO, beating D-FINE (nano) by 5.3 AP at similar latency, and RF-DETR (2x-large) outperforms GroundingDINO (tiny) by 1.2 AP on Roboflow100-VL while running 20x as fast. To the best of our knowledge, RF-DETR (2x-large) is the first real-time detector to surpass 60 AP on COCO. Our code is at https://github.com/roboflow/rf-detr

### [71] [GMTRouter: Personalized LLM Router over Multi-turn User Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08590)
*Encheng Xie,Yihang Sun,Tao Feng,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为GMTRouter的个性化大语言模型路由方法，通过构建包含用户、LLM、查询和响应四种节点的异构图，并采用定制的消息传递机制，在少量数据下实现对用户偏好的有效建模，实验证明其在准确率和AUC上均优于现有方法，并能快速适应新用户和变化的偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型路由方法在个性化方面不足，难以捕捉用户与模型之间的复杂交互，且受限于稀疏、噪声多、格式不一致的用户偏好数据，无法有效进行个性化推荐。

Method: 将多轮用户-LLM交互表示为包含用户、LLM、查询和响应四类节点的异构图，设计了一种轻量级的归纳图学习框架和定制的消息传递机制，利用少量样本数据学习用户偏好。

Result: 在多个数据集上实验表明，GMTRouter比强基线方法准确率提高0.9%到21.6%，AUC提升0.006至0.309，并能仅用少量数据适应新用户和动态变化的偏好。

Conclusion: GMTRouter通过异构图建模和轻量级归纳学习，实现了高效、可扩展的个性化LLM路由，解决了用户偏好数据稀缺下的个性化建模难题。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) routing has demonstrated strong capability in balancing response quality with computational cost. As users exhibit diverse preferences, personalization has attracted increasing attention in LLM routing, since even identical queries may require different models to generate responses tailored to individual needs. However, existing approaches are not fully personalized and often fail to capture the complex interactions between specific users and LLMs. Moreover, user preference data is typically scarce, noisy, and inconsistent in format, which limits the effectiveness of methods that rely solely on user-specific data. To address these challenges, we propose GMTRouter, which represents multi-turn user-LLM interactions as a heterogeneous graph with four node types: user, LLM, query, and response, thereby preserving the rich relational structure of the interaction. Through a tailored message-passing mechanism, GMTRouter learns to capture user preferences from few-shot data within a lightweight inductive graph learning framework, enabling effective personalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMTRouter consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving 0.9 to 21.6 percent higher accuracy and 0.006 to 0.309 higher AUC across multiple datasets. More importantly, we demonstrate that GMTRouter can adapt to new users and evolving preferences using only few-shot data, without extensive fine-tuning. The code for GMTRouter is publicly available at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/GMTRouter.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证大语言模型在模拟在线社区和社交媒体互动中的有效性，并探讨其在内容推荐算法测试、政策影响评估等方面的应用潜力。

Method: 从Reddit收集真实人类对话，并使用Llama 3 70B和GPT-4o两个大语言模型生成相同主题的虚拟对话，随后让参与者对比判断对话来源。

Result: LLM生成的对话中有39%被误认为是人类创作；尤其是Llama 3生成的对话，参与者仅56%的概率能正确识别为AI生成，接近随机猜测。

Conclusion: 大语言模型能够生成足够逼真的社交媒体对话，在社交模拟中具有应用前景，但也警示了其可能被用于制造虚假社交内容的风险。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new avenues to simulate online communities and social media. Potential applications range from testing the design of content recommendation algorithms to estimating the effects of content policies and interventions. However, the validity of using LLMs to simulate conversations between various users remains largely untested. We evaluated whether LLMs can convincingly mimic human group conversations on social media. We collected authentic human conversations from Reddit and generated artificial conversations on the same topic with two LLMs: Llama 3 70B and GPT-4o. When presented side-by-side to study participants, LLM-generated conversations were mistaken for human-created content 39\% of the time. In particular, when evaluating conversations generated by Llama 3, participants correctly identified them as AI-generated only 56\% of the time, barely better than random chance. Our study demonstrates that LLMs can generate social media conversations sufficiently realistic to deceive humans when reading them, highlighting both a promising potential for social simulation and a warning message about the potential misuse of LLMs to generate new inauthentic social media content.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了大语言模型（LLM）在解读美国法典第18编第175条（生物武器相关法律）中的潜力与风险，提出结合知识图谱与检索增强生成（RAG）的方法来评估LLM对法律的理解、意图识别能力及安全性。实验显示LLM在推理和安全机制上存在显著缺陷，但通过改进的安全协议和法律推理框架，可为LLM在敏感法律领域的安全应用提供基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在法律分析中具有潜力，但其可能生成危险内容（如制造生物武器的指导），存在严重安全隐患。需要系统方法评估其法律理解与安全边界。

Method: 构建知识图谱并结合检索增强生成（RAG）技术，设计实验评估LLM在识别违法行为、生成禁令指令和判断非法意图方面的能力。

Result: 发现LLM在法律推理和安全控制方面存在明显不足，容易生成违规内容，且难以准确判断法律意图。

Conclusion: 通过整合更强的安全机制和法律推理框架，可以提升LLM在敏感法律领域应用的安全性，使其成为守法的助手而非违法的帮凶。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers transformative potential for interpreting complex legal frameworks, such as Title 18 Section 175 of the US Code, which governs biological weapons. These systems hold promise for advancing legal analysis and compliance monitoring in sensitive domains. However, this capability comes with a troubling contradiction: while LLMs can analyze and interpret laws, they also demonstrate alarming vulnerabilities in generating unsafe outputs, such as actionable steps for bioweapon creation, despite their safeguards. To address this challenge, we propose a methodology that integrates knowledge graph construction with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to systematically evaluate LLMs' understanding of this law, their capacity to assess legal intent (mens rea), and their potential for unsafe applications. Through structured experiments, we assess their accuracy in identifying legal violations, generating prohibited instructions, and detecting unlawful intent in bioweapons-related scenarios. Our findings reveal significant limitations in LLMs' reasoning and safety mechanisms, but they also point the way forward. By combining enhanced safety protocols with more robust legal reasoning frameworks, this research lays the groundwork for developing LLMs that can ethically and securely assist in sensitive legal domains - ensuring they act as protectors of the law rather than inadvertent enablers of its violation.

Conclusion: Bi-RAR通过双向评估和多目标优化显著提升了复杂推理场景下的检索增强生成性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven to be effective in mitigating hallucinations in large language models, yet its effectiveness remains limited in complex, multi-step reasoning scenarios.Recent efforts have incorporated search-based interactions into RAG, enabling iterative reasoning with real-time retrieval. Most approaches rely on outcome-based supervision, offering no explicit guidance for intermediate steps. This often leads to reward hacking and degraded response quality. We propose Bi-RAR, a novel retrieval-augmented reasoning framework that evaluates each intermediate step jointly in both forward and backward directions. To assess the information completeness of each step, we introduce a bidirectional information distance grounded in Kolmogorov complexity, approximated via language model generation probabilities. This quantification measures both how far the current reasoning is from the answer and how well it addresses the question. To optimize reasoning under these bidirectional signals, we adopt a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework with a cascading reward structure that emphasizes early trajectory alignment. Empirical results on seven question answering benchmarks demonstrate that Bi-RAR surpasses previous methods and enables efficient interaction and reasoning with the search engine during training and inference.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Soft Preference Learning的新方法，用于解决对齐算法（如RLHF和DPO）导致大语言模型输出多样性下降的问题。该方法通过解耦KL散度正则项中的熵与交叉熵，实现对生成多样性的精细控制，在保持对齐的同时提升语义、词汇多样性和社会观点表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对齐算法（如RLHF和DPO）使用KL散度正则化，导致模型过度偏向主流观点，抑制少数意见和输出多样性，限制了LLM在多视角表达和社会包容性方面的能力。

Method: 提出Soft Preference Learning，将偏好学习中KL惩罚项的熵和交叉熵部分解耦，从而独立调控模型输出的多样性与准确性，实现更灵活的生成控制。

Result: 采用Soft Preference Learning训练的LLM在困难的重复采样任务上准确率更高，生成文本具有更高的语义和词汇多样性，能表达更广泛的社会观点，并表现出更好的logit校准性能。此外，该方法优于标准的温度缩放技术。

Conclusion: Soft Preference Learning在不牺牲对齐效果的前提下，有效提升了LLM输出的多样性与表达能力，是对现有偏好学习算法的帕累托改进，有助于构建更具包容性和鲁棒性的语言模型。

Abstract: The ability of LLMs to represent diverse perspectives is critical as they increasingly impact society. However, recent studies reveal that alignment algorithms such as RLHF and DPO significantly reduce the diversity of LLM outputs. Not only do aligned LLMs generate text with repetitive structure and word choice, they also approach problems in more uniform ways, and their responses reflect a narrower range of societal perspectives. We attribute this problem to the KL divergence regularizer employed in preference learning algorithms. This causes the model to systematically overweight majority opinions and sacrifice diversity in its outputs. To address this, we propose Soft Preference Learning, which decouples the entropy and cross-entropy terms in the KL penalty - allowing for fine-grained control over LLM generation diversity. From a capabilities perspective, LLMs trained using Soft Preference Learning attain higher accuracy on difficult repeated sampling tasks and produce outputs with greater semantic and lexical diversity. From an alignment perspective, they are capable of representing a wider range of societal viewpoints and display improved logit calibration. Notably, Soft Preference Learning resembles, but is a Pareto improvement over, standard temperature scaling.

Abstract: Bangladesh's low-income population faces major barriers to affordable legal advice due to complex legal language, procedural opacity, and high costs. Existing AI legal assistants lack Bengali-language support and jurisdiction-specific adaptation, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we developed Mina, a multilingual LLM-based legal assistant tailored for the Bangladeshi context. It employs multilingual embeddings and a RAG-based chain-of-tools framework for retrieval, reasoning, translation, and document generation, delivering context-aware legal drafts, citations, and plain-language explanations via an interactive chat interface.

Motivation: Tree-of-Thought（ToT）虽然提升了大模型的推理能力，但存在计算开销大、推理路径语义冗余的问题，因此需要一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Method: SSDP通过在线语义相似性计算，在并行树搜索过程中动态聚类和剪枝语义上等价的推理步骤，从而减少冗余探索。

Abstract: Tree-of-Thought (ToT) reasoning boosts the problem-solving abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) but is computationally expensive due to semantic redundancy, where distinct branches explore equivalent reasoning paths. We introduce Semantic Similarity-Based Dynamic Pruning (SSDP), a lightweight method that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first framework to integrate online semantic merging into parallelized tree search, enabling the clustering and pruning of redundant steps in real time. Across reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K and MATH500, SSDP achieves up to a 2.3x speedup over state-of-the-art tree-search baselines while maintaining competitive accuracy (typically within 5% of the strongest baseline) and reducing the number of explored nodes by 85-90%, demonstrating a practical approach to efficient, scalable LLM reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于测试大语言模型（LLM）在对抗性诱导下事实保真度的压力测试框架，通过生成和验证真假陈述来评估其幻觉倾向，实验表明不同LLM对此的敏感性差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在高风险领域因产生幻觉而影响实际部署的问题，特别是面对对抗性诱导时的事实保真能力不足。

Method: 构建三步框架：首先让LLM生成特定封闭领域内的真/假陈述；然后要求其验证这些陈述的真假；最后测试其对自身生成并验证为假的陈述的鲁棒性。

Result: 在电影和小说两个封闭领域对五种主流闭源LLM进行评估发现，Claude表现出强韧性，GPT和Grok中等，Gemini和DeepSeek较弱。

Conclusion: 当前主流大语言模型在面对自身生成的虚假信息时存在不同程度的脆弱性，这对依赖LLM获取信息的用户构成潜在风险，亟需改进其事实一致性。

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a critical challenge to the real-world deployment of large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains. In this paper, we present a framework for stress testing factual fidelity in LLMs in the presence of adversarial nudge. Our framework consists of three steps. In the first step, we instruct the LLM to produce sets of truths and lies consistent with the closed domain in question. In the next step, we instruct the LLM to verify the same set of assertions as truths and lies consistent with the same closed domain. In the final step, we test the robustness of the LLM against the lies generated (and verified) by itself. Our extensive evaluation, conducted using five widely known proprietary LLMs across two closed domains of popular movies and novels, reveals a wide range of susceptibility to adversarial nudges: \texttt{Claude} exhibits strong resilience, \texttt{GPT} and \texttt{Grok} demonstrate moderate resilience, while \texttt{Gemini} and \texttt{DeepSeek} show weak resilience. Considering that a large population is increasingly using LLMs for information seeking, our findings raise alarm.

### [79] [Self-HarmLLM: Can Large Language Model Harm Itself?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08597)
*Heehwan Kim,Sungjune Park,Daeseon Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了Self-HarmLLM场景，探讨大语言模型自身输出可能成为新的攻击向量的问题，实验表明在Zero-shot和Few-shot条件下可实现高达65%的转换成功率和41%的越狱成功率，揭示了现有防护机制和自动化评估方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御机制通常假设攻击来自外部输入，而忽略了模型自身生成的输出可能演变为有害查询的风险。本文旨在探索这一被忽视的攻击路径，即模型先前生成的缓和有害查询（MHQ）再次作为输入时是否会导致越狱。

Method: 提出Self-HarmLLM框架，利用同一模型生成具有隐藏有害意图的模糊查询（MHQ），并在新会话中将其重新输入以测试是否触发越狱。在GPT-3.5-turbo、LLaMA3-8B-instruct和DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B上进行Base、Zero-shot和Few-shot实验，并结合基于前缀的自动评估与人工评估对比结果。

Result: 实验结果显示，在Zero-shot条件下最高达52%的转换成功率和33%的越狱成功率；Few-shot条件下分别达到65%和41%。自动评估相比人工评估显著高估了越狱成功率，平均偏差达52%，说明其可靠性有限。

Conclusion: 模型自身输出可构成潜在攻击向量，当前防护机制存在盲区。研究证明需重新审视守则设计原则，并建立更可靠的多维度评估体系，尤其应减少对自动化评估的依赖。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are generally equipped with guardrails to block the generation of harmful responses. However, existing defenses always assume that an external attacker crafts the harmful query, and the possibility of a model's own output becoming a new attack vector has not been sufficiently explored. In this study, we propose the Self-HarmLLM scenario, which uses a Mitigated Harmful Query (MHQ) generated by the same model as a new input. An MHQ is an ambiguous query whose original intent is preserved while its harmful nature is not directly exposed. We verified whether a jailbreak occurs when this MHQ is re-entered into a separate session of the same model. We conducted experiments on GPT-3.5-turbo, LLaMA3-8B-instruct, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B under Base, Zero-shot, and Few-shot conditions. The results showed up to 52% transformation success rate and up to 33% jailbreak success rate in the Zero-shot condition, and up to 65% transformation success rate and up to 41% jailbreak success rate in the Few-shot condition. By performing both prefix-based automated evaluation and human evaluation, we found that the automated evaluation consistently overestimated jailbreak success, with an average difference of 52%. This indicates that automated evaluation alone is not accurate for determining harmfulness. While this study is a toy-level study based on a limited query set and evaluators, it proves that our method can still be a valid attack scenario. These results suggest the need for a fundamental reconsideration of guardrail design and the establishment of a more robust evaluation methodology.

*Yanhong Li,Tianyang Xu,Kenan Tang,Karen Livescu,David McAllester,Jiawei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出OKBench，一个全自动化的动态知识基准生成框架，用于评估大语言模型在不断更新的知识环境下的问答能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态基准无法反映知识的动态变化，且集中式维护难以跟上大模型发展速度。

Method: 构建基于新闻领域的代理式框架OKBench，自动化完成数据源获取、题目生成、验证与分发，并支持检索增强方法的评估。

Result: 在多类开源与闭源大模型上验证表明，新基准能揭示模型对新知识的响应差异，检索显著缩小大小模型性能差距。

Conclusion: 动态、可自动扩展的知识基准对评估大模型的真实知识理解能力至关重要。

Abstract: Knowledge-intensive question answering is central to large language models (LLMs) and is typically assessed using static benchmarks derived from sources like Wikipedia and textbooks. However, these benchmarks fail to capture evolving knowledge in a dynamic world, and centralized curation struggles to keep pace with rapid LLM advancements. To address these drawbacks, we propose Open Knowledge Bench (OKBench), a fully automated framework for generating high-quality, dynamic knowledge benchmarks on demand. Focusing on the news domain where knowledge updates daily, OKBench is an agentic framework that automates the sourcing, creation, validation, and distribution of benchmarks. Our approach democratizes benchmark creation and facilitates thorough evaluation of retrieval-augmented methods by reducing overlap with pretraining data. We evaluate our framework on a wide range open-source and proprietary LLMs of various sizes and configurations, both with and without retrieval over freshly generated knowledge. Our results reveal distinct model behaviors when confronted with new information and highlight how retrieval narrows the performance gap between small and large models. These findings underscore the importance of evaluating LLMs on evolving knowledge benchmarks.

*Yilan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种结合检索增强生成（RAG）与领域知识库的系统，用于自动生成儿科言语语言病理学（SLP）临床案例，验证了该方法在多种大语言模型上的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动创建SLP临床案例耗时且费力，通用大模型易产生幻觉，缺乏专业性，因此需要一种能结合领域知识、减少专家修订负担的自动化生成方法。

Method: 构建了一个多模型RAG系统，整合精选的领域知识库和设计好的提示模板，测试了五个商用和开源大语言模型，在七种不同障碍类型和年级水平的情景下生成案例，并通过多维度评分标准进行自动质量评估。

Result: 所有模型均能生成结构完整、符合临床规范的案例，商用模型略优，但开源模型表现亦可接受；知识库的引入有效减少了幻觉，提升了内容的专业性和一致性。

Conclusion: RAG结合领域知识库的方法在生成儿科SLP案例方面具有技术可行性，支持未来在教育和临床中的应用，但仍需专家评审和心理测量验证，未来可拓展至IEP目标生成和临床决策支持。

Abstract: Clinical vignettes are essential educational tools in speech-language pathology (SLP), but manual creation is time-intensive. While general-purpose large language models (LLMs) can generate text, they lack domain-specific knowledge, leading to hallucinations and requiring extensive expert revision. This study presents a proof-of-concept system integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with curated knowledge bases to generate pediatric SLP case materials. A multi-model RAG-based system was prototyped integrating curated domain knowledge with engineered prompt templates, supporting five commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro) and open-source (Llama 3.2, Qwen 2.5-7B) LLMs. Seven test scenarios spanning diverse disorder types and grade levels were systematically designed. Generated cases underwent automated quality assessment using a multi-dimensional rubric evaluating structural completeness, internal consistency, clinical appropriateness, and IEP goal/session note quality. This proof-of-concept demonstrates technical feasibility for RAG-augmented generation of pediatric SLP vignettes. Commercial models showed marginal quality advantages, but open-source alternatives achieved acceptable performance, suggesting potential for privacy-preserving institutional deployment. Integration of curated knowledge bases enabled content generation aligned with professional guidelines. Extensive validation through expert review, student pilot testing, and psychometric evaluation is required before educational or research implementation. Future applications may extend to clinical decision support, automated IEP goal generation, and clinical reflection training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文将DisCoCirc框架扩展至孟加拉语，并用于英-孟翻译任务，发现该框架在处理语言结构差异时存在局限性，尤其在简单句子上仍表现不佳，挑战了先前研究的结论，同时探讨了英语连词与布尔逻辑的联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新评估DisCoCirc在减少语言官僚化方面的有效性，并将其应用于结构差异较大的语言对（如英语和孟加拉语）的翻译任务。

Method: 基于DisCoCirc形式化框架，结合语法生成规则和电路式表示，构建适用于孟加拉语的模型，并应用于英-孟双向翻译；同时分析英语连词与布尔逻辑的关系。

Result: DisCoCirc在处理英语和孟加拉语翻译时表现出一定能力，但在应对语言结构差异方面存在明显局限，即使在简单句子上也表现不佳；此外揭示了英语连词与布尔逻辑之间的关联。

Conclusion: DisCoCirc虽具潜力，但受限于跨语言结构差异，其有效性被高估，未来需改进以适应更多语言；同时为自然语言中的逻辑结构提供了新视角。

Abstract: In [4], the authors present the DisCoCirc (Distributed Compositional Circuits) formalism for the English language, a grammar-based framework derived from the production rules that incorporates circuit-like representations in order to give a precise categorical theoretical structure to the language. In this paper, we extend this approach to develop a similar framework for Bengali and apply it to translation tasks between English and Bengali. A central focus of our work lies in reassessing the effectiveness of DisCoCirc in reducing language bureaucracy. Unlike the result suggested in [5], our findings indicate that although it works well for a large part of the language, it still faces limitations due to the structural variation of the two languages. We discuss the possible methods that might handle these shortcomings and show that, in practice, DisCoCirc still struggles even with relatively simple sentences. This divergence from prior claims not only highlights the framework's constraints in translation but also suggest scope for future improvement. Apart from our primary focus on English-Bengali translation, we also take a short detour to examine English conjunctions, following [1], showing a connection between conjunctions and Boolean logic.

Motivation: 为了提升急诊环境中医疗决策支持系统的诊断准确性，探索大语言模型在急性疾病诊断中的潜力，并克服单一模型性能有限的问题。

Method: 研究比较了五种主流大语言模型（Gemini、Llama、Grok、GPT、Claude）在真实急诊病例中的诊断表现，并构建了一个基于元学习的超级学习者系统（MEDAS），通过整合多个LLM的输出以提升整体诊断准确率。

Result: 五种LLM的诊断准确率为58%–65%，均高于人类医生的报告水平；MEDAS超级学习者系统达到70%的准确率，而其中某一LLM在特定情况下可达85%。集成方法的准确率高于任一单独模型。

Conclusion: 通过元学习集成多个大语言模型可显著提升急诊诊断的准确性，MEDAS系统展示了多模型协作在医疗决策支持中的巨大潜力，未来有望成为辅助医生的重要工具。

Abstract: Medical decision-support and advising systems are critical for emergency physicians to quickly and accurately assess patients' conditions and make diagnosis. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force in healthcare in recent years and Large Language Models (LLMs) have been employed in various fields of medical decision-support systems. We studied responses of a group of different LLMs to real cases in emergency medicine. The results of our study on five most renown LLMs showed significant differences in capabilities of Large Language Models for diagnostics acute diseases in medical emergencies with accuracy ranging between 58% and 65%. This accuracy significantly exceeds the reported accuracy of human doctors. We built a super-learner MEDAS (Medical Emergency Diagnostic Advising System) of five major LLMs - Gemini, Llama, Grok, GPT, and Claude). The super-learner produces higher diagnostic accuracy, 70%, even with a quite basic meta-learner. However, at least one of the integrated LLMs in the same super-learner produces 85% correct diagnoses. The super-learner integrates a cluster of LLMs using a meta-learner capable of learning different capabilities of each LLM to leverage diagnostic accuracy of the model by collective capabilities of all LLMs in the cluster. The results of our study showed that aggregated diagnostic accuracy provided by a meta-learning approach exceeds that of any individual LLM, suggesting that the super-learner can take advantage of the combined knowledge of the medical datasets used to train the group of LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出一种自适应梯度感知数据选择方法GrADS，用于大语言模型的监督微调，通过分析梯度信息筛选高效训练子集，在仅用5%数据时即超越全数据微调的效果，并显著缓解灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调（SFT）在领域专业化中至关重要，但资源消耗大且易导致灾难性遗忘，需更高效的数据选择策略。

Method: 设计基于梯度幅值和统计分布的自指导准则，在初步训练后分析梯度以识别对学习贡献最大的样本，进行数据子集选择。

Result: 在医学、法律、金融等多个领域实验表明，使用5%的GrADS选样数据即可超越全数据微调性能，50%数据时提升显著，同时有效缓解灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: GrADS能高效提升LLM领域适应能力，大幅降低微调成本与资源消耗，兼具性能增益与稳定性。

Abstract: Despite large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive achievements across numerous tasks, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) remains essential for adapting these models to specialized domains. However, SFT for domain specialization can be resource-intensive and sometimes leads to a deterioration in performance over general capabilities due to catastrophic forgetting (CF). To address these issues, we propose a self-adaptive gradient-aware data selection approach (GrADS) for supervised fine-tuning of LLMs, which identifies effective subsets of training data by analyzing gradients obtained from a preliminary training phase. Specifically, we design self-guided criteria that leverage the magnitude and statistical distribution of gradients to prioritize examples that contribute the most to the model's learning process. This approach enables the acquisition of representative samples that enhance LLMs understanding of domain-specific tasks. Through extensive experimentation with various LLMs across diverse domains such as medicine, law, and finance, GrADS has demonstrated significant efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Remarkably, utilizing merely 5% of the selected GrADS data, LLMs already surpass the performance of those fine-tuned on the entire dataset, and increasing to 50% of the data results in significant improvements! With catastrophic forgetting substantially mitigated simultaneously. We will release our code for GrADS later.

Motivation: 自杀是青少年第二大死因，既往自杀尝试是未来自杀的重要预测因素，而许多有自杀倾向者会在社交媒体上表达意图，因此亟需有效工具进行早期识别。

Method: 提出一种融合CNN和BiGRU的混合深度学习框架，结合注意力机制和SHAP可解释性方法，用于从社交媒体数据中检测自杀意念。

Result: 在公开数据集上训练和评估，模型准确率达到93.97%，优于现有的机器学习和深度学习方法。

Conclusion: 该混合模型在自杀意念检测方面表现优越，具备高准确性和可解释性，有助于社交媒体中的心理健康干预。

Abstract: Worldwide, suicide is the second leading cause of death for adolescents with past suicide attempts to be an important predictor for increased future suicides. While some people with suicidal thoughts may try to suppress them, many signal their intentions in social media platforms. To address these issues, we propose a new type of hybrid deep learning scheme, i.e., the combination of a CNN architecture and a BiGRU technique, which can accurately identify the patterns of suicidal ideation from SN datasets. Also, we apply Explainable AI methods using SHapley Additive exPlanations to interpret the prediction results and verifying the model reliability. This integration of CNN local feature extraction, BiGRU bidirectional sequence modeling, attention mechanisms, and SHAP interpretability provides a comprehensive framework for suicide detection. Training and evaluation of the system were performed on a publicly available dataset. Several performance metrics were used for evaluating model performance. Our method was found to have achieved 93.97 accuracy in experimental results. Comparative study to different state-of-the-art Machine Learning and DL models and existing literature demonstrates the superiority of our proposed technique over all the competing methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于结构化不确定性的方法（SAGE-Agent），用于提升LLM代理在模糊指令下的工具调用准确性，通过POMDP建模和EVPI目标优化澄清问题选择，在多领域任务中显著提高任务覆盖率并减少冗余提问。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模糊的用户指令常导致LLM代理错误调用工具，影响任务成功率，因此需要一种系统性方法来建模和处理工具参数中的不确定性。

Method: 将工具-参数的联合澄清建模为部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程（POMDP），采用期望完美信息价值（EVPI）作为目标函数进行最优提问选择，并引入基于方面的成本模型避免冗余；同时利用结构化不确定性为强化学习提供加权训练信号。

Result: SAGE-Agent在ClarifyBench基准上将模糊任务的覆盖范围提高了7-39%，同时减少1.5-2.7倍的澄清问题；通过不确定性加权GRPO训练，When2Call准确率从约36%提升至65%（3B模型）和62.9%（7B模型）。

Conclusion: 结构化不确定性是一种原则性强且高效的方法，能显著提升工具增强型代理在现实场景中的任务成功率与交互效率。

Abstract: LLM agents extend large language models with tool-calling capabilities, but ambiguous user instructions often lead to incorrect invocations and task failures. We introduce a principled formulation of structured uncertainty over tool-call parameters, modeling joint tool-argument clarification as a POMDP with Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI) objective for optimal question selection and aspect-based cost modeling to prevent redundancy. Our SAGE-Agent leverages this structured uncertainty to achieve superior efficiency: increasing coverage on ambiguous tasks by 7-39\% while reducing clarification questions by 1.5-2.7$\times$ compared to strong prompting and uncertainty-based baselines. We present ClarifyBench, the first multi-turn tool-augmented disambiguation benchmark with realistic LLM-based user simulation across diverse domains including document editing, vehicle control, and travel booking. Additionally, we demonstrate that structured uncertainty provides effective training signals for reinforcement learning, boosting When2Call accuracy from 36.5\% to 65.2\% (3B model) and 36.7\% to 62.9\% (7B model) through uncertainty-weighted GRPO training. These results establish structured uncertainty as a principled, efficient approach for tool-augmented agents, improving both task success and interaction efficiency in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 本研究开发并评估了三种自然语言处理模型，用于从帕金森病患者的自述中自动识别认知过程类别，发现微调后的Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct模型整体表现最佳，表明NLP技术有望辅助长期监测认知功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解帕金森病患者日常生活中描述的认知体验有助于揭示疾病相关的认知与情绪变化，但因认知概念的隐晦性和重叠性，从非结构化叙述中提取信息具有挑战性。

Method: 比较了三种模型：基于Bio_ClinicalBERT的跨度分类模型、使用QLoRA微调的Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct模型，以及在零样本和少样本设置下评估的GPT-4o mini，用于提取七类认知相关类别。

Result: 微调后的Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct模型取得最高F1分数（micro-average 0.74，macro-average 0.59），尤其在‘思维’和‘社交互动’等依赖上下文的类别上表现优异；Bio_ClinicalBERT精度高但召回率低，且在某些类别上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 尽管该任务因认知过程的抽象性和重叠性而极具挑战，但结果表明NLP系统经进一步优化后，有望实现低负担的长期认知功能监测，并作为帕金森病神经心理评估的有效补充。

Abstract: Understanding how individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) describe cognitive experiences in their daily lives can offer valuable insights into disease-related cognitive and emotional changes. However, extracting such information from unstructured patient narratives is challenging due to the subtle, overlapping nature of cognitive constructs. This study developed and evaluated natural language processing (NLP) models to automatically identify categories that reflect various cognitive processes from de-identified first-person narratives. Three model families, a Bio_ClinicalBERT-based span categorization model for nested entity recognition, a fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct model using QLoRA for instruction following, and GPT-4o mini evaluated under zero- and few-shot settings, were compared on their performance on extracting seven categories. Our findings indicated that model performance varied substantially across categories and model families. The fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct achieved the highest overall F1-scores (0.74 micro-average and 0.59 macro-average), particularly excelling in context-dependent categories such as thought and social interaction. Bio_ClinicalBERT exhibited high precision but low recall and performed comparable to Llama for some category types such as location and time but failed on other categories such as thought, emotion and social interaction. Compared to conventional information extraction tasks, this task presents a greater challenge due to the abstract and overlapping nature of narrative accounts of complex cognitive processes. Nonetheless, with continued refinement, these NLP systems hold promise for enabling low-burden, longitudinal monitoring of cognitive function and serving as a valuable complement to formal neuropsychological assessments in PD.

Motivation: 现有的孟加拉语NLI数据集存在标注错误、模糊句子对和语言多样性不足等问题，限制了模型的有效训练与评估，因此需要一个更高质量的数据集来推动孟加拉语的语言理解研究。

Method: 通过严格的标注流程构建BNLI数据集，强调语义清晰性和三类（蕴含、矛盾、中立）之间的平衡，并使用多种先进的基于transformer的多语言及孟加拉语专用模型进行基准测试。

Result: 实验结果表明，BNLI具有更高的可靠性和可解释性，能够有效支持孟加拉语的语义关系建模，且在各类模型上表现出良好的评估性能。

Conclusion: BNLI为孟加拉语及其他低资源语言的自然语言推断研究提供了一个坚实的基础，有助于推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Despite the growing progress in Natural Language Inference (NLI) research, resources for the Bengali language remain extremely limited. Existing Bengali NLI datasets exhibit several inconsistencies, including annotation errors, ambiguous sentence pairs, and inadequate linguistic diversity, which hinder effective model training and evaluation. To address these limitations, we introduce BNLI, a refined and linguistically curated Bengali NLI dataset designed to support robust language understanding and inference modeling. The dataset was constructed through a rigorous annotation pipeline emphasizing semantic clarity and balance across entailment, contradiction, and neutrality classes. We benchmarked BNLI using a suite of state-of-the-art transformer-based architectures, including multilingual and Bengali-specific models, to assess their ability to capture complex semantic relations in Bengali text. The experimental findings highlight the improved reliability and interpretability achieved with BNLI, establishing it as a strong foundation for advancing research in Bengali and other low-resource language inference tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了TACT数据集，用于建模任务导向与闲聊之间的对话模式转换，并引入Switch和Recovery两个新指标来评估模型的模式切换能力。实验表明，结合Direct Preference Optimization（DPO）的模型在意图识别和模式转换上表现优异，显著提升了对话系统的过渡控制能力和响应质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对话系统通常局限于任务导向或开放闲聊，难以实现两者间的自然切换。而真实对话中常包含两种模式的动态转换，因此需要能处理模式迁移的统一模型。

Method: 构建了一个名为TACT的数据集，包含多样化的任务导向与闲聊之间的结构化转换流程，并支持用户和代理驱动的模式切换；提出Switch和Recovery两个新评估指标；采用DPO对模型进行优化以提升性能。

Result: 在TACT上训练的模型优于基线模型，在联合模式-意图识别上达到75.74%的准确率；经DPO优化后，在人类评估中对GPT-4o的胜率达70.1%。

Conclusion: 结构多样的数据结合DPO能够有效提升对话系统在模式切换中的表现，推动更主动、过渡感知更强的对话代理的发展。

Abstract: Conversational agents have traditionally been developed for either task-oriented dialogue (TOD) or open-ended chitchat, with limited progress in unifying the two. Yet, real-world conversations naturally involve fluid transitions between these modes. To address this gap, we introduce TACT (TOD-And-Chitchat Transition), a dataset designed for transition-aware dialogue modeling that incorporates structurally diverse and integrated mode flows. TACT supports both user- and agent-driven mode switches, enabling robust modeling of complex conversational dynamics. To evaluate an agent's ability to initiate and recover from mode transitions, we propose two new metrics -- Switch and Recovery. Models trained on TACT outperform baselines in both intent detection and mode transition handling. Moreover, applying Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to TACT-trained models yields additional gains, achieving 75.74\% joint mode-intent accuracy and a 70.1\% win rate against GPT-4o in human evaluation. These results demonstrate that pairing structurally diverse data with DPO enhances response quality and transition control, paving the way for more proactive and transition-aware conversational agents.

Abstract: Hypothesis generation in biomedical research has traditionally centered on uncovering hidden relationships within vast scientific literature, often using methods like Literature-Based Discovery (LBD). Despite progress, current approaches typically depend on single data types or predefined extraction patterns, which restricts the discovery of novel and complex connections. Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) agents show significant potential, with capabilities in information retrieval, reasoning, and generation. However, their application to biomedical hypothesis generation has been limited by the absence of standardized datasets and execution environments. To address this, we introduce BioVerge, a comprehensive benchmark, and BioVerge Agent, an LLM-based agent framework, to create a standardized environment for exploring biomedical hypothesis generation at the frontier of existing scientific knowledge. Our dataset includes structured and textual data derived from historical biomedical hypotheses and PubMed literature, organized to support exploration by LLM agents. BioVerge Agent utilizes a ReAct-based approach with distinct Generation and Evaluation modules that iteratively produce and self-assess hypothesis proposals. Through extensive experimentation, we uncover key insights: 1) different architectures of BioVerge Agent influence exploration diversity and reasoning strategies; 2) structured and textual information sources each provide unique, critical contexts that enhance hypothesis generation; and 3) self-evaluation significantly improves the novelty and relevance of proposed hypotheses.

### [91] [Hallucinate or Memorize? The Two Sides of Probabilistic Learning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08877)
*Junichiro Niimi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了大语言模型（LLM）在生成参考文献时的幻觉问题，发现引用次数越多的论文越容易被准确生成，表明高频引用文献的知识更可能被模型记忆而非生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在引文推荐中产生虚构文献的问题，探究知识是源于生成还是记忆。

Method: 使用GPT-4.1生成100个跨20个计算机科学领域的引文，并通过人工验证和余弦相似度评估生成元数据与真实数据的一致性。

Result: 引用次数与事实准确性显著相关；超过约1000次引用后，文献信息几乎被逐字记忆；当多篇高引论文内容相似时会出现记忆干扰。

Conclusion: 存在一个从泛化到记忆的阈值，高被引论文的知识在模型中接近于被完全记住，而非推理生成。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to a wide range of tasks, from natural language understanding to code generation. While they have also been used to assist in citation recommendation, the hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce bibliographic records depends on whether the underlying knowledge is generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear in the pretraining corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency with which a given bibliographic record appears in the pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified 100 citations across twenty computer-science domains, and measured factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic metadata. The results revealed that (i) citation count is strongly correlated with factual accuracy, (ii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatim memorized beyond roughly 1,000 citations, and (iii) memory interference occurs when multiple highly cited papers share similar content. These findings indicate a threshold where generalization shifts into memorization, with highly cited papers being nearly verbatim retained in the model.

*Yaxin Zhao,Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级、任务无关的框架HalluClean，用于检测和纠正大语言模型生成文本中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然在多种自然语言处理任务中表现优异，但常产生幻觉内容，影响事实可靠性，亟需无需外部知识或监督训练的通用解决方案。

Method: 采用推理增强范式，将过程分解为规划、执行和修订三个阶段，利用最小任务路由提示实现跨领域的零样本泛化。

Result: 在问答、对话、摘要、数学应用题和矛盾检测五个任务上实验表明，HalluClean显著提升了事实一致性，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: HalluClean能有效检测和纠正LLM生成文本中的幻觉，提升输出可信度，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks, yet they often produce hallucinated content that undermines factual reliability. To address this challenge, we introduce HalluClean, a lightweight and task-agnostic framework for detecting and correcting hallucinations in LLM-generated text. HalluClean adopts a reasoning-enhanced paradigm, explicitly decomposing the process into planning, execution, and revision stages to identify and refine unsupported claims. It employs minimal task-routing prompts to enable zero-shot generalization across diverse domains, without relying on external knowledge sources or supervised detectors. We conduct extensive evaluations on five representative tasks-question answering, dialogue, summarization, math word problems, and contradiction detection. Experimental results show that HalluClean significantly improves factual consistency and outperforms competitive baselines, demonstrating its potential to enhance the trustworthiness of LLM outputs in real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TiDAR是一种新型混合架构，通过在单次前向传播中结合扩散式草拟和自回归式生成，在保持自回归模型质量的同时大幅提升生成速度，实现了高效且高质量的文本生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以在自回归模型的质量和扩散模型的并行生成效率之间取得良好平衡，TiDAR旨在实现高吞吐、高GPU利用率与自回归级别生成质量的协同。

Method: 提出TiDAR架构，采用结构化注意力机制，在同一前向传播中先用扩散模型草拟候选序列（Thinking），再以自回归方式生成最终输出（Talking），并支持精确的KV缓存复用。

Result: 在1.5B和8B规模上，TiDAR在吞吐量上优于推测解码，并在效率和质量上超越Dream、Llada等扩散模型；首次在不牺牲质量的前提下，实现比自回归模型高出4.71x至5.91x的生成速度。

Conclusion: TiDAR成功融合了扩散模型的并行性和自回归模型的高质量优势，是首个在生成质量与自回归模型相当的同时显著提升推理效率的架构，具备良好的服务部署友好性。

Abstract: Diffusion language models hold the promise of fast parallel generation, while autoregressive (AR) models typically excel in quality due to their causal structure aligning naturally with language modeling. This raises a fundamental question: can we achieve a synergy with high throughput, higher GPU utilization, and AR level quality? Existing methods fail to effectively balance these two aspects, either prioritizing AR using a weaker model for sequential drafting (speculative decoding), leading to lower drafting efficiency, or using some form of left-to-right (AR-like) decoding logic for diffusion, which still suffers from quality degradation and forfeits its potential parallelizability. We introduce TiDAR, a sequence-level hybrid architecture that drafts tokens (Thinking) in Diffusion and samples final outputs (Talking) AutoRegressively - all within a single forward pass using specially designed structured attention masks. This design exploits the free GPU compute density, achieving a strong balance between drafting and verification capacity. Moreover, TiDAR is designed to be serving-friendly (low overhead) as a standalone model. We extensively evaluate TiDAR against AR models, speculative decoding, and diffusion variants across generative and likelihood tasks at 1.5B and 8B scales. Thanks to the parallel drafting and sampling as well as exact KV cache support, TiDAR outperforms speculative decoding in measured throughput and surpasses diffusion models like Dream and Llada in both efficiency and quality. Most notably, TiDAR is the first architecture to close the quality gap with AR models while delivering 4.71x to 5.91x more tokens per second.

### [94] [EVADE: LLM-Based Explanation Generation and Validation for Error Detection in NLI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08949)
*Longfei Zuo,Barbara Plank,Siyao Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为EVADE的新框架，利用大语言模型（LLMs）生成和验证解释以检测自然语言推断（NLI）任务中的标注错误，在减少人工成本的同时提升了数据集质量和模型微调性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量数据集对NLP模型至关重要，但在存在人类标注变异（HLV）的情况下，难以区分标注错误与合理的标签变化。现有方法需要两轮人工标注，成本高且覆盖有限，因此需要更高效、可扩展的错误检测方法。

Method: 提出EVADE框架，使用大语言模型生成并验证标注解释，通过与人类标注的对比，从分布比较、验证重叠和微调影响三个方面评估LLM检测错误的有效性。

Result: 实验表明，LLM验证能更好对齐人类标注的解释分布，且基于LLM识别并剔除训练数据中的错误后，模型微调性能优于基于人类识别错误的去除效果。

Conclusion: LLM可用于高效、可扩展地检测标注错误，在降低人工成本的同时提升数据集质量，尤其适用于存在标注变异的任务场景。

Abstract: High-quality datasets are critical for training and evaluating reliable NLP models. In tasks like natural language inference (NLI), human label variation (HLV) arises when multiple labels are valid for the same instance, making it difficult to separate annotation errors from plausible variation. An earlier framework VARIERR (Weber-Genzel et al., 2024) asks multiple annotators to explain their label decisions in the first round and flag errors via validity judgments in the second round. However, conducting two rounds of manual annotation is costly and may limit the coverage of plausible labels or explanations. Our study proposes a new framework, EVADE, for generating and validating explanations to detect errors using large language models (LLMs). We perform a comprehensive analysis comparing human- and LLM-detected errors for NLI across distribution comparison, validation overlap, and impact on model fine-tuning. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM validation refines generated explanation distributions to more closely align with human annotations, and that removing LLM-detected errors from training data yields improvements in fine-tuning performance than removing errors identified by human annotators. This highlights the potential to scale error detection, reducing human effort while improving dataset quality under label variation.

*Shengmin Piao,Sanghyun Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SpiralThinker是一种统一的隐式推理框架，通过迭代更新潜在表征并结合对齐目标与结构化标注，实现无需生成额外token的扩展隐式推理，在数学、逻辑和常识推理任务中表现最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有潜在推理方法缺乏确保潜在表征稳定演化的机制，且无法系统地融合隐式与显式推理，限制了复杂推理能力的发展。

Method: 提出SpiralThinker框架，通过在潜在空间中进行迭代更新实现隐式推理，并引入渐进对齐目标和结构化标注来保持潜在推理与文本推理的一致性。

Result: 在多个数学、逻辑和常识推理基准上，SpiralThinker在所有潜在推理方法中取得最佳整体性能，显著超越先前方法；消融实验表明迭代和对齐均不可或缺，潜在token数和迭代次数存在数据集特定的最优值。

Conclusion: SpiralThinker成功结合了迭代计算与潜在推理，证明经过对齐的迭代更新能有效引导潜在空间中的推理过程，为提升大模型复杂推理能力提供了新路径。

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models have been driven by reinforcement learning and test-time scaling, accompanied by growing interest in latent rather than purely textual reasoning. However, existing latent reasoning methods lack mechanisms to ensure stable evolution of latent representations and a systematic way to interleave implicit and explicit reasoning. We introduce SpiralThinker, a unified framework that performs iterative updates over latent representations, enabling extended implicit reasoning without generating additional tokens. A progressive alignment objective combined with structured annotations maintains coherence between latent and textual reasoning. Across mathematical, logical, and commonsense reasoning tasks, SpiralThinker achieves the best overall performance among latent reasoning approaches, consistently surpassing previous methods across all benchmarks. Detailed analyses reveal that both iteration and alignment are indispensable, the numbers of latent tokens and iterations exhibit dataset-specific optima, and appropriate alignment proves critical for an effective iterative process. Overall, SpiralThinker bridges iterative computation and latent reasoning, demonstrating that aligned iterative updates can reliably steer reasoning in the latent space.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于用户情感轨迹的评估框架，用于衡量大语言模型在长期对话中提供情感支持的能力，引入了三个时序指标，并构建大规模基准测试来模拟真实情感变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对大语言模型情感支持能力的评估多基于短时、静态对话，难以反映情感支持的动态和长期特性，因此需要更贴近真实交互的评估方法。

Method: 采用用户中心视角，将用户情感轨迹建模为一阶马尔可夫过程，结合因果调整的情感估计来无偏追踪情绪变化；通过328个情感上下文和1152个干扰事件构建大规模基准，并约束模型使用经验证的情绪调节策略生成回应。

Result: 提出了三个轨迹级指标：基线情绪水平（BEL）、情绪轨迹波动性（ETV）和情绪质心位置（ECP），实验显示不同大语言模型在情感支持能力上存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 所提框架能有效评估大语言模型在长期对话中的情感支持表现，提供了可操作的改进方向，推动更具心理依据的AI情感交互系统发展。

Abstract: Emotional support is a core capability in human-AI interaction, with applications including psychological counseling, role play, and companionship. However, existing evaluations of large language models (LLMs) often rely on short, static dialogues and fail to capture the dynamic and long-term nature of emotional support. To overcome this limitation, we shift from snapshot-based evaluation to trajectory-based assessment, adopting a user-centered perspective that evaluates models based on their ability to improve and stabilize user emotional states over time. Our framework constructs a large-scale benchmark consisting of 328 emotional contexts and 1,152 disturbance events, simulating realistic emotional shifts under evolving dialogue scenarios. To encourage psychologically grounded responses, we constrain model outputs using validated emotion regulation strategies such as situation selection and cognitive reappraisal. User emotional trajectories are modeled as a first-order Markov process, and we apply causally-adjusted emotion estimation to obtain unbiased emotional state tracking. Based on this framework, we introduce three trajectory-level metrics: Baseline Emotional Level (BEL), Emotional Trajectory Volatility (ETV), and Emotional Centroid Position (ECP). These metrics collectively capture user emotional dynamics over time and support comprehensive evaluation of long-term emotional support performance of LLMs. Extensive evaluations across a diverse set of LLMs reveal significant disparities in emotional support capabilities and provide actionable insights for model development.

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段神经符号框架，利用大语言模型和可选的人类指导来形式化自然语言政策，并通过推理时自动形式化验证语句的逻辑正确性，实现超过99%的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的随机性限制了其在金融和医疗等严格政策监管行业中的应用，需要提高其逻辑验证的准确性和可审计性。

Method: 采用两阶段神经符号框架：第一阶段用大语言模型（可结合人工指导）将自然语言政策形式化；第二阶段在推理时进行自动形式化，通过多次冗余形式化步骤交叉验证语义等价性以确保逻辑正确性。

Result: 该方法在基准测试中实现了超过99%的可靠性，几乎为零的误报率，并生成可审计的逻辑证据支持验证结果。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了大语言模型在高风险领域中处理政策合规性任务的可靠性与透明度，具备实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models perform well at natural language interpretation and reasoning, but their inherent stochasticity limits their adoption in regulated industries like finance and healthcare that operate under strict policies. To address this limitation, we present a two-stage neurosymbolic framework that (1) uses LLMs with optional human guidance to formalize natural language policies, allowing fine-grained control of the formalization process, and (2) uses inference-time autoformalization to validate logical correctness of natural language statements against those policies. When correctness is paramount, we perform multiple redundant formalization steps at inference time, cross checking the formalizations for semantic equivalence. Our benchmarks demonstrate that our approach exceeds 99% soundness, indicating a near-zero false positive rate in identifying logical validity. Our approach produces auditable logical artifacts that substantiate the verification outcomes and can be used to improve the original text.

TL;DR: 本文提出了MM-CRITIC，一个用于评估大型多模态模型（LMMs）在多个维度上批判能力的综合基准，涵盖8种主要任务类型和超过500个任务，并通过专家指导的评分标准结合GPT-4o进行可靠评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型多模态模型在图像描述、视觉推理等任务中表现出色，但其自我批判能力的研究仍不足，缺乏系统性评估框架。

Method: 构建了一个包含基本、纠正和比较三个维度的多模态批判基准MM-CRITIC，收集了多种LMM在不同规模下的响应，并利用专家设计的评分标准指导GPT-4o生成参考批判和打分以提升评估可靠性。

Result: 实验验证了MM-CRITIC的有效性，全面评估了当前主流LMM的批判能力，揭示了回应质量与批判能力之间的相关性，并发现不同评估维度的批判难度存在差异。

Conclusion: MM-CRITIC为多模态模型的批判能力提供了可靠且系统的评估框架，有助于推动LMM向更具自我反思和改进能力的方向发展。

Abstract: The ability of critique is vital for models to self-improve and serve as reliable AI assistants. While extensively studied in language-only settings, multimodal critique of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) remains underexplored despite their growing capabilities in tasks like captioning and visual reasoning. In this work, we introduce MM-CRITIC, a holistic benchmark for evaluating the critique ability of LMMs across multiple dimensions: basic, correction, and comparison. Covering 8 main task types and over 500 tasks, MM-CRITIC collects responses from various LMMs with different model sizes and is composed of 4471 samples. To enhance the evaluation reliability, we integrate expert-informed ground answers into scoring rubrics that guide GPT-4o in annotating responses and generating reference critiques, which serve as anchors for trustworthy judgments. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of MM-CRITIC and provide a comprehensive assessment of leading LMMs' critique capabilities under multiple dimensions. Further analysis reveals some key insights, including the correlation between response quality and critique, and varying critique difficulty across evaluation dimensions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种基于混合CTC/Attention架构和上下文感知动态块机制的安多方言藏语流式语音识别框架，通过自适应调整块宽度和引入语言学词典及外部语言模型，显著降低错误率并减少延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决固定块方法在流式语音识别中上下文截断的问题，并提升安多方言藏语这种低资源、语速变化大语言的识别性能。

Method: 采用混合CTC/Attention架构，结合基于编码状态自适应调整块宽度的动态块机制；构建基于藏文正字法的词典作为建模单元；解码时融合外部语言模型以增强语义一致性。

Result: 在测试集上达到6.23%的词错误率（WER），相比固定块基线相对降低48.15%，显著减少识别延迟，性能接近全局解码。

Conclusion: 所提出的动态块机制有效缓解了上下文丢失问题，结合语言学知识和外部语言模型，实现了高效、低延迟且准确的藏语语音识别，适用于语速多变的场景。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a streaming speech recognition framework for Amdo Tibetan, built upon a hybrid CTC/Atten-tion architecture with a context-aware dynamic chunking mechanism. The proposed strategy adaptively adjusts chunk widths based on encoding states, enabling flexible receptive fields, cross-chunk information exchange, and robust adaptation to varying speaking rates, thereby alleviating the context truncation problem of fixed-chunk methods. To further capture the linguistic characteristics of Tibetan, we construct a lexicon grounded in its orthographic principles, providing linguistically motivated modeling units. During decoding, an external language model is integrated to enhance semantic consistency and improve recognition of long sentences. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves a word error rate (WER) of 6.23% on the test set, yielding a 48.15% relative improvement over the fixed-chunk baseline, while significantly reducing recognition latency and maintaining performance close to global decoding.

*Ritsu Sakabe,Hwichan Kim,Tosho Hirasawa,Mamoru Komachi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文通过引入日本即兴喜剧Oogiri，构建多维度数据集评估大语言模型（LLM）的幽默生成与评价能力，发现LLM在共情维度上显著不足，且其评价标准更重视新颖性而非人类所重视的共情。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对大语言模型幽默能力的评估多依赖单一维度（如‘是否好笑’），缺乏对幽默多面性的理解，难以全面反映模型在真实对话中的表现。

Method: 扩展了Oogiri数据集，加入新来源数据和LLM生成的回答，并对扩展后的数据集进行人工标注，涵盖新颖性、清晰度、相关性、智力、共情和整体好笑程度六个维度的5点评分；基于此评估LLM在生成和评价两个任务上的表现。

Result: LLM生成的Oogiri回答水平介于低到中等人类表现之间，但在共情维度上明显不足；LLM在评估回答时更看重新颖性，而人类更看重共情，导致两者评价标准存在根本差异。

Conclusion: 幽默理解需多维度视角，当前LLM因缺乏共情而在幽默生成与人类一致性评估上受限；释放标注语料库以推动更具情感智能的对话系统发展。

Abstract: Computational humor is a frontier for creating advanced and engaging natural language processing (NLP) applications, such as sophisticated dialogue systems. While previous studies have benchmarked the humor capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), they have often relied on single-dimensional evaluations, such as judging whether something is simply ``funny.'' This paper argues that a multifaceted understanding of humor is necessary and addresses this gap by systematically evaluating LLMs through the lens of Oogiri, a form of Japanese improvisational comedy games. To achieve this, we expanded upon existing Oogiri datasets with data from new sources and then augmented the collection with Oogiri responses generated by LLMs. We then manually annotated this expanded collection with 5-point absolute ratings across six dimensions: Novelty, Clarity, Relevance, Intelligence, Empathy, and Overall Funniness. Using this dataset, we assessed the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs on two core tasks: their ability to generate creative Oogiri responses and their ability to evaluate the funniness of responses using a six-dimensional evaluation. Our results show that while LLMs can generate responses at a level between low- and mid-tier human performance, they exhibit a notable lack of Empathy. This deficit in Empathy helps explain their failure to replicate human humor assessment. Correlation analyses of human and model evaluation data further reveal a fundamental divergence in evaluation criteria: LLMs prioritize Novelty, whereas humans prioritize Empathy. We release our annotated corpus to the community to pave the way for the development of more emotionally intelligent and sophisticated conversational agents.

Conclusion: 兴趣对齐的个性化阅读材料能有效提升外语学习者的阅读理解能力与学习动机，基于大模型的内容转创是实现个性化教学的有效途径。

Abstract: Personalized learning has gained attention in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) education, where engagement and motivation play crucial roles in reading comprehension. We propose a novel approach to generating personalized English reading comprehension tests tailored to students' interests. We develop a structured content transcreation pipeline using OpenAI's gpt-4o, where we start with the RACE-C dataset, and generate new passages and multiple-choice reading comprehension questions that are linguistically similar to the original passages but semantically aligned with individual learners' interests. Our methodology integrates topic extraction, question classification based on Bloom's taxonomy, linguistic feature analysis, and content transcreation to enhance student engagement. We conduct a controlled experiment with EFL learners in South Korea to examine the impact of interest-aligned reading materials on comprehension and motivation. Our results show students learning with personalized reading passages demonstrate improved comprehension and motivation retention compared to those learning with non-personalized materials.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Denoising Positional Encoding (DoPE)的无训练位置编码方法，通过截断矩阵熵检测特征图中的异常频带，并利用高斯分布重新参数化以实现长序列外推的鲁棒性。该方法揭示了注意力沉降现象的理论成因，并在长达64K token的任务中显著提升了检索准确性和推理稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) 在处理长序列外推时存在固有限制，导致注意力机制性能下降，本文旨在解决这一问题并提升模型在超长上下文中的泛化能力。

Method: 将带有位置编码的注意力图重新解释为含噪特征图，使用截断矩阵熵检测异常频率带，并基于噪声特性采用无参数高斯分布进行重新参数化，从而实现无需训练的位置编码优化。

Result: 在needle-in-a-haystack和多-shot上下文学习任务中，DoPE在长达64K token的上下文中显著提高了检索精度和推理稳定性，有效缓解了注意力沉降问题，恢复了均衡的注意力模式。

Conclusion: Denoising Positional Encoding (DoPE) 是一种简单而强大的位置编码改进方法，通过去噪策略实现了优异的长度外推性能，为大模型的长上下文建模提供了新的理论视角和实用解决方案。

Abstract: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) in Transformer models has inherent limits that weaken length extrapolation. We reinterpret the attention map with positional encoding as a noisy feature map, and propose Denoising Positional Encoding (DoPE), a training-free method based on truncated matrix entropy to detect outlier frequency bands in the feature map. Leveraging the noise characteristics of the feature map, we further reparameterize it with a parameter-free Gaussian distribution to achieve robust extrapolation. Our method theoretically reveals the underlying cause of the attention sink phenomenon and its connection to truncated matrix entropy. Experiments on needle-in-a-haystack and many-shot in-context learning tasks demonstrate that DoPE significantly improves retrieval accuracy and reasoning stability across extended contexts (up to 64K tokens). The results show that the denoising strategy for positional embeddings effectively mitigates attention sinks and restores balanced attention patterns, providing a simple yet powerful solution for improving length generalization.

TL;DR: 本文提出了LoopTool，一个全自动、模型感知的数据进化框架，通过闭环整合数据生成与模型训练来提升大语言模型的工具使用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的工具学习受限于静态的合成数据流水线，无法自适应地关注模型的弱点，并且容易保留噪声标签，导致训练效率低下。

Method: LoopTool包含三个协同模块：贪婪能力探测（GCP）诊断模型掌握和失败的能力；判断引导的标签验证（JGLV）利用开源评判模型发现并纠正标注错误；错误驱动的数据扩展（EDDE）基于识别出的失败生成新的挑战性样本。该过程在低成本的开源生态系统中运行。

Result: 实验表明，使用LoopTool训练的8B模型显著超越了其32B的数据生成器，并在BFCL-v3和ACEBench基准测试中达到了当前最优性能。

Conclusion: 闭环、自我优化的数据流水线能显著增强大语言模型的工具使用能力。

Abstract: Augmenting Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools enables them to execute complex, multi-step tasks. However, tool learning is hampered by the static synthetic data pipelines where data generation and model training are executed as two separate, non-interactive processes. This approach fails to adaptively focus on a model's specific weaknesses and allows noisy labels to persist, degrading training efficiency. We introduce LoopTool, a fully automated, model-aware data evolution framework that closes this loop by tightly integrating data synthesis and model training. LoopTool iteratively refines both the data and the model through three synergistic modules: (1) Greedy Capability Probing (GCP) diagnoses the model's mastered and failed capabilities; (2) Judgement-Guided Label Verification (JGLV) uses an open-source judge model to find and correct annotation errors, progressively purifying the dataset; and (3) Error-Driven Data Expansion (EDDE) generates new, challenging samples based on identified failures. This closed-loop process operates within a cost-effective, open-source ecosystem, eliminating dependence on expensive closed-source APIs. Experiments show that our 8B model trained with LoopTool significantly surpasses its 32B data generator and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the BFCL-v3 and ACEBench benchmarks for its scale. Our work demonstrates that closed-loop, self-refining data pipelines can dramatically enhance the tool-use capabilities of LLMs.

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining increased attention in the domain of Table Question Answering (TQA), particularly for extracting information from tables in documents. However, directly entering entire tables as long text into LLMs often leads to incorrect answers because most LLMs cannot inherently capture complex table structures. In this paper, we propose a cell extraction method for TQA without manual identification, even for complex table headers. Our approach estimates table headers by computing similarities between a given question and individual cells via a hybrid retrieval mechanism that integrates a language model and TF-IDF. We then select as the answer the cells at the intersection of the most relevant row and column. Furthermore, the language model is trained using contrastive learning on a small dataset of question-header pairs to enhance performance. We evaluated our approach in the TQA dataset from the U4 shared task at NTCIR-18. The experimental results show that our pipeline achieves an accuracy of 74.6\%, outperforming existing LLMs such as GPT-4o mini~(63.9\%). In the future, although we used traditional encoder models for retrieval in this study, we plan to incorporate more efficient text-search models to improve performance and narrow the gap with human evaluation results.

*Amal Sunny,Advay Gupta,Vishnu Sreekumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文验证了基于上下文的sequentiality度量在评估文章连贯性和组织性方面优于基于主题的版本，并能有效补充标准语言特征，提升自动评分性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始的sequentiality度量因主题选择方式存在混淆问题，且缺乏与真实流畅度的验证；因此需要一个更合理、可解释的替代方案。

Method: 使用ASAP++和ELLIPSE两个带有人工标注特征分数的作文数据集，比较基于上下文的sequentiality与其他变体（如仅主题或原始版本）在预测话语特征（如组织性与连贯性）上的表现，并结合零样本大模型进行对比。

Result: 基于上下文的sequentiality比原始方法更贴近人类评价，在与标准语言特征结合时提供更高的预测价值，且整体组合表现优于零样本大模型预测结果。

Conclusion: 支持使用基于上下文的sequentiality作为可解释、经实证有效的指标，可用于自动作文评分及相关NLP任务中。

Abstract: Recent work has proposed using Large Language Models (LLMs) to quantify narrative flow through a measure called sequentiality, which combines topic and contextual terms. A recent critique argued that the original results were confounded by how topics were selected for the topic-based component, and noted that the metric had not been validated against ground-truth measures of flow. That work proposed using only the contextual term as a more conceptually valid and interpretable alternative. In this paper, we empirically validate that proposal. Using two essay datasets with human-annotated trait scores, ASAP++ and ELLIPSE, we show that the contextual version of sequentiality aligns more closely with human assessments of discourse-level traits such as Organization and Cohesion. While zero-shot prompted LLMs predict trait scores more accurately than the contextual measure alone, the contextual measure adds more predictive value than both the topic-only and original sequentiality formulations when combined with standard linguistic features. Notably, this combination also outperforms the zero-shot LLM predictions, highlighting the value of explicitly modeling sentence-to-sentence flow. Our findings support the use of context-based sequentiality as a validated, interpretable, and complementary feature for automated essay scoring and related NLP tasks.

*Francois Meyer,Jan Buys*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了在预训练和微调过程中，语言模型如何动态优化子词切分，并分析了不同语言的子词学习动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索子词切分在训练过程中的动态演化，特别是在不同形态复杂度语言中的表现。

Method: 扩展了子词分段语言模型（SSLM）框架，支持预训练和微调，并在三种类型不同的语言（Isi-Xhosa、Setswana和英语）上进行实验。

Result: 识别出子词学习的四个阶段，形态复杂的Isi-Xhosa表现出更大的不稳定性；微调期间子词边界变得更细粒度。

Conclusion: 可学习的子词切分有助于提升低资源、形态复杂语言的文本生成和跨语言迁移性能。

Abstract: Subword segmentation is typically applied in preprocessing and stays fixed during training. Alternatively, it can be learned during training to optimise the training objective. In this paper we study the learning dynamics of subword segmentation: if a language model can dynamically optimise tokenisation, how do its subwords evolve during pretraining and finetuning? To explore this, we extend the subword segmental language model (SSLM), a framework for learning subwords during training, to support pretraining and finetuning. We train models for three typologically diverse languages to study learning dynamics across the morphological spectrum: Isi-Xhosa is conjunctive (long word forms composed of many morphemes), Setswana is disjunctive (morphemes written as separate words), and English represents a typological middle ground. We analyse subword dynamics from a linguistic perspective, tracking morphology, productivity, and fertility. We identify four stages of subword learning, with the morphologically complex isi-Xhosa exhibiting greater instability. During finetuning, subword boundaries shift to become finer-grained. Lastly, we show that learnable subwords offers a promising approach to improve text generation and cross-lingual transfer for low-resource, morphologically complex languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的语言模型对齐方法在面对负奖励主导的早期训练时容易崩溃，尤其在需要判断前提无法得出结论的‘诚实对齐’任务中表现不佳。因此需要更稳定的训练方法。

Method: 构建了两个包含不可回答案例的多步演绎推理数据集（线性代数与逻辑推理），提出Anchor方法，在强化学习的rollout过程中注入真实轨迹以稳定训练，并比较多种稳定策略（如课程学习）的效果。

Result: 实验表明GRPO在该任务上表现不佳；课程学习有一定帮助但依赖精心设计的数据分布；Anchor方法能有效防止训练崩溃，显著提升模型的推理性能和稳定性。

Conclusion: 训练动态对实现可靠演绎推理至关重要，Anchor方法通过引入真实轨迹增强了训练稳定性，为语言模型在复杂推理任务中的诚实对齐提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a promising framework for aligning language models with complex reasoning objectives. However, most existing methods optimize only for final task outcomes, leaving models vulnerable to collapse when negative rewards dominate early training. This challenge is especially pronounced in honesty alignment, where models must not only solve answerable queries but also identify when conclusions cannot be drawn from the given premises. Deductive reasoning provides an ideal testbed because it isolates reasoning capability from reliance on external factual knowledge. To investigate honesty alignment, we curate two multi-step deductive reasoning datasets from graph structures, one for linear algebra and one for logical inference, and introduce unanswerable cases by randomly perturbing an edge in half of the instances. We find that GRPO, with or without supervised fine tuning initialization, struggles on these tasks. Through extensive experiments across three models, we evaluate stabilization strategies and show that curriculum learning provides some benefit but requires carefully designed in distribution datasets with controllable difficulty. To address these limitations, we propose Anchor, a reinforcement learning method that injects ground truth trajectories into rollouts, preventing early training collapse. Our results demonstrate that this method stabilizes learning and significantly improves the overall reasoning performance, underscoring the importance of training dynamics for enabling reliable deductive reasoning in aligned language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音大模型在多语言语音到文本翻译中忽视源语言间的语义共性，导致翻译性能偏差。

Method: 引入偏置补偿模块进行跨语言语音表征粗对齐，结合Q-Former上的token级最优传输约束和层调度策略实现细粒度对齐。

Result: 在FLEURS数据集上，仅用每语言10小时平行语音，平均提升0.93 BLEU（五种常见语言）和5.05 BLEU（零样本语言）。

Conclusion: POTSA通过最优传输有效缩小了高低资源语言间的翻译差距，显著提升多语言S2TT的均衡性能。

Abstract: Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) have achieved breakthroughs in multilingual speech-to-text translation (S2TT). However, existing approaches often overlook semantic commonalities across source languages, leading to biased translation performance. In this work, we propose \textbf{POTSA} (Parallel Optimal Transport for Speech Alignment), a new framework based on cross-lingual parallel speech pairs and Optimal Transport (OT), designed to bridge high- and low-resource translation gaps. First, we introduce a Bias Compensation module to coarsely align initial speech representations across languages. Second, we impose token-level OT constraints on a Q-Former using parallel speech pairs to establish fine-grained consistency of representations. Then, we apply a layer scheduling strategy to focus OT constraints on the most semantically beneficial layers. Experiments on the FLEURS dataset show that our method achieves SOTA performance, with +0.93 BLEU on average over five common languages and +5.05 BLEU on zero-shot languages, using only 10 hours of parallel speech per source language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多属性控制方面存在局限，难以处理属性间的冲突，且缺乏迭代优化机制，无法实现精确的多维属性调控。

Method: C$^3$TG框架在生成阶段选择性地结合LLM与属性分类器，并使用加权KL散度调整token概率；在优化阶段通过融合分类器得分和惩罚项的能量函数，利用迭代反馈解决属性冲突。

Result: 实验表明，C$^3$TG在属性准确性、语言流畅性、输出多样性等指标上显著优于基线方法，同时降低了文本毒性。

Conclusion: C$^3$TG是一种高效且灵活的多维文本属性控制方法，无需昂贵的模型修改即可实现精准、协调的可控文本生成。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable text generation capabilities. However, controlling specific attributes of generated text remains challenging without architectural modifications or extensive fine-tuning. Current methods typically toggle a single, basic attribute but struggle with precise multi-attribute control. In scenarios where attribute requirements conflict, existing methods lack coordination mechanisms, causing interference between desired attributes. Furthermore, these methods fail to incorporate iterative optimization processes in the controlled generation pipeline. To address these limitations, we propose Conflict-aware, Composite, and Collaborative Controlled Text Generation (C$^3$TG), a two-phase framework for fine-grained, multi-dimensional text attribute control. During generation, C$^3$TG selectively pairs the LLM with the required attribute classifiers from the 17 available dimensions and employs weighted KL-divergence to adjust token probabilities. The optimization phase then leverages an energy function combining classifier scores and penalty terms to resolve attribute conflicts through iterative feedback, enabling precise control over multiple dimensions simultaneously while preserving natural text flow. Experiments show that C$^3$TG significantly outperforms baselines across multiple metrics including attribute accuracy, linguistic fluency, and output diversity, while simultaneously reducing toxicity. These results establish C$^3$TG as an effective and flexible solution for multi-dimensional text attribute control that requires no costly model modifications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了推动创意写作大语言模型的个性化发展，解决现有数据集中个人品味被当作单一整体的问题。

Method: 构建了一个包含60人阅读习惯和偏好的数据集，包括自我报告的陈述偏好和对100对短篇创意文本标注的揭示偏好，并使用Transformer编码器进行偏好建模。

Result: 人们在创意写作偏好上存在显著差异；微调后的Transformer编码器在个体和群体揭示偏好建模上分别达到75.8%和67.7%的准确率；陈述偏好对揭示偏好的预测能力较弱。

Conclusion: 该研究为个性化创意写作技术的发展提供了基础数据支持和实证依据。

Abstract: People have different creative writing preferences, and large language models (LLMs) for these tasks can benefit from adapting to each user's preferences. However, these models are often trained over a dataset that considers varying personal tastes as a monolith. To facilitate developing personalized creative writing LLMs, we introduce LiteraryTaste, a dataset of reading preferences from 60 people, where each person: 1) self-reported their reading habits and tastes (stated preference), and 2) annotated their preferences over 100 pairs of short creative writing texts (revealed preference). With our dataset, we found that: 1) people diverge on creative writing preferences, 2) finetuning a transformer encoder could achieve 75.8% and 67.7% accuracy when modeling personal and collective revealed preferences, and 3) stated preferences had limited utility in modeling revealed preferences. With an LLM-driven interpretability pipeline, we analyzed how people's preferences vary. We hope our work serves as a cornerstone for personalizing creative writing technologies.

Conclusion: 该方法提升了高棉语情感分类的可解释性与实用性，为低资源语言的NLP研究提供了有价值的资源和范例。

Abstract: Khmer polarity classification is a fundamental natural language processing task that assigns a positive, negative, or neutral label to a given Khmer text input. Existing Khmer models typically predict the label without explaining the rationale behind the prediction. This paper proposes an explainable Khmer polarity classifier by fine-tuning an instruction-based reasoning Qwen-3 model. The notion of explainability in this paper is limited to self-explanations, which the model uses to rationalize its predictions. Experimental results show that the fine-tuned model not only predicts labels accurately but also provides reasoning by identifying polarity-related keywords or phrases to support its predictions. In addition, we contribute a new Khmer polarity dataset consisting of short- to medium-length casual, romanized, and mixed-code Khmer expressions. This dataset was constructed using both heuristic rules and human curation and is publicly available through a gated Hugging Face repository (rinabuoy/khmerpolarity_nonreasoning). The fine-tuned Qwen-3 models are also made available in the same Hugging Face account.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用固定删除率，难以应对自然语言等变长输入，导致认证性能不佳。

Method: 提出AdaptDel方法，扩展随机平滑理论至可变删除率场景，实现基于输入特性的动态调整。

Result: 在自然语言任务中取得显著效果，相比当前最优方法，认证区域的中位基数提升高达30个数量级。

Conclusion: AdaptDel能有效提升序列分类模型在编辑距离扰动下的鲁棒性认证能力，尤其适用于变长输入场景。

Abstract: We consider the problem of certified robustness for sequence classification against edit distance perturbations. Naturally occurring inputs of varying lengths (e.g., sentences in natural language processing tasks) present a challenge to current methods that employ fixed-rate deletion mechanisms and lead to suboptimal performance. To this end, we introduce AdaptDel methods with adaptable deletion rates that dynamically adjust based on input properties. We extend the theoretical framework of randomized smoothing to variable-rate deletion, ensuring sound certification with respect to edit distance. We achieve strong empirical results in natural language tasks, observing up to 30 orders of magnitude improvement to median cardinality of the certified region, over state-of-the-art certifications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为mmJEE-Eval的多模态双语基准测试，用于评估视觉-语言模型在科学推理方面的能力，特别是在物理、化学和数学领域的复杂问题解决能力。该基准基于印度JEE高级考试题目，涵盖了2019-2025年的1460道题。研究发现，尽管前沿模型在现有基准上表现良好，但在mmJEE-Eval上表现出显著差异，尤其是当推理负担增加时，这些模型的表现大幅下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态推理基准无法充分区分模型的真实科学推理能力和简单的模式匹配能力，因此需要一个新的更具挑战性的基准来更准确地评估模型的推理能力。

Method: 构建了一个包含1460道来自印度JEE高级考试（2019-2025年）的多模态双语（英语和印地语）基准测试mmJEE-Eval，涵盖物理、化学和数学领域。对17种最先进的模型进行了评估，并通过系统性消融实验分析了mmJEE-Eval的难度来源。

Result: 前沿闭源模型（如GPT-5、Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash）在保留的2025年问题上达到了77-84%的准确率，而开源模型即使扩展到4000亿参数也仅达到37-45%。然而，在增加元认知推理负担时，这些闭源模型的表现急剧下降（例如GPT-5仅修正5.2%的错误）。消融实验证明mmJEE-Eval的难度主要来自于问题的复杂性和推理深度，而非记忆化。

Conclusion: mmJEE-Eval能够有效区分不同训练和推理方法的优劣，揭示了当前模型在处理高推理负荷任务时的局限性，为未来的研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Contemporary vision-language models (VLMs) perform well on existing multimodal reasoning benchmarks (78-85\% accuracy on MMMU, MathVista). Yet, these results fail to sufficiently distinguish true scientific reasoning articulation capabilities from pattern-matching. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{mmJEE-Eval}, a multimodal bilingual (English and Hindi) benchmark comprising 1,460 questions from India's JEE Advanced examination (2019-2025) spanning pre-college Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics domains. Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art models reveals that while frontier VLMs (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash) achieve 77-84\% accuracy on held-out 2025 questions, open-source models plateau at 37-45\% despite scaling to 400B parameters, a significant difference not observed on existing benchmarks. While closed frontiers from Google and OpenAI show high problem-solving accuracies (up to 100\% pass@3 scores), they fully collapse when the reasoning load is increased meta-cognitively (GPT-5 fixes just 5.2\% errors). Systematic ablations show mmJEE-Eval's difficulty stems from complexity and reasoning depth rather than memorization. Effectively, our benchmark segregates superior training and reasoning methodologies where alternatives fail. We publicly release our code and data: https://mmjee-eval.github.io

Motivation: 现有测试时扩展方法在减少令牌消耗方面已有进展，但受限于顺序请求带来的高延迟，需要更高效的方法。

Method: 利用快速的系统1计算查询的答案熵，评估样本的扩展潜力，并据此在系统2中实现动态自一致性，支持并行生成以降低延迟和令牌使用。

Result: 相比现有方法，SeerSC最多减少47%的令牌消耗和43%的推理延迟，且无明显性能损失。

Conclusion: SeerSC通过融合双系统推理，有效提升了大语言模型测试时扩展的效率和可扩展性，兼顾性能、成本与延迟。

Abstract: Test-time scaling improves the inference performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) but also incurs substantial computational costs. Although recent studies have reduced token consumption through dynamic self-consistency, they remain constrained by the high latency of sequential requests. In this paper, we propose SeerSC, a dynamic self-consistency framework that simultaneously improves token efficiency and latency by integrating System 1 and System 2 reasoning. Specifically, we utilize the rapid System 1 to compute the answer entropy for given queries. This score is then used to evaluate the potential of samples for scaling, enabling dynamic self-consistency under System 2. Benefiting from the advance and accurate estimation provided by System 1, the proposed method can reduce token usage while simultaneously achieving a significant decrease in latency through parallel generation. It outperforms existing methods, achieving up to a 47% reduction in token consumption and a 43% reduction in inference latency without significant performance loss.

Conclusion: S2CLite是一种高效、准确且轻量的SPARQL到Cypher转换工具，其生成的Spider4SSC数据集为多语言文本到查询任务提供了有价值的资源，且工具与数据集均已开源。

Abstract: We present Spider4SSC dataset and S2CLite parsing tool. S2CLite is a lightweight, ontology-agnostic parser that translates SPARQL queries into Cypher queries, enabling both in-situ and large-scale SPARQL to Cypher translation. Unlike existing solutions, S2CLite is purely rule-based (inspired by traditional programming language compilers) and operates without requiring an RDF graph or external tools. Experiments conducted on the BSBM42 and Spider4SPARQL datasets show that S2CLite significantly reduces query parsing errors, achieving a total parsing accuracy of 77.8% on Spider4SPARQL compared to 44.2% by the state-of-the-art S2CTrans. Furthermore, S2CLite achieved a 96.6\% execution accuracy on the intersecting subset of queries parsed by both parsers, outperforming S2CTrans by 7.3%. We further use S2CLite to parse Spider4SPARQL queries to Cypher and generate Spider4SSC, a unified Text-to-Query language (SQL, SPARQL, Cypher) dataset with 4525 unique questions and 3 equivalent sets of 2581 matching queries (SQL, SPARQL and Cypher). We open-source S2CLite for further development on GitHub (github.com/vejvarm/S2CLite) and provide the clean Spider4SSC dataset for download.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型在任务特定评估中表现良好，但在多语言环境下对文本质量进行通用评估的能力尚不明确，因此需要一个更普适、可扩展的评估框架。

Method: 构建MTQ-Eval框架，首先自动生成文本质量偏好数据，然后利用这些数据微调开源基础大语言模型，使其能够区分高低质量文本并调整内部表示。

Result: 在115种语言上的实验表明，MTQ-Eval显著提升了文本质量评估性能，并且该能力还带来了下游任务的性能改进。

Conclusion: MTQ-Eval有效增强了大语言模型在多语言文本质量评估方面的能力，具有良好的泛化性和应用潜力。

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) for evaluating outputs is becoming an increasingly effective and scalable approach. However, it remains uncertain whether this capability extends beyond task-specific evaluations to more general assessments of text quality, particularly in multilingual contexts. In this study, we introduce, MTQ-Eval, a novel framework for multilingual text quality evaluation that learns from examples of both high- and low-quality texts, adjusting its internal representations. To develop MTQ-Eval, we first automatically generate text quality preference data and then use it to train open-source base LLMs to align with ratings of high- and low-quality text. Our comprehensive evaluation across 115 languages demonstrates the improved performance of the proposed model. Upon further analysis, we find that this enhanced evaluation capability also leads to notable improvements in downstream tasks.

Method: 通过在多种自然语言理解与推理任务上评估不同规模和家族的语言模型，分析其在两种范式下的性能趋势与错误修正行为。

Result: 发现开放式生成利于重新解释和组合式优化，而多选题选择虽边界清晰但受限于选项本身；两类任务表现出不同的改进模式与失败机制。

Conclusion: 自我修正机制的设计应考虑任务结构与输出空间的相互作用，这对基于知识的推理和决策导向的LLM应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated remarkable abilities to self-correct their responses through iterative refinement, often referred to as self-consistency or self-reflection. However, the dynamics of this self-correction mechanism may differ substantially depending on whether the model is tasked with open-ended text generation or with selecting the most appropriate response from multiple predefined options. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation of these two paradigms by comparing performance trends and error-correction behaviors across various natural language understanding and reasoning tasks, covering language models of different scales and families. Our experimental results reveal distinct patterns of improvement and failure modes:
  \textit{While open-ended generation often benefits from the flexibility of re-interpretation and compositional refinement, multiple-choice selection can leverage clearer solution boundaries but may be limited by the provided options}. This contrast also reflects the dual demands faced by emerging agentic LLM applications: effective agents must not only generate and refine open-ended plans or explanations, but also make reliable discrete choices when operating within constrained action spaces. Our findings, therefore, highlight that the design of self-correction mechanisms should take into account the interaction between task structure and output space, with implications for both knowledge-intensive reasoning and decision-oriented applications of LLMs.

### [119] [AMaPO: Adaptive Margin-attached Preference Optimization for Language Model Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09385)
*Ruibo Deng,Duanyu Feng,Wenqiang Lei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的离线偏好优化算法AMaPO，通过实例自适应边距解决现有方法中的过拟合与欠拟合困境，显著提升排序准确性和模型对齐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的离线偏好优化方法受限于排序准确性，其根本原因在于固定边距设计导致正确排序样本过拟合、错误排序样本欠拟合，形成过拟合-欠拟合困境。

Method: 提出AMaPO算法，采用实例级自适应边距，并结合Z-normalization和指数缩放进行优化，动态调整学习梯度：增强对错序样本的纠正信号，抑制对正确排序样本的冗余梯度。

Result: 在多个主流基准上实验表明，AMaPO在排序准确率和下游对齐任务性能上均优于现有方法，且分析验证了其有效缓解了过拟合与欠拟合问题。

Conclusion: AMaPO通过自适应边距机制有效解决了偏好优化中的梯度分配失衡问题，为离线偏好学习提供了更高效、稳定的优化方案。

Abstract: Offline preference optimization offers a simpler and more stable alternative to RLHF for aligning language models. However, their effectiveness is critically dependent on ranking accuracy, a metric where further gains are highly impactful. This limitation arises from a fundamental problem that we identify and formalize as the Overfitting-Underfitting Dilemma: current margin designs cause models to apply excessive, wasteful gradients to correctly ranked samples (overfitting) while providing insufficient corrective signals for misranked ones (underfitting). To resolve this dilemma, we propose Adaptive Margin-attached Preference Optimization (AMaPO), a simple yet principled algorithm. AMaPO employs an instance-wise adaptive margin, refined by Z-normalization and exponential scaling, which dynamically reallocates learning effort by amplifying gradients for misranked samples and suppressing them for correct ones. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks demonstrate that AMaPO not only achieves better ranking accuracy and superior downstream alignment performance, but targeted analysis also confirms that it successfully mitigates the core overfitting and underfitting issues.

*Lukas Arana,Julen Etxaniz,Ander Salaberria,Gorka Azkune*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文旨在为低资源语言（如巴斯克语）开发强大的多模态大语言模型（MLLM），通过构建专用数据集和探索不同数据组合，发现仅需约20%的巴斯克语多模态数据即可取得良好性能，且无需使用巴斯克语指令微调的LLM作为骨干模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前开源社区在低资源语言的多模态大语言模型方面表现不足，而商业MLLM虽有一定效果，但缺乏公开资源支持。因此，研究如何在低资源语言上构建高性能的开源MLLM具有重要意义。

Method: 构建了针对巴斯克语的图像-文本训练与评估数据集，采用Llama-3.1-Instruct和巴斯克语适配版本Latxa两种大模型作为骨干网络，尝试多种数据混合方案进行训练，并评估不同设置下的模型表现。

Result: 实验表明：1）仅使用约20%的巴斯克语多模态数据即可在巴斯克语基准上获得良好性能；2）无需使用巴斯克语指令微调的骨干LLM即可构建高性能的巴斯克语MLLM。

Conclusion: 该研究为低资源语言的MLLM开发提供了可行路径，并通过公开资源促进开放科学发展。

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models exhibit very strong performance for several demanding tasks. While commercial MLLMs deliver acceptable performance in low-resource languages, comparable results remain unattained within the open science community. In this paper, we aim to develop a strong MLLM for a low-resource language, namely Basque. For that purpose, we develop our own training and evaluation image-text datasets. Using two different Large Language Models as backbones, the Llama-3.1-Instruct model and a Basque-adapted variant called Latxa, we explore several data mixtures for training. We show that: i) low ratios of Basque multimodal data (around 20%) are already enough to obtain solid results on Basque benchmarks, and ii) contrary to expected, a Basque instructed backbone LLM is not required to obtain a strong MLLM in Basque. Our results pave the way to develop MLLMs for other low-resource languages by openly releasing our resources.

Abstract: The mismatch between the growing demand for psychological counseling and the limited availability of services has motivated research into the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in this domain. Consequently, there is a need for a robust and unified benchmark to assess the counseling competence of various LLMs. Existing works, however, are limited by unprofessional client simulation, static question-and-answer evaluation formats, and unidimensional metrics. These limitations hinder their effectiveness in assessing a model's comprehensive ability to handle diverse and complex clients. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{CARE-Bench}, a dynamic and interactive automated benchmark. It is built upon diverse client profiles derived from real-world counseling cases and simulated according to expert guidelines. CARE-Bench provides a multidimensional performance evaluation grounded in established psychological scales. Using CARE-Bench, we evaluate several general-purpose LLMs and specialized counseling models, revealing their current limitations. In collaboration with psychologists, we conduct a detailed analysis of the reasons for LLMs' failures when interacting with clients of different types, which provides directions for developing more comprehensive, universal, and effective counseling models.

Motivation: 为了提升机器学习研究的理解性和可复现性，需要从科学出版物中大规模提取细粒度信息，如方法训练和数据使用情况，现有方法和数据集难以满足这一需求。

Method: 构建了一个手动标注的精细数据集GSAP-ERE，包含63K个实体提及和35K个关系，涵盖10类实体和18类语义关系，并基于该数据集训练了信息抽取的微调模型，同时将其作为测试集评估大语言模型在信息抽取任务上的提示策略性能。

Conclusion: GSAP-ERE数据集为机器学习领域的细粒度信息抽取提供了重要资源，当前大语言模型在无监督提示下的表现远不如监督微调模型，强调了构建高质量标注数据集以推动学术信息抽取研究的必要性。

Abstract: Research in Machine Learning (ML) and AI evolves rapidly. Information Extraction (IE) from scientific publications enables to identify information about research concepts and resources on a large scale and therefore is a pathway to improve understanding and reproducibility of ML-related research. To extract and connect fine-grained information in ML-related research, e.g. method training and data usage, we introduce GSAP-ERE. It is a manually curated fine-grained dataset with 10 entity types and 18 semantically categorized relation types, containing mentions of 63K entities and 35K relations from the full text of 100 ML publications. We show that our dataset enables fine-tuned models to automatically extract information relevant for downstream tasks ranging from knowledge graph (KG) construction, to monitoring the computational reproducibility of AI research at scale. Additionally, we use our dataset as a test suite to explore prompting strategies for IE using Large Language Models (LLM). We observe that the performance of state-of-the-art LLM prompting methods is largely outperformed by our best fine-tuned baseline model (NER: 80.6%, RE: 54.0% for the fine-tuned model vs. NER: 44.4%, RE: 10.1% for the LLM). This disparity of performance between supervised models and unsupervised usage of LLMs suggests datasets like GSAP-ERE are needed to advance research in the domain of scholarly information extraction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从大量生成文本中预测个体人格具有挑战性，且大语言模型存在输入长度限制。

Method: 提出目标预选文本（TPoT）方法，对文本进行语义过滤，仅保留与特定人格特质、层面或项目相关的内容，并输入到深度学习模型（BIG5-TPoT）中进行预测。

Result: 在Stream of Consciousness Essays数据集上，该方法有效降低了预测的平均绝对误差，提高了准确性。

Conclusion: TPoT方法不仅能缓解大语言模型的输入长度限制问题，还能显著提升人格预测性能。

Abstract: Predicting an individual's personalities from their generated texts is a challenging task, especially when the text volume is large. In this paper, we introduce a straightforward yet effective novel strategy called targeted preselection of texts (TPoT). This method semantically filters the texts as input to a deep learning model, specifically designed to predict a Big Five personality trait, facet, or item, referred to as the BIG5-TPoT model. By selecting texts that are semantically relevant to a particular trait, facet, or item, this strategy not only addresses the issue of input text limits in large language models but also improves the Mean Absolute Error and accuracy metrics in predictions for the Stream of Consciousness Essays dataset.

### [124] [Readability Measures and Automatic Text Simplification: In the Search of a Construct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09536)
*Rémi Cardon,A. Seza Doğruöz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了可读性度量在自动文本简化（ATS）中的作用，研究发现可读性度量与自动评估指标及人工判断之间的相关性普遍较低，表明需要对ATS中的评估构念进行明确定义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的研究多关注自动评估指标与人工判断的相关性，但缺乏对可读性度量与这些评估方式之间关系的深入分析，因此本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过分析可读性度量与人工判断、以及可读性度量与ATS自动评估指标之间的相关性，并结合英语语料进行实证研究。

Result: 研究发现，总体上可读性度量与自动评估指标和人工判断的相关性较弱。

Conclusion: 由于文本简化的三种评估角度（可读性度量、自动指标、人工判断）之间相关性较低，因此有必要在ATS中建立更清晰的评估构念定义。

Abstract: Readability is a key concept in the current era of abundant written information. To help making texts more readable and make information more accessible to everyone, a line of researched aims at making texts accessible for their target audience: automatic text simplification (ATS). Lately, there have been studies on the correlations between automatic evaluation metrics in ATS and human judgment. However, the correlations between those two aspects and commonly available readability measures (such as readability formulas or linguistic features) have not been the focus of as much attention. In this work, we investigate the place of readability measures in ATS by complementing the existing studies on evaluation metrics and human judgment, on English. We first discuss the relationship between ATS and research in readability, then we report a study on correlations between readability measures and human judgment, and between readability measures and ATS evaluation metrics. We identify that in general, readability measures do not correlate well with automatic metrics and human judgment. We argue that as the three different angles from which simplification can be assessed tend to exhibit rather low correlations with one another, there is a need for a clear definition of the construct in ATS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于构建标注资源成本高昂，需要一种可扩展的方法来训练和评估大语言模型在长上下文下的推理能力，特别是用于事实核查和幻觉检测的声明验证任务。

Method: 提出SynClaimEval框架，从输入特征、合成逻辑和解释质量三个维度评估合成数据的有效性，并在多个基准上进行实验。

Result: 实验证明，长上下文合成数据能提升基础指令微调模型的验证性能，尤其在补充人工数据时效果显著；同时还能提升模型解释的质量，即使验证准确率未提高。

Conclusion: 合成数据是一种有效的手段，不仅能增强长上下文下的声明验证能力，还能提高模型预测的可解释性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with extended context windows promise direct reasoning over long documents, reducing the need for chunking or retrieval. Constructing annotated resources for training and evaluation, however, remains costly. Synthetic data offers a scalable alternative, and we introduce SynClaimEval, a framework for evaluating synthetic data utility in long-context claim verification -- a task central to hallucination detection and fact-checking. Our framework examines three dimensions: (i) input characteristics, by varying context length and testing generalization to out-of-domain benchmarks; (ii) synthesis logic, by controlling claim complexity and error type variation; and (iii) explanation quality, measuring the degree to which model explanations provide evidence consistent with predictions. Experiments across benchmarks show that long-context synthesis can improve verification in base instruction-tuned models, particularly when augmenting existing human-written datasets. Moreover, synthesis enhances explanation quality, even when verification scores do not improve, underscoring its potential to strengthen both performance and explainability.

Motivation: 研究多语言模型代理在目标不一致情况下的交互动态，理解提示设计与系统稳定性、偏差及鲁棒性之间的关系。

Method: 建立了一个理论框架，分析两个基于语言模型的代理在上下文内进行迭代梯度更新时的生成动态，推导出目标差距和提示几何对残差误差的影响，并提出一种可实现单边成功的对抗算法。

Conclusion: 该框架将提示设计与多智能体交互的稳定性、偏差和鲁棒性联系起来，为研究、预测和防御多智能体系统行为提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework for agent-to-agent interactions in multi-agent scenarios. We consider the setup in which two language model based agents perform iterative gradient updates toward their respective objectives in-context, using the output of the other agent as input. We characterize the generation dynamics associated with the interaction when the agents have misaligned objectives, and show that this results in a biased equilibrium where neither agent reaches its target - with the residual errors predictable from the objective gap and the geometry induced by the prompt of each agent. We establish the conditions for asymmetric convergence and provide an algorithm that provably achieves an adversarial result, producing one-sided success. Experiments with trained transformer models as well as GPT$5$ for the task of in-context linear regression validate the theory. Our framework presents a setup to study, predict, and defend multi-agent systems; explicitly linking prompt design and interaction setup to stability, bias, and robustness.

Result: 理论证明了在去中心化执行下达到贝叶斯纳什均衡需访问全局效用函数；实验表明AA-MAMORL在MAMO Particle环境和MOMALand基准上均优于现有最先进方法。

Abstract: Multi-agent multi-objective systems (MAMOS) have emerged as powerful frameworks for modelling complex decision-making problems across various real-world domains, such as robotic exploration, autonomous traffic management, and sensor network optimisation. MAMOS offers enhanced scalability and robustness through decentralised control and more accurately reflects inherent trade-offs between conflicting objectives. In MAMOS, each agent uses utility functions that map return vectors to scalar values. Existing MAMOS optimisation methods face challenges in handling heterogeneous objective and utility function settings, where training non-stationarity is intensified due to private utility functions and the associated policies. In this paper, we first theoretically prove that direct access to, or structured modeling of, global utility functions is necessary for the Bayesian Nash Equilibrium under decentralised execution constraints. To access the global utility functions while preserving the decentralised execution, we propose an Agent-Attention Multi-Agent Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (AA-MAMORL) framework. Our approach implicitly learns a joint belief over other agents' utility functions and their associated policies during centralised training, effectively mapping global states and utilities to each agent's policy. In execution, each agent independently selects actions based on local observations and its private utility function to approximate a BNE, without relying on inter-agent communication. We conduct comprehensive experiments in both a custom-designed MAMO Particle environment and the standard MOMALand benchmark. The results demonstrate that access to global preferences and our proposed AA-MAMORL significantly improve performance and consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对多智能体系统中通信协议（包括拓扑和消息）的有效定义与优化，导致信息交换冗余低效。

Method: 提出了一个通用框架，设计了三个通信效率指标：IEI和SEI用于优化信息熵和角色专业化，作为损失函数调整；TEI用于显式评估通信量与任务性能之间的权衡。

Result: 实验表明，所提出的通信协议显著提高了通信效率，在减少冗余通信的同时提升了合作性能和任务成功率。

Conclusion: 该框架通过量化和优化通信效率，有效平衡了通信开销与任务性能，为多智能体通信提供了可衡量、可优化的新范式。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for modeling complex interactions among autonomous entities in distributed environments. In Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), communication enables coordination but can lead to inefficient information exchange, since agents may generate redundant or non-essential messages. While prior work has focused on boosting task performance with information exchange, the existing research lacks a thorough investigation of both the appropriate definition and the optimization of communication protocols (communication topology and message). To fill this gap, we introduce a generalized framework for learning multi-round communication protocols that are both effective and efficient. Within this framework, we propose three novel Communication Efficiency Metrics (CEMs) to guide and evaluate the learning process: the Information Entropy Efficiency Index (IEI) and Specialization Efficiency Index (SEI) for efficiency-augmented optimization, and the Topology Efficiency Index (TEI) for explicit evaluation. We integrate IEI and SEI as the adjusted loss functions to promote informative messaging and role specialization, while using TEI to quantify the trade-off between communication volume and task performance. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our learned communication protocol can significantly enhance communication efficiency and achieves better cooperation performance with improved success rates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始PIBT因仅考虑下一时刻的状态而具有速度快的优点，但在需要处理朝向和耗时旋转动作的场景下表现不佳，因此需要改进以提升其适用性和性能。

Method: 通过引入多动作操作对PIBT进行增强，并结合图引导技术和大邻域搜索优化策略，使其能够在不牺牲效率的前提下更好地处理复杂动作规划问题。

Result: 所提方法在在线LMAPF-T设置下表现出色，结合图引导和大邻域搜索后达到了当前最优的性能水平。

Conclusion: 增强版PIBT在保留原有高效特性的基础上，显著提升了在包含朝向和旋转动作场景中的路径规划能力，是解决此类问题的有效方案。

Abstract: PIBT is a rule-based Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) solver, widely used as a low-level planner or action sampler in many state-of-the-art approaches. Its primary advantage lies in its exceptional speed, enabling action selection for thousands of agents within milliseconds by considering only the immediate next timestep. However, this short-horizon design leads to poor performance in scenarios where agents have orientation and must perform time-consuming rotation actions. In this work, we present an enhanced version of PIBT that addresses this limitation by incorporating multi-action operations. We detail the modifications introduced to improve PIBT's performance while preserving its hallmark efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrate how our method, when combined with graph-guidance technique and large neighborhood search optimization, achieves state-of-the-art performance in the online LMAPF-T setting.

Conclusion: 所提方法使MAC算法更具可扩展性、可靠性，更适合实时估计应用。

Abstract: Long-term state estimation over graphs remains challenging as current graph estimation methods scale poorly on large, long-term graphs. To address this, our work advances a current state-of-the-art graph sparsification algorithm, maximizing algebraic connectivity (MAC). MAC is a sparsification method that preserves estimation performance by maximizing the algebraic connectivity, a spectral graph property that is directly connected to the estimation error. Unfortunately, MAC remains computationally prohibitive for online use and requires users to manually pre-specify a connectivity-preserving edge set. Our contributions close these gaps along three complementary fronts: we develop a specialized solver for algebraic connectivity that yields an average 2x runtime speedup; we investigate advanced step size strategies for MAC's optimization procedure to enhance both convergence speed and solution quality; and we propose automatic schemes that guarantee graph connectivity without requiring manual specification of edges. Together, these contributions make MAC more scalable, reliable, and suitable for real-time estimation applications.

Motivation: 现有的大规模视觉模型虽能提供物体的语义信息和大致位置，但缺乏精确控制灵巧手进行3D抓取所需的几何理解能力。

Method: 利用仿真环境中的力闭合抓取生成管道获取具有局部几何信息的抓取数据，并将这些数据蒸馏到一个能够在相机点云上实时运行的扩散模型中。

Result: 所提出的方法在无需任何手动收集训练数据的情况下，实现了高精度的语义抓取性能。

Conclusion: 结合全局语义理解和局部几何感知的方法能够有效提升机器人在复杂场景下的抓取能力，且无需依赖人工标注数据。

Abstract: Large Vision Models trained on internet-scale data have demonstrated strong capabilities in segmenting and semantically understanding object parts, even in cluttered, crowded scenes. However, while these models can direct a robot toward the general region of an object, they lack the geometric understanding required to precisely control dexterous robotic hands for 3D grasping. To overcome this, our key insight is to leverage simulation with a force-closure grasping generation pipeline that understands local geometries of the hand and object in the scene. Because this pipeline is slow and requires ground-truth observations, the resulting data is distilled into a diffusion model that operates in real-time on camera point clouds. By combining the global semantic understanding of internet-scale models with the geometric precision of a simulation-based locally-aware force-closure, \our achieves high-performance semantic grasping without any manually collected training data.

Abstract: Remarkable capabilities have been achieved by robotics and AI, mastering complex tasks and environments. Yet, humans often remain passive observers, fascinated but uncertain how to engage. Robots, in turn, cannot reach their full potential in human-populated environments without effectively modeling human states and intentions and adapting their behavior. To achieve a synergistic human-robot collaboration (HRC), a continuous information flow should be established: humans must intuitively communicate instructions, share expertise, and express needs. In parallel, robots must clearly convey their internal state and forthcoming actions to keep users informed, comfortable, and in control. This review identifies and connects key components enabling intuitive information exchange and skill transfer between humans and robots. We examine the full interaction pipeline: from the human-to-robot communication bridge translating multimodal inputs into robot-understandable representations, through adaptive planning and role allocation, to the control layer and feedback mechanisms to close the loop. Finally, we highlight trends and promising directions toward more adaptive, accessible HRC.

*Kai S. Yun,Navid Azizan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ATOM-CBF的安全控制框架，能够自适应感知模块在面对分布外测量时的认知不确定性，从而保障现实系统安全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有依赖学习感知模块的系统在遇到训练中未见的分布外测量时容易因认知不确定性而失效，缺乏无需真实标签或分布偏移信息即可保证安全的方法。

Method: 设计了两个关键组件：(1) 面向分布外感知的自适应误差边界；(2) 结合该误差边界的实时安全过滤器，动态调整保守性。

Result: 在F1Tenth车辆（LiDAR）和四足机器人（RGB图像）的仿真中验证了ATOM-CBF能有效维持系统安全性。

Conclusion: ATOM-CBF能够在无真实标签的情况下，通过自适应处理认知不确定性，提升高维传感器输入下系统的鲁棒安全性。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of real-world systems is challenging, especially when they rely on learned perception modules to infer the system state from high-dimensional sensor data. These perception modules are vulnerable to epistemic uncertainty, often failing when encountering out-of-distribution (OoD) measurements not seen during training. To address this gap, we introduce ATOM-CBF (Adaptive-To-OoD-Measurement Control Barrier Function), a novel safe control framework that explicitly computes and adapts to the epistemic uncertainty from OoD measurements, without the need for ground-truth labels or information on distribution shifts. Our approach features two key components: (1) an OoD-aware adaptive perception error margin and (2) a safety filter that integrates this adaptive error margin, enabling the filter to adjust its conservatism in real-time. We provide empirical validation in simulations, demonstrating that ATOM-CBF maintains safety for an F1Tenth vehicle with LiDAR scans and a quadruped robot with RGB images.

### [135] [CENIC: Convex Error-controlled Numerical Integration for Contact](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08771)
*Vince Kurtz,Alejandro Castro*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的连续时间积分器CENIC，结合了凸时间步进和误差控制积分的最新进展，能够在保证精度和收敛性的同时实现与现有离散时间机器人模拟器相当的实时仿真速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的离散时间机器人模拟器需要手动选择时间步长，过大可能导致非物理现象，过小则降低效率；而现有误差控制积分器在处理接触刚体动力学时表现不佳，难以满足现代机器人工作流的速度和可扩展性需求。

Method: CENIC融合了凸时间步进和误差控制积分的优点，采用连续时间误差控制机制自动调整时间步长，并针对接触刚性动态进行了优化设计。

Result: CENIC在保持高精度和收敛性保证的同时，达到了与MuJoCo、Drake和Isaac Sim等主流离散时间模拟器相媲美的实时仿真速度。

Conclusion: CENIC为机器人仿真提供了一种兼具高精度、高效率和良好收敛性的连续时间解决方案，有望成为新一代高性能模拟器的基础。

Abstract: State-of-the-art robotics simulators operate in discrete time. This requires users to choose a time step, which is both critical and challenging: large steps can produce non-physical artifacts, while small steps force the simulation to run slowly. Continuous-time error-controlled integration avoids such issues by automatically adjusting the time step to achieve a desired accuracy. But existing error-controlled integrators struggle with the stiff dynamics of contact, and cannot meet the speed and scalability requirements of modern robotics workflows. We introduce CENIC, a new continuous-time integrator that brings together recent advances in convex time-stepping and error-controlled integration, inheriting benefits from both continuous integration and discrete time-stepping. CENIC runs at fast real-time rates comparable to discrete-time robotics simulators like MuJoCo, Drake and Isaac Sim, while also providing guarantees on accuracy and convergence.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法通过利用机器人自身的结构特性显著提升了高维运动规划的效率和可靠性，适用于复杂动态环境中的实际任务。

Abstract: High degree-of-freedom dual-arm robots are becoming increasingly common due to their morphology enabling them to operate effectively in human environments. However, motion planning in real-time within unknown, changing environments remains a challenge for such robots due to the high dimensionality of the configuration space and the complex collision-avoidance constraints that must be obeyed. In this work, we propose a novel way to alleviate the curse of dimensionality by leveraging the structure imposed by shared joints (e.g. torso joints) in a dual-arm robot. First, we build two dynamic roadmaps (DRM) for each kinematic chain (i.e. left arm + torso, right arm + torso) with specific structure induced by the shared joints. Then, we show that we can leverage this structure to efficiently search through the composition of the two roadmaps and largely sidestep the curse of dimensionality. Finally, we run several experiments in a real-world grocery store with this motion planner on a 19 DoF mobile manipulation robot executing a grocery fulfillment task, achieving 0.4s average planning times with 99.9% success rate across more than 2000 motion plans.

Abstract: In mobile robot shared control, effectively understanding human motion intention is critical for seamless human-robot collaboration. This paper presents a novel shared control framework featuring planning-level intention prediction. A path replanning algorithm is designed to adjust the robot's desired trajectory according to inferred human intentions. To represent future motion intentions, we introduce the concept of an intention domain, which serves as a constraint for path replanning. The intention-domain prediction and path replanning problems are jointly formulated as a Markov Decision Process and solved through deep reinforcement learning. In addition, a Voronoi-based human trajectory generation algorithm is developed, allowing the model to be trained entirely in simulation without human participation or demonstration data. Extensive simulations and real-world user studies demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces operator workload and enhances safety, without compromising task efficiency compared with existing assistive teleoperation approaches.

Conclusion: SCOPE通过显式利用前沿信息和潜在探索机制，在零样本条件下显著提升了具身视觉导航的性能，为长视野目标导向导航提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Embodied visual navigation remains a challenging task, as agents must explore unknown environments with limited knowledge. Existing zero-shot studies have shown that incorporating memory mechanisms to support goal-directed behavior can improve long-horizon planning performance. However, they overlook visual frontier boundaries, which fundamentally dictate future trajectories and observations, and fall short of inferring the relationship between partial visual observations and navigation goals. In this paper, we propose Semantic Cognition Over Potential-based Exploration (SCOPE), a zero-shot framework that explicitly leverages frontier information to drive potential-based exploration, enabling more informed and goal-relevant decisions. SCOPE estimates exploration potential with a Vision-Language Model and organizes it into a spatio-temporal potential graph, capturing boundary dynamics to support long-horizon planning. In addition, SCOPE incorporates a self-reconsideration mechanism that revisits and refines prior decisions, enhancing reliability and reducing overconfident errors. Experimental results on two diverse embodied navigation tasks show that SCOPE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 4.6\% in accuracy. Further analysis demonstrates that its core components lead to improved calibration, stronger generalization, and higher decision quality.

Abstract: Decentralized collision avoidance remains a core challenge for scalable multi-robot systems. One of the promising approaches to tackle this problem is Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) -- a framework that is naturally suited to handle any robot motion model and provides strong theoretical guarantees. Still, in practice MPPI-based controller may provide suboptimal trajectories as its performance relies heavily on uninformed random sampling. In this work, we introduce CoRL-MPPI, a novel fusion of Cooperative Reinforcement Learning and MPPI to address this limitation. We train an action policy (approximated as deep neural network) in simulation that learns local cooperative collision avoidance behaviors. This learned policy is then embedded into the MPPI framework to guide its sampling distribution, biasing it towards more intelligent and cooperative actions. Notably, CoRL-MPPI preserves all the theoretical guarantees of regular MPPI. We evaluate our approach in dense, dynamic simulation environments against state-of-the-art baselines, including ORCA, BVC, and a multi-agent MPPI implementation. Our results demonstrate that CoRL-MPPI significantly improves navigation efficiency (measured by success rate and makespan) and safety, enabling agile and robust multi-robot navigation.

Conclusion: 通过赋予VLM更强的参与度与空间理解能力，可显著提升其在具身导航任务中的表现，为构建更智能的具身代理提供了可行路径。

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are set to transform robotic navigation, existing methods often underutilize their reasoning capabilities. To unlock the full potential of VLMs in robotics, we shift their role from passive observers to active strategists in the navigation process. Our framework outsources high-level planning to a VLM, which leverages its contextual understanding to guide a frontier-based exploration agent. This intelligent guidance is achieved through a trio of techniques: structured chain-of-thought prompting that elicits logical, step-by-step reasoning; dynamic inclusion of the agent's recent action history to prevent getting stuck in loops; and a novel capability that enables the VLM to interpret top-down obstacle maps alongside first-person views, thereby enhancing spatial awareness. When tested on challenging benchmarks like HM3D, Gibson, and MP3D, this method produces exceptionally direct and logical trajectories, marking a substantial improvement in navigation efficiency over existing approaches and charting a path toward more capable embodied agents.

Abstract: Autonomous driving holds transformative potential but remains fundamentally constrained by the limited perception and isolated decision-making with standalone intelligence. While recent multi-agent approaches introduce cooperation, they often focus merely on perception-level tasks, overlooking the alignment with downstream planning and control, or fall short in leveraging the full capacity of the recent emerging end-to-end autonomous driving. In this paper, we present UniMM-V2X, a novel end-to-end multi-agent framework that enables hierarchical cooperation across perception, prediction, and planning. At the core of our framework is a multi-level fusion strategy that unifies perception and prediction cooperation, allowing agents to share queries and reason cooperatively for consistent and safe decision-making. To adapt to diverse downstream tasks and further enhance the quality of multi-level fusion, we incorporate a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture to dynamically enhance the BEV representations. We further extend MoE into the decoder to better capture diverse motion patterns. Extensive experiments on the DAIR-V2X dataset demonstrate our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with a 39.7% improvement in perception accuracy, a 7.2% reduction in prediction error, and a 33.2% improvement in planning performance compared with UniV2X, showcasing the strength of our MoE-enhanced multi-level cooperative paradigm.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), effective path planning has become increasingly important. Although traditional search methods have been extensively applied, metaheuristic algorithms have gained popularity due to their efficiency and problem-specific heuristics. However, challenges such as premature convergence and lack of solution diversity still hinder their performance in complex scenarios. To address these issues, this paper proposes an Enhanced Multi-Strategy Dwarf Mongoose Optimization (EDMO) algorithm, tailored for three-dimensional UAV trajectory planning in dynamic and obstacle-rich environments. EDMO integrates three novel strategies: (1) a Dynamic Quantum Tunneling Optimization Strategy (DQTOS) to enable particles to probabilistically escape local optima; (2) a Bio-phototactic Dynamic Focusing Search Strategy (BDFSS) inspired by microbial phototaxis for adaptive local refinement; and (3) an Orthogonal Lens Opposition-Based Learning (OLOBL) strategy to enhance global exploration through structured dimensional recombination. EDMO is benchmarked on 39 standard test functions from CEC2017 and CEC2020, outperforming 14 advanced algorithms in convergence speed, robustness, and optimization accuracy. Furthermore, real-world validations on UAV three-dimensional path planning and three engineering design tasks confirm its practical applicability and effectiveness in field robotics missions requiring intelligent, adaptive, and time-efficient planning.

Conclusion: SMF-VO为传统方法提供了可扩展且高效的替代方案，特别适合移动机器人和可穿戴设备等应用场景。

Abstract: Traditional Visual Odometry (VO) and Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) methods rely on a 'pose-centric' paradigm, which computes absolute camera poses from the local map thus requires large-scale landmark maintenance and continuous map optimization. This approach is computationally expensive, limiting their real-time performance on resource-constrained devices. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Sparse Motion Field Visual Odometry (SMF-VO), a lightweight, 'motion-centric' framework. Our approach directly estimates instantaneous linear and angular velocity from sparse optical flow, bypassing the need for explicit pose estimation or expensive landmark tracking. We also employed a generalized 3D ray-based motion field formulation that works accurately with various camera models, including wide-field-of-view lenses. SMF-VO demonstrates superior efficiency and competitive accuracy on benchmark datasets, achieving over 100 FPS on a Raspberry Pi 5 using only a CPU. Our work establishes a scalable and efficient alternative to conventional methods, making it highly suitable for mobile robotics and wearable devices.

Information sharing through vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, enabled by a Dynamic Map platform built from vehicle and roadside sensor data, offers a promising solution. Real-world experiments with numerous infrastructure sensors incur high costs and regulatory challenges. Conventional single-host simulators lack the capacity for large-scale urban traffic scenarios. This paper proposes D-AWSIM, a distributed simulator that partitions its workload across multiple machines to support the simulation of extensive sensor deployment and dense traffic environments. A Dynamic Map generation framework on D-AWSIM enables researchers to explore information-sharing strategies without relying on physical testbeds. The evaluation shows that D-AWSIM increases throughput for vehicle count and LiDAR sensor processing substantially compared to a single-machine setup. Integration with Autoware demonstrates applicability for autonomous driving research.

TL;DR: 本文提出APEX，一种即插即用的强化学习框架扩展，通过引入衰减的动作先验，使四足机器人能从示范中高效学习自然运动，无需在部署时依赖参考数据，提升了样本效率、泛化能力和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于示范的运动跟踪方法在部署时依赖参考数据且需大量调参，限制了适应性和实用性，因此需要一种更高效、通用且免参考数据的方法。

Method: APEX将专家示范通过衰减的动作先验融入强化学习，初期引导探索方向，随后逐步释放策略自主探索；结合多批评者框架平衡任务性能与运动风格，并支持单一策略学习多种运动模式。

Result: 在仿真和Unitree Go2实体机器人上验证了APEX的有效性，实现了跨地形、速度的多样运动迁移，对奖励设计变化具有鲁棒性，显著提升训练稳定性与样本效率。

Conclusion: APEX通过引导式而非约束式的示范利用方式，实现了高效、稳定且通用的运动学习，为机器人技能获取提供了一种有前景的指导型强化学习范式。

Abstract: Learning natural, animal-like locomotion from demonstrations has become a core paradigm in legged robotics. Despite the recent advancements in motion tracking, most existing methods demand extensive tuning and rely on reference data during deployment, limiting adaptability. We present APEX (Action Priors enable Efficient Exploration), a plug-and-play extension to state-of-the-art motion tracking algorithms that eliminates any dependence on reference data during deployment, improves sample efficiency, and reduces parameter tuning effort. APEX integrates expert demonstrations directly into reinforcement learning (RL) by incorporating decaying action priors, which initially bias exploration toward expert demonstrations but gradually allow the policy to explore independently. This is combined with a multi-critic framework that balances task performance with motion style. Moreover, APEX enables a single policy to learn diverse motions and transfer reference-like styles across different terrains and velocities, while remaining robust to variations in reward design. We validate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments in both simulation and on a Unitree Go2 robot. By leveraging demonstrations to guide exploration during RL training, without imposing explicit bias toward them, APEX enables legged robots to learn with greater stability, efficiency, and generalization. We believe this approach paves the way for guidance-driven RL to boost natural skill acquisition in a wide array of robotic tasks, from locomotion to manipulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的软肌肉控制器在动态接触瞬态下难以保持力矩和刚度的独立控制。

Method: 基于统一的力定律和级联控制器结合解析逆动力学，使用共激活/偏置坐标实现独立调节。

Result: 仿真验证显示在软表面上稳定时间快200倍，硬表面上力减少81%，相比固定策略稳定性显著提高（22-54%）。

Conclusion: 该框架为肌肉骨骼对抗系统实现自适应阻抗控制提供了基础，有助于安全的人机交互。

Abstract: Antagonistic soft actuators built from artificial muscles (PAMs, HASELs, DEAs) promise plant-level torque-stiffness decoupling, yet existing controllers for soft muscles struggle to maintain independent control through dynamic contact transients. We present a unified framework enabling independent torque and stiffness commands in real-time for diverse soft actuator types. Our unified force law captures diverse soft muscle physics in a single model with sub-ms computation, while our cascaded controller with analytical inverse dynamics maintains decoupling despite model errors and disturbances. Using co-contraction/bias coordinates, the controller independently modulates torque via bias and stiffness via co-contraction-replicating biological impedance strategies. Simulation-based validation through contact experiments demonstrates maintained independence: 200x faster settling on soft surfaces, 81% force reduction on rigid surfaces, and stable interaction vs 22-54% stability for fixed policies. This framework provides a foundation for enabling musculoskeletal antagonistic systems to execute adaptive impedance control for safe human-robot interaction.

Abstract: In embodied intelligence, datasets play a pivotal role, serving as both a knowledge repository and a conduit for information transfer. The two most critical attributes of a dataset are the amount of information it provides and how easily this information can be learned by models. However, the multimodal nature of embodied data makes evaluating these properties particularly challenging. Prior work has largely focused on diversity, typically counting tasks and scenes or evaluating isolated modalities, which fails to provide a comprehensive picture of dataset diversity. On the other hand, the learnability of datasets has received little attention and is usually assessed post-hoc through model training, an expensive, time-consuming process that also lacks interpretability, offering little guidance on how to improve a dataset. In this work, we address both challenges by introducing two principled, data-driven tools. First, we construct a unified multimodal representation for each data sample and, based on it, propose diversity entropy, a continuous measure that characterizes the amount of information contained in a dataset. Second, we introduce the first interpretable, data-driven algorithm to efficiently quantify dataset learnability without training, enabling researchers to assess a dataset's learnability immediately upon its release. We validate our algorithm on both simulated and real-world embodied datasets, demonstrating that it yields faithful, actionable insights that enable researchers to jointly improve diversity and learnability. We hope this work provides a foundation for designing higher-quality datasets that advance the development of embodied intelligence.

Motivation: 现有数据驱动方法依赖大量训练数据，忽视了几何推理，在新场景中表现不佳，且对机器人-目标关系建模低效，导致资源浪费。

Method: 提出RGMP框架，包括引入几何先验的视觉语言模型（Geometric-prior Skill Selector）用于技能选择，以及自适应递归高斯网络（Adaptive Recursive Gaussian Network）实现高效运动合成。

Conclusion: RGMP通过几何语义推理与递归高斯适应机制，显著提升了跨域泛化能力与数据效率，为人形机器人技能学习提供了新方向。

Abstract: Humanoid robots exhibit significant potential in executing diverse human-level skills. However, current research predominantly relies on data-driven approaches that necessitate extensive training datasets to achieve robust multimodal decision-making capabilities and generalizable visuomotor control. These methods raise concerns due to the neglect of geometric reasoning in unseen scenarios and the inefficient modeling of robot-target relationships within the training data, resulting in significant waste of training resources. To address these limitations, we present the Recurrent Geometric-prior Multimodal Policy (RGMP), an end-to-end framework that unifies geometric-semantic skill reasoning with data-efficient visuomotor control. For perception capabilities, we propose the Geometric-prior Skill Selector, which infuses geometric inductive biases into a vision language model, producing adaptive skill sequences for unseen scenes with minimal spatial common sense tuning. To achieve data-efficient robotic motion synthesis, we introduce the Adaptive Recursive Gaussian Network, which parameterizes robot-object interactions as a compact hierarchy of Gaussian processes that recursively encode multi-scale spatial relationships, yielding dexterous, data-efficient motion synthesis even from sparse demonstrations. Evaluated on both our humanoid robot and desktop dual-arm robot, the RGMP framework achieves 87% task success in generalization tests and exhibits 5x greater data efficiency than the state-of-the-art model. This performance underscores its superior cross-domain generalization, enabled by geometric-semantic reasoning and recursive-Gaussion adaptation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出LODESTAR，一种新的LiDAR-inertial里程计方法，通过退化感知的自适应Schmidt-Kalman滤波和数据利用模块，提升在退化环境下的定位精度与鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在走廊、高空飞行等退化环境中，LiDAR数据稀疏或不平衡，导致状态估计性能下降，现有LIO方法难以应对。

Method: 设计DA-ASKF模块，采用滑动窗口和退化感知模式，将状态分为主动与固定两类，利用Schmidt-Kalman更新部分优化；同时设计DA-DE模块，基于可定位性和雅可比矩阵条件数选择性利用测量数据。

Result: 实验表明，LODESTAR在多种退化环境下优于现有的LiDAR里程计方法和退化感知模块，具有更高的精度和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LODESTAR通过引入退化感知的约束优化和数据筛选机制，有效缓解了LiDAR数据稀疏与不平衡问题，显著提升了LIO系统在退化环境中的性能。

Abstract: LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO) has been widely used in robotics due to its high accuracy. However, its performance degrades in degenerate environments, such as long corridors and high-altitude flights, where LiDAR measurements are imbalanced or sparse, leading to ill-posed state estimation. In this letter, we present LODESTAR, a novel LIO method that addresses these degeneracies through two key modules: degeneracy-aware adaptive Schmidt-Kalman filter (DA-ASKF) and degeneracy-aware data exploitation (DA-DE). DA-ASKF employs a sliding window to utilize past states and measurements as additional constraints. Specifically, it introduces degeneracy-aware sliding modes that adaptively classify states as active or fixed based on their degeneracy level. Using Schmidt-Kalman update, it partially optimizes active states while preserving fixed states. These fixed states influence the update of active states via their covariances, serving as reference anchors--akin to a lodestar. Additionally, DA-DE prunes less-informative measurements from active states and selectively exploits measurements from fixed states, based on their localizability contribution and the condition number of the Jacobian matrix. Consequently, DA-ASKF enables degeneracy-aware constrained optimization and mitigates measurement sparsity, while DA-DE addresses measurement imbalance. Experimental results show that LODESTAR outperforms existing LiDAR-based odometry methods and degeneracy-aware modules in terms of accuracy and robustness under various degenerate conditions.

Conclusion: 大规模人类动作数据可通过自动化流程转化为机器人可学习的高质量动作表示，SCHUR框架展示了数据规模对人形机器人高层控制学习的积极影响。

Abstract: Data scaling has long remained a critical bottleneck in robot learning. For humanoid robots, human videos and motion data are abundant and widely available, offering a free and large-scale data source. Besides, the semantics related to the motions enable modality alignment and high-level robot control learning. However, how to effectively mine raw video, extract robot-learnable representations, and leverage them for scalable learning remains an open problem. To address this, we introduce Humanoid-Union, a large-scale dataset generated through an autonomous pipeline, comprising over 260 hours of diverse, high-quality humanoid robot motion data with semantic annotations derived from human motion videos. The dataset can be further expanded via the same pipeline. Building on this data resource, we propose SCHUR, a scalable learning framework designed to explore the impact of large-scale data on high-level control in humanoid robots. Experimental results demonstrate that SCHUR achieves high robot motion generation quality and strong text-motion alignment under data and model scaling, with 37\% reconstruction improvement under MPJPE and 25\% alignment improvement under FID comparing with previous methods. Its effectiveness is further validated through deployment in real-world humanoid robot.

Conclusion: UMIGen有效提升了机器人操作数据的采集效率与通用性，无需后期处理即可实现跨平台迁移。

Abstract: Data-driven robotic learning faces an obvious dilemma: robust policies demand large-scale, high-quality demonstration data, yet collecting such data remains a major challenge owing to high operational costs, dependence on specialized hardware, and the limited spatial generalization capability of current methods. The Universal Manipulation Interface (UMI) relaxes the strict hardware requirements for data collection, but it is restricted to capturing only RGB images of a scene and omits the 3D geometric information on which many tasks rely. Inspired by DemoGen, we propose UMIGen, a unified framework that consists of two key components: (1) Cloud-UMI, a handheld data collection device that requires no visual SLAM and simultaneously records point cloud observation-action pairs; and (2) a visibility-aware optimization mechanism that extends the DemoGen pipeline to egocentric 3D observations by generating only points within the camera's field of view. These two components enable efficient data generation that aligns with real egocentric observations and can be directly transferred across different robot embodiments without any post-processing. Experiments in both simulated and real-world settings demonstrate that UMIGen supports strong cross-embodiment generalization and accelerates data collection in diverse manipulation tasks.

Motivation: 由于机器人特定数据收集成本高昂，而人类动作数据丰富但存在形态差异和缺乏动力学信息的问题，难以直接用于机器人控制，因此需要一种能桥接这一差距的方法。

Method: 提出SPIDER框架，利用人类演示提供全局任务结构和目标，结合大规模基于物理的采样与课程式虚拟接触引导，优化生成符合动力学且具有正确接触序列的机器人轨迹。

Result: 在9种不同人形/灵巧手结构和6个数据集上验证，相比标准采样成功率提升18%，比强化学习基线快10倍，并生成了包含240万帧的动力学可行机器人数据集。

Conclusion: SPIDER作为一种通用的基于物理的重定向方法，能够处理多样质量的输入数据，生成高质量、多样化的机器人轨迹数据，有效支持强化学习等策略学习方法。

Abstract: Learning dexterous and agile policy for humanoid and dexterous hand control requires large-scale demonstrations, but collecting robot-specific data is prohibitively expensive. In contrast, abundant human motion data is readily available from motion capture, videos, and virtual reality, which could help address the data scarcity problem. However, due to the embodiment gap and missing dynamic information like force and torque, these demonstrations cannot be directly executed on robots. To bridge this gap, we propose Scalable Physics-Informed DExterous Retargeting (SPIDER), a physics-based retargeting framework to transform and augment kinematic-only human demonstrations to dynamically feasible robot trajectories at scale. Our key insight is that human demonstrations should provide global task structure and objective, while large-scale physics-based sampling with curriculum-style virtual contact guidance should refine trajectories to ensure dynamical feasibility and correct contact sequences. SPIDER scales across diverse 9 humanoid/dexterous hand embodiments and 6 datasets, improving success rates by 18% compared to standard sampling, while being 10X faster than reinforcement learning (RL) baselines, and enabling the generation of a 2.4M frames dynamic-feasible robot dataset for policy learning. As a universal physics-based retargeting method, SPIDER can work with diverse quality data and generate diverse and high-quality data to enable efficient policy learning with methods like RL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLA模型依赖专家示范，难以从失败中学习；而强化学习虽能自我改进，但在真实机器人上样本复杂度高。因此需要一种高效且无需真实环境交互的训练方法。

Method: 提出WMPO框架，采用基于像素的预测而非潜在空间建模，使其‘想象’轨迹与预训练的VLA特征对齐，并在策略上执行GRPO以实现更强的在线策略优化。

Result: 在仿真和真实机器人实验中，WMPO显著提高了样本效率，实现了更优的整体性能，展现出自纠正等涌现行为，并具备强大的泛化和终身学习能力。

Conclusion: WMPO为VLA模型提供了一种高效的强化学习路径，无需真实环境交互即可实现高性能、自修正和持续学习，推动了通用机器人操作的发展。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown strong potential for general-purpose robotic manipulation, but their reliance on expert demonstrations limits their ability to learn from failures and perform self-corrections. Reinforcement learning (RL) addresses these through self-improving interactions with the physical environment, but suffers from high sample complexity on real robots. We introduce World-Model-based Policy Optimization (WMPO), a principled framework for on-policy VLA RL without interacting with the real environment. In contrast to widely used latent world models, WMPO focuses on pixel-based predictions that align the "imagined" trajectories with the VLA features pretrained with web-scale images. Crucially, WMPO enables the policy to perform on-policy GRPO that provides stronger performance than the often-used off-policy methods. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-robot settings demonstrate that WMPO (i) substantially improves sample efficiency, (ii) achieves stronger overall performance, (iii) exhibits emergent behaviors such as self-correction, and (iv) demonstrates robust generalization and lifelong learning capabilities.

Conclusion: MAP-VLA通过引入记忆增强机制，有效提升了预训练VLA模型在长视野任务中的性能，且具有轻量、灵活和易于集成的优点。

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved remarkable success in improving robustness and generalization for end-to-end robotic manipulation. However, these models struggle with long-horizon tasks due to their lack of memory and reliance solely on immediate sensory inputs. To address this limitation, we propose Memory-Augmented Prompting for Vision-Language-Action model (MAP-VLA), a novel framework that empowers pre-trained VLA models with demonstration-derived memory prompts to augment action generation for long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks. To achieve this, MAP-VLA first constructs a memory library from historical demonstrations, where each memory unit captures information about a specific stage of a task. These memory units are implemented as learnable soft prompts optimized through prompt tuning. Then, during real-time task execution, MAP-VLA retrieves relevant memory through trajectory similarity matching and dynamically integrates it into the VLA model for augmented action generation. Importantly, this prompt tuning and retrieval augmentation approach operates as a plug-and-play module for a frozen VLA model, offering a lightweight and flexible solution to improve task performance. Experimental results show that MAP-VLA delivers up to 7.0% absolute performance gains in the simulation benchmark and 25.0% on real robot evaluations for long-horizon tasks, surpassing the current state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SpatialActor通过显式解耦语义与几何并融合多源几何信息，有效提升了机器人操作在真实环境中的鲁棒性和泛化性能。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation requires precise spatial understanding to interact with objects in the real world. Point-based methods suffer from sparse sampling, leading to the loss of fine-grained semantics. Image-based methods typically feed RGB and depth into 2D backbones pre-trained on 3D auxiliary tasks, but their entangled semantics and geometry are sensitive to inherent depth noise in real-world that disrupts semantic understanding. Moreover, these methods focus on high-level geometry while overlooking low-level spatial cues essential for precise interaction. We propose SpatialActor, a disentangled framework for robust robotic manipulation that explicitly decouples semantics and geometry. The Semantic-guided Geometric Module adaptively fuses two complementary geometry from noisy depth and semantic-guided expert priors. Also, a Spatial Transformer leverages low-level spatial cues for accurate 2D-3D mapping and enables interaction among spatial features. We evaluate SpatialActor on multiple simulation and real-world scenarios across 50+ tasks. It achieves state-of-the-art performance with 87.4% on RLBench and improves by 13.9% to 19.4% under varying noisy conditions, showing strong robustness. Moreover, it significantly enhances few-shot generalization to new tasks and maintains robustness under various spatial perturbations. Project Page: https://shihao1895.github.io/SpatialActor

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于二阶自动微分的曲率正则化方法计算开销大，需要更高效的替代方案。

Method: 使用具有O(h^2)截断误差的有限差分模板近似二阶导数，替代高斯曲率和秩缺陷损失中的Hessian计算。

Result: 实验表明该方法在重建精度上与自动微分相当，但GPU内存和训练时间最多减少一半，并在稀疏、不完整和非CAD数据上表现出鲁棒性和通用性。

Conclusion: 所提出的有限差分方法为曲率感知的SDF学习提供了一种高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a finite-difference framework for curvature regularization in neural signed distance field (SDF) learning. Existing approaches enforce curvature priors using full Hessian information obtained via second-order automatic differentiation, which is accurate but computationally expensive. Others reduced this overhead by avoiding explicit Hessian assembly, but still required higher-order differentiation. In contrast, our method replaces these operations with lightweight finite-difference stencils that approximate second derivatives using the well known Taylor expansion with a truncation error of O(h^2), and can serve as drop-in replacements for Gaussian curvature and rank-deficiency losses. Experiments demonstrate that our finite-difference variants achieve reconstruction fidelity comparable to their automatic-differentiation counterparts, while reducing GPU memory usage and training time by up to a factor of two. Additional tests on sparse, incomplete, and non-CAD data confirm that the proposed formulation is robust and general, offering an efficient and scalable alternative for curvature-aware SDF learning.

Conclusion: 所提方法通过优化点光源集合和自由曲面设计，有效提升了在真实光源条件下的光场控制精度，适用于复杂照明场景下的光学设计。

Abstract: Designing freeform surfaces to control light based on real-world illumination patterns is challenging, as existing caustic lens designs often assume oversimplified point or parallel light sources. We propose representing surface light sources using an optimized set of point sources, whose parameters are fitted to the real light source's illumination using a novel differentiable rendering framework. Our physically-based rendering approach simulates light transmission using flux, without requiring prior knowledge of the light source's intensity distribution. To efficiently explore the light source parameter space during optimization, we apply a contraction mapping that converts the constrained problem into an unconstrained one. Using the optimized light source model, we then design the freeform lens shape considering flux consistency and normal integrability. Simulations and physical experiments show our method more accurately represents real surface light sources compared to point-source approximations, yielding caustic lenses that produce images closely matching the target light distributions.

Abstract: Early and accurate detection of cardiac arrhythmias is vital for timely diagnosis and intervention. We propose a lightweight deep learning model combining 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), attention mechanisms, and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) for classifying arrhythmias from both 12-lead and single-lead ECGs. Evaluated on the CPSC 2018 dataset, the model addresses class imbalance using a class-weighted loss and demonstrates superior accuracy and F1- scores over baseline models. With only 0.945 million parameters, our model is well-suited for real-time deployment in wearable health monitoring systems.

### [162] [Accelerating Training Speed of Tiny Recursive Models via Curriculum Guided Adaptive Recursion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08653)
*Kaleem Ullah Qasim,Jiashu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CGAR是一种新的训练方法，通过在架构深度上应用课程学习来提高递归推理模型的训练效率，显著减少计算成本并保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的递归推理模型虽然性能优异，但训练耗时且计算开销大（约36 GPU小时），限制了其广泛应用。需要一种更高效的训练方法以降低资源需求。

Method: 提出CGAR方法，包含两个核心组件：渐进深度课程（Progressive Depth Curriculum），在训练过程中动态增加递归深度；分层监督加权（Hierarchical Supervision Weighting），按指数衰减方式调整各步监督损失权重，匹配梯度衰减特性。

Result: 在Sudoku-Extreme数据集上，CGAR将训练时间从10.93小时缩短至6.38小时（提速1.71倍，成本降低42%），准确率仅下降0.63%。消融实验显示，仅使用渐进深度课程即可实现2.26倍加速且准确率达85.47%，表现出帕累托改进。模型推理效率更高，停机准确率为100%，推理步数减少11%。

Conclusion: CGAR通过在架构深度上引入结构化的课程学习，显著提升了递归推理模型的训练和推理效率，使其可在普通硬件上高效训练，推动该类模型的普及与研究。

Abstract: Recursive reasoning models achieve remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks through iterative refinement, enabling tiny networks to match large language models thousands of times their size. However, training remains computationally expensive, prior work reporting approximately 36 GPU-hours per dataset, limiting broader adoption and research. We propose CGAR, a novel training methodology that applies curriculum learning to architectural depth rather than traditional data ordering. CGAR introduces two synergistic components: Progressive Depth Curriculum dynamically adjusts recursion depth from shallow to deep configurations during training, preventing early overfitting while reducing computational cost, and Hierarchical Supervision Weighting applies exponentially decaying importance to supervision steps, aligning loss weighting with observed gradient magnitude decay. On Sudoku-Extreme with 423,168 test puzzles, CGAR achieves 1.71x training speedup (10.93 to 6.38 hours, 42% cost reduction) with only 0.63% accuracy drop (86.65% to 86.02%). Systematic ablations reveal Progressive Depth Curriculum alone achieves 2.26x speedup with 85.47% accuracy, demonstrating a rare Pareto improvement where architectural curriculum simultaneously enhances training efficiency and solution quality. CGAR-trained models exhibit superior inference efficiency with 100% halting accuracy and 11% fewer reasoning steps. Our work demonstrates that principled curriculum on architectural depth enables efficient training of recursive reasoning models on modest hardware.

*Rui Zhu,Yuexing Peng,George C. Alexandropoulos,Wenbo Wang,Wei Xiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出PhyKAN，一种基于Kolmogorov-Arnold定理的可学习基函数网络，用于电磁建模，兼具物理一致性与高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统矩量法（MoM）依赖静态几何定义的基函数（如RWG），缺乏灵活性和适应性，限制了电磁建模的表达能力。

Method: 将RWG基函数视为Kolmogorov-Arnold表示定理的静态分段线性实现，提出PhyKAN：一种融合局部KAN分支与嵌入格林函数先验的全局分支的物理信息神经网络，从EFIE出发实现可学习、自适应的基表示。

Result: 在典型几何结构上，PhyKAN实现了低于0.01的重构误差，并能准确进行无监督雷达散射截面预测。

Conclusion: PhyKAN为经典电磁求解器与现代神经网络模型之间提供了可解释且物理一致的桥梁。

Abstract: The Method of Moments (MoM) is constrained by the usage of static, geometry-defined basis functions, such as the Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG) basis. This letter reframes electromagnetic modeling around a learnable basis representation rather than solving for the coefficients over a fixed basis. We first show that the RWG basis is essentially a static and piecewise-linear realization of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Inspired by this insight, we propose PhyKAN, a physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) that generalizes RWG into a learnable and adaptive basis family. Derived from the EFIE, PhyKAN integrates a local KAN branch with a global branch embedded with Green's function priors to preserve physical consistency. It is demonstrated that, across canonical geometries, PhyKAN achieves sub-0.01 reconstruction errors as well as accurate, unsupervised radar cross section predictions, offering an interpretable, physics-consistent bridge between classical solvers and modern neural network models for electromagnetic modeling.

Motivation: 提升表格数据建模能力，支持更大规模数据集并增强在工业标准基准上的表现。

Method: 基于前代TabPFN和TabPFNv2，构建更强大的TabPFN-2.5模型，并引入蒸馏引擎将其压缩为MLP或树集成模型以适应生产环境。

Abstract: The first tabular foundation model, TabPFN, and its successor TabPFNv2 have impacted tabular AI substantially, with dozens of methods building on it and hundreds of applications across different use cases. This report introduces TabPFN-2.5, the next generation of our tabular foundation model, built for datasets with up to 50,000 data points and 2,000 features, a 20x increase in data cells compared to TabPFNv2. TabPFN-2.5 is now the leading method for the industry standard benchmark TabArena (which contains datasets with up to 100,000 training data points), substantially outperforming tuned tree-based models and matching the accuracy of AutoGluon 1.4, a complex four-hour tuned ensemble that even includes the previous TabPFNv2. Remarkably, default TabPFN-2.5 has a 100% win rate against default XGBoost on small to medium-sized classification datasets (<=10,000 data points, 500 features) and a 87% win rate on larger datasets up to 100K samples and 2K features (85% for regression). For production use cases, we introduce a new distillation engine that converts TabPFN-2.5 into a compact MLP or tree ensemble, preserving most of its accuracy while delivering orders-of-magnitude lower latency and plug-and-play deployment. This new release will immediately strengthen the performance of the many applications and methods already built on the TabPFN ecosystem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值求解器计算成本高，数据驱动方法存在误差累积和物理不一致问题，尤其在多物理场和复杂几何中表现不佳。

Method: 设计基于PDE引导消息传递的图神经网络，将对流、粘性、扩散等物理过程嵌入不同的消息函数，并采用分层结构捕捉多尺度特征，结合物理正则化损失增强物理一致性。

Conclusion: PEGNet通过将物理先验嵌入网络结构与训练过程，有效提升了数据驱动物理仿真的稳定性与可靠性，具有在复杂多物理场系统中应用的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulations of physical phenomena governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) are important for scientific and engineering progress. While traditional numerical solvers are powerful, they are often computationally expensive. Recently, data-driven methods have emerged as alternatives, but they frequently suffer from error accumulation and limited physical consistency, especially in multiphysics and complex geometries. To address these challenges, we propose PEGNet, a Physics-Embedded Graph Network that incorporates PDE-guided message passing to redesign the graph neural network architecture. By embedding key PDE dynamics like convection, viscosity, and diffusion into distinct message functions, the model naturally integrates physical constraints into its forward propagation, producing more stable and physically consistent solutions. Additionally, a hierarchical architecture is employed to capture multi-scale features, and physical regularization is integrated into the loss function to further enforce adherence to governing physics. We evaluated PEGNet on benchmarks, including custom datasets for respiratory airflow and drug delivery, showing significant improvements in long-term prediction accuracy and physical consistency over existing methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FAIRPLAI 是一个集成了人类监督的机器学习框架，旨在平衡准确性、公平性和隐私保护，通过透明化权衡、支持利益相关者交互输入和差分隐私审计，提升社会关键应用中系统的可信赖性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习在医疗、金融、招聘等关键领域的应用增加，仅追求准确性已不足，需同时兼顾公平性、隐私保护和人类可问责性，但三者之间存在冲突，现有方法难以协调。

Method: 提出 FAIRPLAI 框架：(1) 构建隐私-公平性前沿以显式展示准确率、隐私与群体公平间的权衡；(2) 支持利益相关者交互式设定公平标准和操作点；(3) 引入差分隐私审计循环，允许人类审查模型解释和边缘案例而不泄露个体数据。

Result: 在基准数据集上，FAIRPLAI 在保持强隐私保护的同时，相比自动化基线显著降低了公平性差异，并提供了可解释的决策流程。

Conclusion: FAIRPLAI 通过在关键环节嵌入人类判断，为实现高效、负责任且可信的机器学习系统提供了一条可行路径。

Abstract: As machine learning systems move from theory to practice, they are increasingly tasked with decisions that affect healthcare access, financial opportunities, hiring, and public services. In these contexts, accuracy is only one piece of the puzzle - models must also be fair to different groups, protect individual privacy, and remain accountable to stakeholders. Achieving all three is difficult: differential privacy can unintentionally worsen disparities, fairness interventions often rely on sensitive data that privacy restricts, and automated pipelines ignore that fairness is ultimately a human and contextual judgment. We introduce FAIRPLAI (Fair and Private Learning with Active Human Influence), a practical framework that integrates human oversight into the design and deployment of machine learning systems. FAIRPLAI works in three ways: (1) it constructs privacy-fairness frontiers that make trade-offs between accuracy, privacy guarantees, and group outcomes transparent; (2) it enables interactive stakeholder input, allowing decision-makers to select fairness criteria and operating points that reflect their domain needs; and (3) it embeds a differentially private auditing loop, giving humans the ability to review explanations and edge cases without compromising individual data security. Applied to benchmark datasets, FAIRPLAI consistently preserves strong privacy protections while reducing fairness disparities relative to automated baselines. More importantly, it provides a straightforward, interpretable process for practitioners to manage competing demands of accuracy, privacy, and fairness in socially impactful applications. By embedding human judgment where it matters most, FAIRPLAI offers a pathway to machine learning systems that are effective, responsible, and trustworthy in practice.

TL;DR: 本文提出了LLM-ABS框架，用于研究大语言模型（LLM）代理在不同系统提示下的行为，特别是在公平性偏好和提示敏感性方面的表现，并通过分析语言特征来理解其决策背后的推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究忽视了系统提示对LLM行为的影响，且结果对提示变化敏感，缺乏稳健性基线。因此需要一个更可靠的框架来研究LLM代理的复杂行为。

Method: 提出LLM-ABS框架，通过设计中性提示变体，系统地分析不同系统提示如何影响LLM在独裁者博弈中的行为，并结合语言特征分析来探究其响应模式。

Result: 发现LLM代理普遍表现出较强的公平偏好，系统提示对其行为有显著影响，且不同模型在表达方式上存在差异；提示敏感性仍是挑战。

Conclusion: LLM-ABS框架为研究LLM代理行为提供了更稳健的基础，强调了系统提示的重要性，并为未来行为研究提供了可复现的方法论支持。

Abstract: In behavioral sciences, experiments such as the ultimatum game are conducted to assess preferences for fairness or self-interest of study participants. In the dictator game, a simplified version of the ultimatum game where only one of two players makes a single decision, the dictator unilaterally decides how to split a fixed sum of money between themselves and the other player. Although recent studies have explored behavioral patterns of AI agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) instructed to adopt different personas, we question the robustness of these results. In particular, many of these studies overlook the role of the system prompt - the underlying instructions that shape the model's behavior - and do not account for how sensitive results can be to slight changes in prompts. However, a robust baseline is essential when studying highly complex behavioral aspects of LLMs. To overcome previous limitations, we propose the LLM agent behavior study (LLM-ABS) framework to (i) explore how different system prompts influence model behavior, (ii) get more reliable insights into agent preferences by using neutral prompt variations, and (iii) analyze linguistic features in responses to open-ended instructions by LLM agents to better understand the reasoning behind their behavior. We found that agents often exhibit a strong preference for fairness, as well as a significant impact of the system prompt on their behavior. From a linguistic perspective, we identify that models express their responses differently. Although prompt sensitivity remains a persistent challenge, our proposed framework demonstrates a robust foundation for LLM agent behavior studies.

Motivation: 由于历史数据限制，实证的eMFD模型较为稀缺，且缺乏对城市交通排放与交通变量之间关系的深入理解，尤其是在不同地理位置和基础设施条件下的变化。

Method: 基于大规模、细粒度的探针车辆交通与排放数据，采用机器学习方法建立网络级排放率与交通变量之间的关系模型，并分析其在网络特征、基础设施、土地利用和车辆特性上的空间依赖性。

Conclusion: 该模型有助于交通管理部门量化特定出行需求下的碳排放，并通过位置定制化的交通管理与规划决策，有效缓解网络级排放和城市拥堵。

Abstract: Urban congestions cause inefficient movement of vehicles and exacerbate greenhouse gas emissions and urban air pollution. Macroscopic emission fundamental diagram (eMFD)captures an orderly relationship among emission and aggregated traffic variables at the network level, allowing for real-time monitoring of region-wide emissions and optimal allocation of travel demand to existing networks, reducing urban congestion and associated emissions. However, empirically derived eMFD models are sparse due to historical data limitation. Leveraging a large-scale and granular traffic and emission data derived from probe vehicles, this study is the first to apply machine learning methods to predict the network wide emission rate to traffic relationship in U.S. urban areas at a large scale. The analysis framework and insights developed in this work generate data-driven eMFDs and a deeper understanding of their location dependence on network, infrastructure, land use, and vehicle characteristics, enabling transportation authorities to measure carbon emissions from urban transport of given travel demand and optimize location specific traffic management and planning decisions to mitigate network-wide emissions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图粗化在保持图结构信息的同时减少计算复杂度，但现有方法在保留全局几何结构方面存在不足，因此需要一种能有效衡量合并失真的新方法。

Method: 基于Gromov-Wasserstein距离设计新的失真表示，提出两种算法：Greedy Pair Coarsening (GPC) 迭代合并局部失真最小的节点对；k-means Greedy Pair Coarsening (KGPC) 利用基于失真度量的聚类直接合并节点簇。

Result: 在六个大规模数据集和下游聚类任务中验证了方法的有效性，结果表明所提方法在多种参数和场景下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的GPC和KGPC算法在图粗化过程中能更好地保持图的几何结构，在性能上优于现有方法，具有良好的应用前景。

Abstract: We study the problem of graph coarsening within the Gromov-Wasserstein geometry. Specifically, we propose two algorithms that leverage a novel representation of the distortion induced by merging pairs of nodes. The first method, termed Greedy Pair Coarsening (GPC), iteratively merges pairs of nodes that locally minimize a measure of distortion until the desired size is achieved. The second method, termed $k$-means Greedy Pair Coarsening (KGPC), leverages clustering based on pairwise distortion metrics to directly merge clusters of nodes. We provide conditions guaranteeing optimal coarsening for our methods and validate their performance on six large-scale datasets and a downstream clustering task. Results show that the proposed methods outperform existing approaches on a wide range of parameters and scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言作为LLM智能体间通信媒介存在信息损失问题，限制了协作推理能力，因此需要更丰富、高效的通信方式。

Method: 利用LLM的最后一层隐状态作为‘思维’表征进行直接传输，并在隐空间内完成通信压缩与推理，形成端到端的隐空间通信机制。

Result: 实验表明Interlat优于微调的思维链提示和单智能体基线，在促进探索行为的同时保持高性能；进一步压缩可加速推理且不显著损失性能。

Conclusion: Interlat验证了完全基于隐空间的智能体间通信的可行性，为高效多智能体协作提供了新方向。

Abstract: While natural language is the de facto communication medium for LLM-based agents, it presents a fundamental constraint. The process of downsampling rich, internal latent states into discrete tokens inherently limits the depth and nuance of information that can be transmitted, thereby hindering collaborative problem-solving. Inspired by human mind-reading, we propose Interlat (Inter-agent Latent Space Communication), a paradigm that leverages the last hidden states of an LLM as a representation of its mind for direct transmission (termed latent communication). An additional compression process further compresses latent communication via entirely latent space reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that Interlat outperforms both fine-tuned chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and single-agent baselines, promoting more exploratory behavior and enabling genuine utilization of latent information. Further compression not only substantially accelerates inference but also maintains competitive performance through an efficient information-preserving mechanism. We position this work as a feasibility study of entirely latent space inter-agent communication, and our results highlight its potential, offering valuable insights for future research.

Abstract: Using Frequency-domain Holographic Reduced Representations (FHRRs), we extend a Vector-Symbolic Architecture (VSA) encoding of Lisp 1.5 with primitives for arithmetic operations using Residue Hyperdimensional Computing (RHC). Encoding a Turing-complete syntax over a high-dimensional vector space increases the expressivity of neural network states, enabling network states to contain arbitrarily structured representations that are inherently interpretable. We discuss the potential applications of the VSA encoding in machine learning tasks, as well as the importance of encoding structured representations and designing neural networks whose behavior is sensitive to the structure of their representations in virtue of attaining more general intelligent agents than exist at present.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BayesQ 是一种不确定性引导的后训练量化框架，通过优化后验期望损失来设计低比特量化，相较于现有方法在 ResNet-50 和 BERT 上显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统后训练量化方法忽略模型权重的不确定性，导致低比特量化时性能下降。BayesQ 旨在利用贝叶斯后验不确定性来指导量化过程，以最小化任务相关的期望损失。

Method: BayesQ 构建轻量级高斯后验分布（默认为对角拉普拉斯，可选 K-FAC/低秩），利用后验协方差进行白化处理，设计最小化后验期望失真的码本，并通过贪心背包算法在全局预算下按每比特边际期望损失减少分配混合精度。对于标量量化器，后验期望 MSE 可解析求解；任务感知代理通过小校准集上的短蒙特卡洛估计。可选的蒸馏步骤使量化模型与后验预测教师对齐。

Result: 在平均比特数为 3.0/3.5/4.0 的情况下，BayesQ 在 ResNet-50（ImageNet）上比 GPTQ 提高 +1.5/+0.7/+0.3 个百分点，在 BERT-base（GLUE）上提高 +1.1/+0.4/+0.2 分，且预处理开销与 GPTQ 相当。

Conclusion: BayesQ 将低比特量化重新定义为不确定性感知的风险最小化问题，提供了一种实用、高效的后训练量化新范式。

Abstract: We present BayesQ, an uncertainty-guided post-training quantization framework that is the first to optimize quantization under the posterior expected loss. BayesQ fits a lightweight Gaussian posterior over weights (diagonal Laplace by default; optional K-FAC/low-rank), whitens by the posterior covariance, designs codebooks to minimize posterior-expected distortion, and allocates mixed precision via a greedy knapsack that maximizes marginal expected-loss reduction per bit under a global budget. For scalar quantizers, posterior-expected MSE yields closed-form tables; task-aware proxies are handled by short Monte Carlo on a small calibration set. An optional calibration-only distillation aligns the quantized model with the posterior predictive teacher. At matched average bits/weight of 3.0/3.5/4.0, BayesQ improves over strong PTQ baselines on ResNet-50 (ImageNet) and BERT-base (GLUE) e.g., vs. GPTQ by $+1.5/+0.7/+0.3$ top-1 percentage points on RN50 and $+1.1/+0.4/+0.2$ GLUE points on BERT, while requiring one-time preprocessing comparable to a GPTQ pass. BayesQ reframes low-bit quantization as uncertainty-aware risk minimization in a practical, post-training pipeline.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于物理信息机器学习的Lyapunov函数推断方法（LyapInf），通过系统轨迹数据直接推断Lyapunov函数，无需系统方程先验知识，从而估计动力系统的稳定性区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖系统方程显式形式来构造Lyapunov函数并估计稳定性区域，但在许多实际系统（如航空航天）中系统方程未知或难以建模，因此需要一种不依赖方程先验知识的数据驱动方法。

Method: 提出LyapInf方法，假设Lyapunov函数为二次形式，通过最小化Zubov方程的残差，利用系统轨迹数据拟合未知的二次算子，从而推断Lyapunov函数。

Conclusion: LyapInf是一种有效的黑箱系统稳定性分析方法，能够在缺乏系统动力学方程的情况下，从数据中推断Lyapunov函数并估计稳定性区域。

Abstract: In the design and operation of complex dynamical systems, it is essential to ensure that all state trajectories of the dynamical system converge to a desired equilibrium within a guaranteed stability region. Yet, for many practical systems -- especially in aerospace -- this region cannot be determined a priori and is often challenging to compute. One of the most common methods for computing the stability region is to identify a Lyapunov function. A Lyapunov function is a positive function whose time derivative along system trajectories is non-positive, which provides a sufficient condition for stability and characterizes an estimated stability region. However, existing methods of characterizing a stability region via a Lyapunov function often rely on explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In this work, we present a new physics-informed machine learning method of characterizing an estimated stability region by inferring a Lyapunov function from system trajectory data that treats the dynamical system as a black box and does not require explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In our presented Lyapunov function Inference method (LyapInf), we propose a quadratic form for the unknown Lyapunov function and fit the unknown quadratic operator to system trajectory data by minimizing the average residual of the Zubov equation, a first-order partial differential equation whose solution yields a Lyapunov function. The inferred quadratic Lyapunov function can then characterize an ellipsoidal estimate of the stability region. Numerical results on benchmark examples demonstrate that our physics-informed stability analysis method successfully characterizes a near-maximal ellipsoid of the system stability region associated with the inferred Lyapunov function without requiring knowledge of the system governing equations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MARL方法多依赖静态或逐步关系图，忽略了智能体交互随时间演变的动态特性，难以实现鲁棒且自适应的协作。因此，需捕捉交互关系的时序演化以提升协调能力。

Method: TIGER构建动态时序图来连接智能体当前与历史交互，并采用基于时序注意力的编码器聚合结构与时间邻域信息，生成时序感知的智能体嵌入，用于指导协作策略学习。

Conclusion: TIGER通过显式建模多智能体系统中时序交互结构，证明了结合结构与时间因素对提升MARL策略学习效果具有重要意义。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose capturing and utilizing \textit{Temporal Information through Graph-based Embeddings and Representations} or \textbf{TIGER} to enhance multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). We explicitly model how inter-agent coordination structures evolve over time. While most MARL approaches rely on static or per-step relational graphs, they overlook the temporal evolution of interactions that naturally arise as agents adapt, move, or reorganize cooperation strategies. Capturing such evolving dependencies is key to achieving robust and adaptive coordination. To this end, TIGER constructs dynamic temporal graphs of MARL agents, connecting their current and historical interactions. It then employs a temporal attention-based encoder to aggregate information across these structural and temporal neighborhoods, yielding time-aware agent embeddings that guide cooperative policy learning. Through extensive experiments on two coordination-intensive benchmarks, we show that TIGER consistently outperforms diverse value-decomposition and graph-based MARL baselines in task performance and sample efficiency. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to isolate the impact of key design parameters in TIGER, revealing how structural and temporal factors can jointly shape effective policy learning in MARL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的差分隐私随机梯度下降方法DP-PMLF，通过结合逐样本动量和低通滤波策略，同时缓解了差分隐私中的噪声和剪裁偏差问题，提升了模型的隐私-效用权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的差分隐私训练方法通常只能单独应对噪声或剪裁偏差，而无法同时解决两者之间的矛盾，导致模型准确率下降。因此需要一种能同时缓解噪声和偏差的方法。

Method: 提出DP-PMLF方法，利用逐样本动量在剪裁前平滑梯度估计以降低采样方差，并引入后处理的低通滤波器来抑制高频差分隐私噪声，且不消耗额外隐私预算。

Result: 理论分析表明该方法在严格差分隐私下具有更优的收敛速度，实验结果表明其在多个基准上显著优于现有DPSGD变体。

Conclusion: DP-PMLF能有效同时缓解差分隐私训练中的噪声与剪裁偏差，显著改善隐私保护与模型性能之间的权衡。

Abstract: Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DPSGD) is widely used to train deep neural networks with formal privacy guarantees. However, the addition of differential privacy (DP) often degrades model accuracy by introducing both noise and bias. Existing techniques typically address only one of these issues, as reducing DP noise can exacerbate clipping bias and vice-versa. In this paper, we propose a novel method, \emph{DP-PMLF}, which integrates per-sample momentum with a low-pass filtering strategy to simultaneously mitigate DP noise and clipping bias. Our approach uses per-sample momentum to smooth gradient estimates prior to clipping, thereby reducing sampling variance. It further employs a post-processing low-pass filter to attenuate high-frequency DP noise without consuming additional privacy budget. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating an improved convergence rate under rigorous DP guarantees, and our empirical evaluations reveal that DP-PMLF significantly enhances the privacy-utility trade-off compared to several state-of-the-art DPSGD variants.

Abstract: Topological descriptors have been increasingly utilized for capturing multiscale structural information in relational data. In this work, we consider various filtrations on the (box) product of graphs and the effect on their outputs on the topological descriptors - the Euler characteristic (EC) and persistent homology (PH). In particular, we establish a complete characterization of the expressive power of EC on general color-based filtrations. We also show that the PH descriptors of (virtual) graph products contain strictly more information than the computation on individual graphs, whereas EC does not. Additionally, we provide algorithms to compute the PH diagrams of the product of vertex- and edge-level filtrations on the graph product. We also substantiate our theoretical analysis with empirical investigations on runtime analysis, expressivity, and graph classification performance. Overall, this work paves way for powerful graph persistent descriptors via product filtrations. Code is available at https://github.com/Aalto-QuML/tda_graph_product.

TL;DR: 提出两种GNN无关的图超分辨率框架Bi-SR和DEFEND，分别通过双部图和对偶图实现结构感知的节点和边超分辨率，在脑连接组数据上达到SOTA性能，并发布12个新模拟数据集以促进该领域研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图超分辨率方法忽视图结构、缺乏置换不变性，且依赖节点表示推断边权重，限制了可扩展性和表达能力。

Method: Bi-SR构建连接低分辨率与高分辨率节点的双部图，实现结构感知的节点超分辨率；DEFEND将高分辨率边映射为对偶图的节点，利用标准节点GNN进行边预测。

Result: 在真实脑连接组数据上，模型在七个拓扑指标上达到最先进性能；构建了十二个具有多样拓扑和LR-HR关系的模拟数据集用于全面评估。

Conclusion: 所提框架解决了现有方法在结构保持和可扩展性上的缺陷，推动了图超分辨率技术的发展，尤其适用于医疗等资源受限领域。

Abstract: Graph super-resolution, the task of inferring high-resolution (HR) graphs from low-resolution (LR) counterparts, is an underexplored yet crucial research direction that circumvents the need for costly data acquisition. This makes it especially desirable for resource-constrained fields such as the medical domain. While recent GNN-based approaches show promise, they suffer from two key limitations: (1) matrix-based node super-resolution that disregards graph structure and lacks permutation invariance; and (2) reliance on node representations to infer edge weights, which limits scalability and expressivity. In this work, we propose two GNN-agnostic frameworks to address these issues. First, Bi-SR introduces a bipartite graph connecting LR and HR nodes to enable structure-aware node super-resolution that preserves topology and permutation invariance. Second, DEFEND learns edge representations by mapping HR edges to nodes of a dual graph, allowing edge inference via standard node-based GNNs. We evaluate both frameworks on a real-world brain connectome dataset, where they achieve state-of-the-art performance across seven topological measures. To support generalization, we introduce twelve new simulated datasets that capture diverse topologies and LR-HR relationships. These enable comprehensive benchmarking of graph super-resolution methods.

TL;DR: 本文扩展了随机参数分解（SPD）方法至Transformer模型，提出适用于序列数据的因果重要性函数和新损失函数，首次在GPT-2-small中成功定位与‘高尔夫’、‘篮球’等可解释概念对应的子组件，推动SPD向现代模型应用迈出第一步。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将已在玩具模型上验证的参数空间分解方法推广到真实、复杂的现代模型（如Transformer），以实现对实际模型中可解释机制的分析与干预。

Method: 扩展Stochastic Parameter Decomposition (SPD) 到Transformer架构，引入新的因果重要性函数以适应序列数据特性，并设计新的损失函数以提升分解效果。

Result: 在玩具归纳头模型上成功恢复出预期的两步电路；在GPT-2-small中定位到与‘高尔夫’、‘篮球’等语义概念相关的可解释子组件。

Conclusion: SPD方法可被有效扩展至现代Transformer模型，能够揭示参数空间中的可解释机制，为后续在真实模型中进行机械性解释提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Recent work in mechanistic interpretability has shown that decomposing models in parameter space may yield clean handles for analysis and intervention. Previous methods have demonstrated successful applications on a wide range of toy models, but the gap to "real models" has not yet been bridged. In this work, we extend Stochastic Parameter Decomposition (SPD) to Transformer models, proposing an updated causal importance function suited for sequential data and a new loss function. We demonstrate that SPD can successfully decompose a toy induction-head model and recover the expected 2-step circuit. We also show that applying SPD to GPT-2-small can successfully locate subcomponents corresponding to interpretable concepts like "golf" and "basketball". These results take the first step in the direction of extending SPD to modern models, and show that we can use the method to surface interpretable parameter-space mechanisms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的概率性时空预测模型ForeSWE，结合深度学习与高斯过程，用于提升雪水当量（SWE）预测的准确性与不确定性量化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于SWE受地形和环境条件影响，具有显著的时空变异性，传统方法未能充分捕捉其时空相关性且缺乏不确定性估计，限制了其在水资源管理中的应用。

Method: 提出ForeSWE模型，融合注意力机制以捕获时空特征与交互，并结合Gaussian Process模块进行不确定性建模，实现概率性预测。

Result: 在512个SNOTEL站点数据上验证，ForeSWE在预测精度和预测区间质量上均优于现有方法，且能有效提供不确定性估计。

Conclusion: ForeSWE为SWE预测提供了更可靠、可解释的解决方案，具备实际部署潜力，有助于支持复杂水资源管理决策。

Abstract: Various complex water management decisions are made in snow-dominant watersheds with the knowledge of Snow-Water Equivalent (SWE) -- a key measure widely used to estimate the water content of a snowpack. However, forecasting SWE is challenging because SWE is influenced by various factors including topography and an array of environmental conditions, and has therefore been observed to be spatio-temporally variable. Classical approaches to SWE forecasting have not adequately utilized these spatial/temporal correlations, nor do they provide uncertainty estimates -- which can be of significant value to the decision maker. In this paper, we present ForeSWE, a new probabilistic spatio-temporal forecasting model that integrates deep learning and classical probabilistic techniques. The resulting model features a combination of an attention mechanism to integrate spatiotemporal features and interactions, alongside a Gaussian process module that provides principled quantification of prediction uncertainty. We evaluate the model on data from 512 Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations in the Western US. The results show significant improvements in both forecasting accuracy and prediction interval compared to existing approaches. The results also serve to highlight the efficacy in uncertainty estimates between different approaches. Collectively, these findings have provided a platform for deployment and feedback by the water management community.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出EEG-X，一种设备无关且抗噪声的脑电图（EEG）基础模型，通过位置编码通道嵌入、噪声感知掩码重建策略及字典启发的卷积变换层（DiCT），在多设备、低信噪比场景下实现跨域鲁棒表征学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑电图分析的基础模型受限于不同设备和配置导致的数据集差异以及EEG信号本身信噪比低、易受伪迹干扰的问题，亟需一种通用且鲁棒的表示学习方法。

Method: 引入基于位置的通道嵌入以编码空间信息并适应不同通道数和布局；采用在原始和潜在空间中进行噪声感知的掩码与重建策略，训练模型重构去噪后的信号而非原始噪声信号；设计字典启发的卷积变换（DiCT）层，将信号映射到结构化特征空间以降低对噪声的敏感性，并捕捉频率与形态相似性。

Result: 在来自多种设备的数据集上实验表明，EEG-X在多个下游任务中优于现有最先进方法，尤其在预训练与下游数据电极布局不同的跨域设置下表现突出。

Conclusion: EEG-X是一种有效的设备无关、抗噪声EEG基础模型，通过创新的空间编码、去噪感知重建和结构化特征学习机制，显著提升了EEG信号在复杂真实场景下的表征能力与泛化性能。

Abstract: Foundation models for EEG analysis are still in their infancy, limited by two key challenges: (1) variability across datasets caused by differences in recording devices and configurations, and (2) the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of EEG, where brain signals are often buried under artifacts and non-brain sources. To address these challenges, we present EEG-X, a device-agnostic and noise-robust foundation model for EEG representation learning. EEG-X introduces a novel location-based channel embedding that encodes spatial information and improves generalization across domains and tasks by allowing the model to handle varying channel numbers, combinations, and recording lengths. To enhance robustness against noise, EEG-X employs a noise-aware masking and reconstruction strategy in both raw and latent spaces. Unlike previous models that mask and reconstruct raw noisy EEG signals, EEG-X is trained to reconstruct denoised signals obtained through an artifact removal process, ensuring that the learned representations focus on neural activity rather than noise. To further enhance reconstruction-based pretraining, EEG-X introduces a dictionary-inspired convolutional transformation (DiCT) layer that projects signals into a structured feature space before computing reconstruction (MSE) loss, reducing noise sensitivity and capturing frequency- and shape-aware similarities. Experiments on datasets collected from diverse devices show that EEG-X outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple downstream EEG tasks and excels in cross-domain settings where pre-trained and downstream datasets differ in electrode layouts.

TL;DR: 提出一种结合Transformer和1D CNN的两阶段模型，通过融合临床元数据和专家事件标注等上下文信息，显著提升自动睡眠分期性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型多依赖原始PSG信号，忽略人类专家使用的上下文线索，导致自动化睡眠分期准确性受限。

Method: 采用两阶段架构：基于Transformer的单 epoch 编码器和1D CNN聚合器，并融合受试者临床元数据（年龄、性别、BMI）及每 epoch 的专家事件标注（如呼吸暂停、去饱和等）进行上下文建模。

Result: 在SHHS数据集（n=8,357）上，相比仅使用PSG信号的基线模型（macro-F1 0.7745, micro-F1 0.8774），所提模型将macro-F1提升至0.8031，micro-F1提升至0.9051，其中事件注释贡献最大；特征融合优于多任务学习方法。

Conclusion: 融合临床有意义的上下文特征可有效提升睡眠分期模型的性能与可解释性，无需更改PSG导联或增加传感器，为实现贴近专家判读的自动化睡眠分期提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Manual sleep staging from polysomnography (PSG) is labor-intensive and prone to inter-scorer variability. While recent deep learning models have advanced automated staging, most rely solely on raw PSG signals and neglect contextual cues used by human experts. We propose a two-stage architecture that combines a Transformer-based per-epoch encoder with a 1D CNN aggregator, and systematically investigates the effect of incorporating explicit context: subject-level clinical metadata (age, sex, BMI) and per-epoch expert event annotations (apneas, desaturations, arousals, periodic breathing). Using the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) cohort (n=8,357), we demonstrate that contextual fusion substantially improves staging accuracy. Compared to a PSG-only baseline (macro-F1 0.7745, micro-F1 0.8774), our final model achieves macro-F1 0.8031 and micro-F1 0.9051, with event annotations contributing the largest gains. Notably, feature fusion outperforms multi-task alternatives that predict the same auxiliary labels. These results highlight that augmenting learned representations with clinically meaningful features enhances both performance and interpretability, without modifying the PSG montage or requiring additional sensors. Our findings support a practical and scalable path toward context-aware, expert-aligned sleep staging systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的深度网络Covariance Scattering Transforms (CSTs)，通过在协方差谱上应用局部滤波器生成表达性强且稳定的分层表示，在小样本情况下优于或媲美PCA和复杂模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PCA在低方差方向信息丢失且在小样本下不稳定，而现有基于协方差的神经网络需要标签和训练；因此需要一种无需训练、稳定且能捕捉协方差谱中精细模式的方法。

Method: 设计CSTs，使用协方差小波作为滤波器，在协方差图上逐层提取非线性、多尺度特征，并引入剪枝机制提升计算与内存效率。

Result: 理论证明CSTs对协方差估计误差更鲁棒，尤其在特征值接近时稳定性优于PCA；实验显示其在4个神经退行性疾病数据集上的年龄预测任务中表现稳定且准确。

Conclusion: CSTs结合了PCA的无监督特性与VNNs的表达力和稳定性，是一种高效、无需训练的协方差特征提取方法，适用于小样本和高噪声场景。

Abstract: Machine learning and data processing techniques relying on covariance information are widespread as they identify meaningful patterns in unsupervised and unlabeled settings. As a prominent example, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) projects data points onto the eigenvectors of their covariance matrix, capturing the directions of maximum variance. This mapping, however, falls short in two directions: it fails to capture information in low-variance directions, relevant when, e.g., the data contains high-variance noise; and it provides unstable results in low-sample regimes, especially when covariance eigenvalues are close. CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs), i.e., graph neural networks using the covariance matrix as a graph, show improved stability to estimation errors and learn more expressive functions in the covariance spectrum than PCA, but require training and operate in a labeled setup. To get the benefits of both worlds, we propose Covariance Scattering Transforms (CSTs), deep untrained networks that sequentially apply filters localized in the covariance spectrum to the input data and produce expressive hierarchical representations via nonlinearities. We define the filters as covariance wavelets that capture specific and detailed covariance spectral patterns. We improve CSTs' computational and memory efficiency via a pruning mechanism, and we prove that their error due to finite-sample covariance estimations is less sensitive to close covariance eigenvalues compared to PCA, improving their stability. Our experiments on age prediction from cortical thickness measurements on 4 datasets collecting patients with neurodegenerative diseases show that CSTs produce stable representations in low-data settings, as VNNs but without any training, and lead to comparable or better predictions w.r.t. more complex learning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在时间序列预测中，全面验证多个模型计算成本高，而选错模型会导致性能不佳，因此需要一种高效的模型选择方法。

Method: 引入谱可预测性Ω作为信号处理指标，通过在四个领域进行控制实验，并结合GIFT-Eval基准中的51个模型和28个数据集进行分析，评估Ω对模型家族性能的分层能力。

Result: 发现当Ω值高时，大型时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）显著优于轻量级模型；而当Ω降低时，其优势消失。计算Ω仅需几秒钟，可快速判断数据是否适合TSFM。

Conclusion: Ω能有效作为模型选择的初步筛选工具，降低验证成本，并指出当前模型在低Ω（难预测）问题上的不足，提示未来应关注此类难题的建模。

Abstract: Practitioners deploying time series forecasting models face a dilemma: exhaustively validating dozens of models is computationally prohibitive, yet choosing the wrong model risks poor performance. We show that spectral predictability~$Ω$ -- a simple signal processing metric -- systematically stratifies model family performance, enabling fast model selection. We conduct controlled experiments in four different domains, then further expand our analysis to 51 models and 28 datasets from the GIFT-Eval benchmark. We find that large time series foundation models (TSFMs) systematically outperform lightweight task-trained baselines when $Ω$ is high, while their advantage vanishes as $Ω$ drops. Computing $Ω$ takes seconds per dataset, enabling practitioners to quickly assess whether their data suits TSFM approaches or whether simpler, cheaper models suffice. We demonstrate that $Ω$ stratifies model performance predictably, offering a practical first-pass filter that reduces validation costs while highlighting the need for models that excel on genuinely difficult (low-$Ω$) problems rather than merely optimizing easy ones.

Abstract: Stroke is an acute cerebrovascular disease, and timely diagnosis significantly improves patient survival. However, existing automated diagnosis methods suffer from fairness issues across demographic groups, potentially exacerbating healthcare disparities. In this work we propose FAST-CAD, a theoretically grounded framework that combines domain-adversarial training (DAT) with group distributionally robust optimization (Group-DRO) for fair and accurate non-contact stroke diagnosis. Our approach is built on domain adaptation and minimax fairness theory and provides convergence guarantees and fairness bounds. We curate a multimodal dataset covering 12 demographic subgroups defined by age, gender, and posture. FAST-CAD employs self-supervised encoders with adversarial domain discrimination to learn demographic-invariant representations, while Group-DRO optimizes worst-group risk to ensure robust performance across all subgroups. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior diagnostic performance while maintaining fairness across demographic groups, and our theoretical analysis supports the effectiveness of the unified DAT + Group-DRO framework. This work provides both practical advances and theoretical insights for fair medical AI systems.

Result: 在PEMS-BAY和METR-LA数据集上，Weaver在训练效率更高的同时达到了与其他模型相当的预测性能。

Conclusion: Weaver通过结构创新实现了高效、精确的交通流预测，兼具低计算复杂度和良好的实际建模能力。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal forecasting on transportation networks is a complex task that requires understanding how traffic nodes interact within a dynamic, evolving system dictated by traffic flow dynamics and social behavioral patterns. The importance of transportation networks and ITS for modern mobility and commerce necessitates forecasting models that are not only accurate but also interpretable, efficient, and robust under structural or temporal perturbations. Recent approaches, particularly Transformer-based architectures, have improved predictive performance but often at the cost of high computational overhead and diminished architectural interpretability. In this work, we introduce Weaver, a novel attention-based model that applies Kronecker product approximations (KPA) to decompose the PN X PN spatiotemporal attention of O(P^2N^2) complexity into local P X P temporal and N X N spatial attention maps. This Kronecker attention map enables our Parallel-Kronecker Matrix-Vector product (P2-KMV) for efficient spatiotemporal message passing with O(P^2N + N^2P) complexity. To capture real-world traffic dynamics, we address the importance of negative edges in modeling traffic behavior by introducing Valence Attention using the continuous Tanimoto coefficient (CTC), which provides properties conducive to precise latent graph generation and training stability. To fully utilize the model's learning capacity, we introduce the Traffic Phase Dictionary for self-conditioning. Evaluations on PEMS-BAY and METR-LA show that Weaver achieves competitive performance across model categories while training more efficiently.

Conclusion: DIVO有效平衡了保守性与探索性，提升了扩散模型在离线强化学习中的表达能力与效率。

Abstract: In offline reinforcement learning, value overestimation caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions significantly limits policy performance. Recently, diffusion models have been leveraged for their strong distribution-matching capabilities, enforcing conservatism through behavior policy constraints. However, existing methods often apply indiscriminate regularization to redundant actions in low-quality datasets, resulting in excessive conservatism and an imbalance between the expressiveness and efficiency of diffusion modeling. To address these issues, we propose DIffusion policies with Value-conditional Optimization (DIVO), a novel approach that leverages diffusion models to generate high-quality, broadly covered in-distribution state-action samples while facilitating efficient policy improvement. Specifically, DIVO introduces a binary-weighted mechanism that utilizes the advantage values of actions in the offline dataset to guide diffusion model training. This enables a more precise alignment with the dataset's distribution while selectively expanding the boundaries of high-advantage actions. During policy improvement, DIVO dynamically filters high-return-potential actions from the diffusion model, effectively guiding the learned policy toward better performance. This approach achieves a critical balance between conservatism and explorability in offline RL. We evaluate DIVO on the D4RL benchmark and compare it against state-of-the-art baselines. Empirical results demonstrate that DIVO achieves superior performance, delivering significant improvements in average returns across locomotion tasks and outperforming existing methods in the challenging AntMaze domain, where sparse rewards pose a major difficulty.

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) for neural networks on tabular data is critical to a wide range of applications, yet it remains challenging due to large, non-convex search spaces and the cost of exhaustive tuning. We introduce the Quantum-Inspired Bilevel Optimizer for Neural Networks (QIBONN), a bilevel framework that encodes feature selection, architectural hyperparameters, and regularization in a unified qubit-based representation. By combining deterministic quantum-inspired rotations with stochastic qubit mutations guided by a global attractor, QIBONN balances exploration and exploitation under a fixed evaluation budget. We conduct systematic experiments under single-qubit bit-flip noise (0.1\%--1\%) emulated by an IBM-Q backend. Results on 13 real-world datasets indicate that QIBONN is competitive with established methods, including classical tree-based methods and both classical/quantum-inspired HPO algorithms under the same tuning budget.

Conclusion: 所提方法通过精确重建TAC显著提升了后门检测与清除的准确性，优于现有防御技术。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a critical threat to machine learning models, causing them to behave normally on clean data but misclassify poisoned data into a poisoned class. Existing defenses often attempt to identify and remove backdoor neurons based on Trigger-Activated Changes (TAC) which is the activation differences between clean and poisoned data. These methods suffer from low precision in identifying true backdoor neurons due to inaccurate estimation of TAC values. In this work, we propose a novel backdoor removal method by accurately reconstructing TAC values in the latent representation. Specifically, we formulate the minimal perturbation that forces clean data to be classified into a specific class as a convex quadratic optimization problem, whose optimal solution serves as a surrogate for TAC. We then identify the poisoned class by detecting statistically small $L^2$ norms of perturbations and leverage the perturbation of the poisoned class in fine-tuning to remove backdoors. Experiments on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and TinyImageNet demonstrated that our approach consistently achieves superior backdoor suppression with high clean accuracy across different attack types, datasets, and architectures, outperforming existing defense methods.

TL;DR: 本文探索了使用条件变分自编码器（CVAE）进行图像生成，通过将高斯解码器的方差作为可学习参数，并利用标准化流估计潜在空间的条件分布，显著提升了生成图像的质量和似然度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于扩散模型已成为生成模型的主流，传统模型如VAE和GAN的研究进展停滞。本文旨在重新探索并改进条件变分自编码器（CVAE），以提升其在图像生成中的表现。

Method: 采用条件变分自编码器（CVAE），将高斯解码器的方差设为可学习参数，并使用标准化流来估计潜在空间的条件分布，从而改善生成效果。

Result: 相比之前的方法，FID降低了5%，对数似然提高了7.7%。

Conclusion: 通过引入可学习的方差参数和标准化流估计条件分布，CVAE在图像生成质量上取得了显著提升，证明了传统生成模型仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks remained the state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models until 2022. Now they are superseded by diffusion based models. Efforts to improve traditional models have stagnated as a result. In old-school fashion, we explore image generation with conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAE) to incorporate desired attributes within the images. VAEs are known to produce blurry images with less diversity, we refer a method that solve this issue by leveraging the variance of the gaussian decoder as a learnable parameter during training. Previous works on CVAEs assumed that the conditional distribution of the latent space given the labels is equal to the prior distribution, which is not the case in reality. We show that estimating it using normalizing flows results in better image generation than existing methods by reducing the FID by 5% and increasing log likelihood by 7.7% than the previous case.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Mixture-of-Experts架构的贝叶斯后验不确定性估计方法Bayesian-MoE，用于细调的大语言模型，无需修改训练过程或增加参数，通过结构化Laplace近似实现可校准的不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在不改变现有MoE模型训练流程的前提下，提供可靠的后验不确定性估计，提升大语言模型在下游任务中的决策可靠性。

Method: 对MoE模型中每个专家的第二线性层应用结构化Laplace近似，并采用Kronecker分解的低秩近似来建模曲率，实现模块化的后验估计和可扩展的不确定性预测。

Result: 在Qwen1.5-MoE和DeepSeek-MoE上实验表明，该方法相比基线显著降低了期望校准误差（ECE）和负对数似然（NLL），提升了不确定性估计的校准性。

Conclusion: Bayesian-MoE有效利用了MoE模型的模块化结构，在不引入额外参数的情况下实现了高效的后验不确定性估计，适用于需要可靠置信度输出的实际应用场景。

Abstract: We present Bayesian Mixture of Experts (Bayesian-MoE), a post-hoc uncertainty estimation framework for fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) based on Mixture-of-Experts architectures. Our method applies a structured Laplace approximation to the second linear layer of each expert, enabling calibrated uncertainty estimation without modifying the original training procedure or introducing new parameters. Unlike prior approaches, which apply Bayesian inference to added adapter modules, Bayesian-MoE directly targets the expert pathways already present in MoE models, leveraging their modular design for tractable block-wise posterior estimation. We use Kronecker-factored low-rank approximations to model curvature and derive scalable estimates of predictive uncertainty and marginal likelihood. Experiments on common-sense reasoning benchmarks with Qwen1.5-MoE and DeepSeek-MoE demonstrate that Bayesian-MoE improves both expected calibration error (ECE) and negative log-likelihood (NLL) over baselines, confirming its effectiveness for reliable downstream decision-making.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于最优传输的稀疏混合专家（SMoE）路由机制——Selective Sinkhorn Routing（SSR），通过引入轻量级Sinkhorn算法解决专家负载均衡问题，无需依赖辅助损失或额外参数，提升了模型效率与性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SMoE模型依赖辅助损失和可训练参数来实现专家平衡，导致目标不一致和复杂度增加；基于Sinkhorn的方法则训练开销大。本文旨在设计一种高效、低复杂度且无需辅助损失的路由机制。

Method: 将token到专家的分配建模为带约束的最优传输问题，利用Sinkhorn算法求解，并从中直接导出门控分数。提出Selective Sinkhorn Routing（SSR），仅在必要时应用Sinkhorn优化以减少计算开销。

Result: SSR在语言建模和图像分类任务上实现了更快的训练速度、更高的准确率以及更强的对输入噪声的鲁棒性，同时避免了辅助损失的使用。

Conclusion: SSR提供了一种更简洁、高效的SMoE路由方案，通过最优传输理论实现了更好的负载均衡与模型性能，具备理论支持与实证优势。

Abstract: Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) has gained prominence as a scalable and computationally efficient architecture, enabling significant growth in model capacity without incurring additional inference costs. However, existing SMoE models often rely on auxiliary losses (e.g., z-loss, load balancing) and additional trainable parameters (e.g., noisy gating) to encourage expert diversity, leading to objective misalignment and increased model complexity. Moreover, existing Sinkhorn-based methods suffer from significant training overhead due to their heavy reliance on the computationally expensive Sinkhorn algorithm. In this work, we formulate token-to-expert assignment as an optimal transport problem, incorporating constraints to ensure balanced expert utilization. We demonstrate that introducing a minimal degree of optimal transport-based routing enhances SMoE performance without requiring auxiliary balancing losses. Unlike previous methods, our approach derives gating scores directly from the transport map, enabling more effective token-to-expert balancing, supported by both theoretical analysis and empirical results. Building on these insights, we propose Selective Sinkhorn Routing (SSR), a routing mechanism that replaces auxiliary loss with lightweight Sinkhorn-based routing. SSR promotes balanced token assignments while preserving flexibility in expert selection. Across both language modeling and image classification tasks, SSR achieves faster training, higher accuracy, and greater robustness to input corruption.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机对照试验（RCTs）虽是验证医学AI工具临床价值的金标准，但其高昂成本和漫长周期难以跟上AI模型快速迭代的步伐，亟需更高效的验证方法。

Method: 提出BRIDGE设计，利用先前完成试验中参与者层面的数据，在新旧AI模型预测一致时进行数据复用，减少后续试验所需入组人数；并通过真实世界数据评估模型间预测的一致性，结合模拟验证该设计在保持统计功效的同时降低样本量。

Result: 在乳腺癌、心血管疾病和脓毒症的真实数据集中，连续AI模型在高风险人群中的预测一致性最高达64.8%；乳腺癌筛查研究的模拟显示，BRIDGE设计可减少46.6%的入组需求，节省超280万美元，同时保持80%的统计功效。

Conclusion: BRIDGE设计通过数据复用将传统试验转变为自适应、模块化的研究模式，使每次AI模型更新都能高效获得一级证据，推动AI在临床中的快速、经济转化。

Abstract: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are indispensable for establishing the clinical value of medical artificial-intelligence (AI) tools, yet their high cost and long timelines hinder timely validation as new models emerge rapidly. Here, we propose BRIDGE, a data-reuse RCT design for AI-based risk models. AI risk models support a broad range of interventions, including screening, treatment selection, and clinical alerts. BRIDGE trials recycle participant-level data from completed trials of AI models when legacy and updated models make concordant predictions, thereby reducing the enrollment requirement for subsequent trials. We provide a practical checklist for investigators to assess whether reusing data from previous trials allows for valid causal inference and preserves type I error. Using real-world datasets across breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and sepsis, we demonstrate concordance between successive AI models, with up to 64.8% overlap in top 5% high-risk cohorts. We then simulate a series of breast cancer screening studies, where our design reduced required enrollment by 46.6%--saving over US$2.8 million--while maintaining 80% power. By transforming trials into adaptive, modular studies, our proposed design makes Level I evidence generation feasible for every model iteration, thereby accelerating cost-effective translation of AI into routine care.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了非欧流形数据聚类的效率与鲁棒性，适用于复杂流形结构的数据分析。

Abstract: We introduce a novel, efficient framework for clustering data on high-dimensional, non-Euclidean manifolds that overcomes the computational challenges associated with standard intrinsic methods. The key innovation is the use of the $p$-Fréchet map $F^p : \mathcal{M} \to \mathbb{R}^\ell$ -- defined on a generic metric space $\mathcal{M}$ -- which embeds the manifold data into a lower-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^\ell$ using a set of reference points $\{r_i\}_{i=1}^\ell$, $r_i \in \mathcal{M}$. Once embedded, we can efficiently and accurately apply standard Euclidean clustering techniques such as k-means. We rigorously analyze the mathematical properties of $F^p$ in the Euclidean space and the challenging manifold of $n \times n$ symmetric positive definite matrices $\mathit{SPD}(n)$. Extensive numerical experiments using synthetic and real $\mathit{SPD}(n)$ data demonstrate significant performance gains: our method reduces runtime by up to two orders of magnitude compared to intrinsic manifold-based approaches, all while maintaining high clustering accuracy, including scenarios where existing alternative methods struggle or fail.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have impressive data fusion and reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving (AD). However, training LLMs for AD faces significant challenges including high computation transmission costs, and privacy concerns associated with sensitive driving data. Federated Learning (FL) is promising for enabling autonomous vehicles (AVs) to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data. We present Federated LLM-based Autonomous Driving (FLAD), an FL framework that leverages distributed multimodal sensory data across AVs in heterogeneous environment. FLAD has three key innovations: (1) a cloud-edge-vehicle collaborative architecture that reduces communication delay and preserving data privacy; (2) an intelligent parallelized collaborative training with a communication scheduling mechanism that optimizes training efficiency, leveraging end-devices otherwise having insufficient resources for model training; and (3) a knowledge distillation method that personalizes LLM according to heterogeneous edge data. In addition, we prototype FLAD in a testbed with NVIDIA Jetsons, overcoming practical implementation challenges including CPU/GPU memory sharing in resource-constrained devices, dynamic model partitions, and fault-tolerant training.Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that FLAD achieves superior end-to-end AD performance while efficiently utilizing distributed vehicular resources, opening up new possibilities for future collaborative AD model training and knowledge sharing.

Motivation: 现有联邦学习方法在处理数据分布差异（如协变量偏移和语义偏移）时存在局限，难以准确捕捉不变特征并构建因果表示，影响了实际部署的可靠性。

Method: 提出FedSDWC，利用因果推断建模不变特征与可变特征之间的弱因果关系，推断出因果语义表示，从而克服传统不变学习方法的不足。

Result: 理论分析推导了FedSDWC的泛化误差界，并首次建立了其与客户端先验分布的关系；实验表明该方法在多个基准数据集上优于现有方法，在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上分别平均超越次优方法FedICON 3.04%和8.11%。

Conclusion: FedSDWC有效提升了联邦学习在异构数据环境下的鲁棒性和泛化能力，为解决现实场景中的分布偏移问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Amid growing demands for data privacy and advances in computational infrastructure, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a prominent distributed learning paradigm. Nevertheless, differences in data distribution (such as covariate and semantic shifts) severely affect its reliability in real-world deployments. To address this issue, we propose FedSDWC, a causal inference method that integrates both invariant and variant features. FedSDWC infers causal semantic representations by modeling the weak causal influence between invariant and variant features, effectively overcoming the limitations of existing invariant learning methods in accurately capturing invariant features and directly constructing causal representations. This approach significantly enhances FL's ability to generalize and detect OOD data. Theoretically, we derive FedSDWC's generalization error bound under specific conditions and, for the first time, establish its relationship with client prior distributions. Moreover, extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets validate the superior performance of FedSDWC in handling covariate and semantic shifts. For example, FedSDWC outperforms FedICON, the next best baseline, by an average of 3.04% on CIFAR-10 and 8.11% on CIFAR-100.

Motivation: 现代预训练语言模型的表示空间具有高度非线性和几何结构，传统的线性邻域聚合会在语义流形上引起几何失真和语义漂移，损害表示质量。因此需要一种能够保持语义流形结构的聚合机制。

Method: 提出基于局部PCA的语义漂移度量方法，设计Geodesic Aggregation机制，利用指数映射和对数映射在单位球面上沿测地线进行非线性聚合，并结合球面注意力与流形插值构建GeoGNN模型。

Conclusion: 文本属性图中的语义表示位于弯曲的流形上，应采用流形感知的聚合方式以保持语义一致性；Geodesic Aggregation和GeoGNN为GNN在非欧表示空间中的设计提供了新的范式。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) on text--attributed graphs (TAGs) typically encode node texts using pretrained language models (PLMs) and propagate these embeddings through linear neighborhood aggregation. However, the representation spaces of modern PLMs are highly non--linear and geometrically structured, where textual embeddings reside on curved semantic manifolds rather than flat Euclidean spaces. Linear aggregation on such manifolds inevitably distorts geometry and causes semantic drift--a phenomenon where aggregated representations deviate from the intrinsic manifold, losing semantic fidelity and expressive power. To quantitatively investigate this problem, this work introduces a local PCA--based metric that measures the degree of semantic drift and provides the first quantitative framework to analyze how different aggregation mechanisms affect manifold structure. Building upon these insights, we propose Geodesic Aggregation, a manifold--aware mechanism that aggregates neighbor information along geodesics via log--exp mappings on the unit sphere, ensuring that representations remain faithful to the semantic manifold during message passing. We further develop GeoGNN, a practical instantiation that integrates spherical attention with manifold interpolation. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets and multiple text encoders show that GeoGNN substantially mitigates semantic drift and consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing the importance of manifold--aware aggregation in text--attributed graph learning.

Abstract: Interactive preference elicitation (IPE) aims to substantially reduce human effort while acquiring human preferences in wide personalization systems. Dueling bandit (DB) algorithms enable optimal decision-making in IPE building on pairwise comparisons. However, they remain inefficient when human feedback is sparse. Existing methods address sparsity by heavily relying on parametric reward models, whose rigid assumptions are vulnerable to misspecification. In contrast, we explore an alternative perspective based on feedback augmentation, and introduce critical improvements to the model-free DB framework. Specifically, we introduce augmented confidence bounds to integrate augmented human feedback under generalized concentration properties, and analyze the multi-factored performance trade-off via regret analysis. Our prototype algorithm achieves competitive performance across several IPE benchmarks, including recommendation, multi-objective optimization, and response optimization for large language models, demonstrating the potential of our approach for provably efficient IPE in broader applications.

TL;DR: 提出一种新的投影方法（PINN-Proj），在物理信息神经网络（PINNs）中保证线性和二次积分量的守恒，显著减少守恒误差（三到四个数量级），并略微降低PDE解的误差，同时改善损失景观的条件以促进收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs使用软约束引入灵活性，但也可能导致解违反物理守恒定律，因此需要一种能严格保持积分守恒的方法。

Method: 通过求解带约束的非线性优化问题，推导出可同时或分别保持线性和二次积分守恒的投影公式，并将其应用于PINN训练过程中。

Result: PINN-Proj相比传统软约束方法，将积分守恒误差降低了三到四个数量级，略微减少了PDE解的误差，并显示出通过改善损失景观条件来提升收敛性的证据。

Conclusion: 该投影方法为在PINNs中保证任意积分量的守恒提供了一个通用且有效的框架，前提是存在可解的投影形式。

Abstract: We propose a novel projection method that guarantees the conservation of integral quantities in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). While the soft constraint that PINNs use to enforce the structure of partial differential equations (PDEs) enables necessary flexibility during training, it also permits the discovered solution to violate physical laws. To address this, we introduce a projection method that guarantees the conservation of the linear and quadratic integrals, both separately and jointly. We derived the projection formulae by solving constrained non-linear optimization problems and found that our PINN modified with the projection, which we call PINN-Proj, reduced the error in the conservation of these quantities by three to four orders of magnitude compared to the soft constraint and marginally reduced the PDE solution error. We also found evidence that the projection improved convergence through improving the conditioning of the loss landscape. Our method holds promise as a general framework to guarantee the conservation of any integral quantity in a PINN if a tractable solution exists.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分类属性距离度量通常假设类别间具有固定的拓扑关系，难以适应不同的聚类结构，导致聚类效果不佳。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法通过可学习的类别关系显著提高了聚类准确性，且适用于包含数值和分类属性的混合数据集。

Abstract: Categorical attributes with qualitative values are ubiquitous in cluster analysis of real datasets. Unlike the Euclidean distance of numerical attributes, the categorical attributes lack well-defined relationships of their possible values (also called categories interchangeably), which hampers the exploration of compact categorical data clusters. Although most attempts are made for developing appropriate distance metrics, they typically assume a fixed topological relationship between categories when learning distance metrics, which limits their adaptability to varying cluster structures and often leads to suboptimal clustering performance. This paper, therefore, breaks the intrinsic relationship tie of attribute categories and learns customized distance metrics suitable for flexibly and accurately revealing various cluster distributions. As a result, the fitting ability of the clustering algorithm is significantly enhanced, benefiting from the learnable category relationships. Moreover, the learned category relationships are proved to be Euclidean distance metric-compatible, enabling a seamless extension to mixed datasets that include both numerical and categorical attributes. Comparative experiments on 12 real benchmark datasets with significance tests show the superior clustering accuracy of the proposed method with an average ranking of 1.25, which is significantly higher than the 5.21 ranking of the current best-performing method.

Motivation: VLM生成的标签存在质量低和缺乏错误纠正机制的问题，影响数据标注的可靠性。

Result: 实验表明该方法在分类性能上优于现有方法，且对标签噪声具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: HCL有效提升了弱监督场景下的标注质量和模型性能，兼顾效率与准确性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), with their powerful content generation capabilities, have been successfully applied to data annotation processes. However, the VLM-generated labels exhibit dual limitations: low quality (i.e., label noise) and absence of error correction mechanisms. To enhance label quality, we propose Human-Corrected Labels (HCLs), a novel setting that efficient human correction for VLM-generated noisy labels. As shown in Figure 1(b), HCL strategically deploys human correction only for instances with VLM discrepancies, achieving both higher-quality annotations and reduced labor costs. Specifically, we theoretically derive a risk-consistent estimator that incorporates both human-corrected labels and VLM predictions to train classifiers. Besides, we further propose a conditional probability method to estimate the label distribution using a combination of VLM outputs and model predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior classification performance and is robust to label noise, validating the effectiveness of HCL in practical weak supervision scenarios.

Motivation: 减少大型稀疏矩阵LU分解过程中的填充元素，从而降低内存使用和计算时间，但寻找最优重排序是NP难问题，现有代理目标缺乏理论保证。

Method: 设计基于图编码器的重排序网络，预测行列节点得分，并通过两种重参数化技术生成置换矩阵；将因式分解过程引入目标函数，利用交替方向乘子法和近端梯度下降进行优化。

Result: 在SuiteSparse基准数据集上，相比最先进基线方法，填充数量减少了20%，LU分解时间减少了17.8%。

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效逼近最优重排序，显著减少填充元素和计算时间，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Fill-ins are new nonzero elements in the summation of the upper and lower triangular factors generated during LU factorization. For large sparse matrices, they will increase the memory usage and computational time, and be reduced through proper row or column arrangement, namely matrix reordering. Finding a row or column permutation with the minimal fill-ins is NP-hard, and surrogate objectives are designed to derive fill-in reduction permutations or learn a reordering function. However, there is no theoretical guarantee between the golden criterion and these surrogate objectives. Here we propose to learn a reordering network by minimizing \(l_1\) norm of triangular factors of the reordered matrix to approximate the exact number of fill-ins. The reordering network utilizes a graph encoder to predict row or column node scores. For inference, it is easy and fast to derive the permutation from sorting algorithms for matrices. For gradient based optimization, there is a large gap between the predicted node scores and resultant triangular factors in the optimization objective. To bridge the gap, we first design two reparameterization techniques to obtain the permutation matrix from node scores. The matrix is reordered by multiplying the permutation matrix. Then we introduce the factorization process into the objective function to arrive at target triangular factors. The overall objective function is optimized with the alternating direction method of multipliers and proximal gradient descent. Experimental results on benchmark sparse matrix collection SuiteSparse show the fill-in number and LU factorization time reduction of our proposed method is 20% and 17.8% compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的联邦学习方法FedPM，利用二阶优化并通过服务器端的预条件混合来缓解局部预条件子的漂移问题，理论分析和实验结果表明其在收敛速度和测试精度上优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习中的二阶优化方法因局部预条件子漂移导致收敛困难，尤其在数据异构场景下表现更差，因此需要一种能有效缓解该问题的新方法。

Method: 通过将理想的二阶更新分解为服务器端的参数混合和客户端的局部更新，引入服务器端的预条件混合机制，在保持二阶优化优势的同时减少局部预条件子的漂移。

Result: 理论证明FedPM在强凸目标下单步局部更新即可实现超线性收敛速率；实验结果显示其显著提升测试精度，优于采用简单混合的传统方法。

Conclusion: FedPM有效解决了联邦学习中二阶优化的预条件子漂移问题，兼具理论保证和实际性能提升，是异构数据环境下更优的联邦学习框架。

Abstract: We propose Federated Preconditioned Mixing (FedPM), a novel Federated Learning (FL) method that leverages second-order optimization. Prior methods--such as LocalNewton, LTDA, and FedSophia--have incorporated second-order optimization in FL by performing iterative local updates on clients and applying simple mixing of local parameters on the server. However, these methods often suffer from drift in local preconditioners, which significantly disrupts the convergence of parameter training, particularly in heterogeneous data settings. To overcome this issue, we refine the update rules by decomposing the ideal second-order update--computed using globally preconditioned global gradients--into parameter mixing on the server and local parameter updates on clients. As a result, our FedPM introduces preconditioned mixing of local parameters on the server, effectively mitigating drift in local preconditioners.
  We provide a theoretical convergence analysis demonstrating a superlinear rate for strongly convex objectives in scenarios involving a single local update. To demonstrate the practical benefits of FedPM, we conducted extensive experiments. The results showed significant improvements with FedPM in the test accuracy compared to conventional methods incorporating simple mixing, fully leveraging the potential of second-order optimization.

Motivation: 理解大语言模型在现实系统中部署时的安全漏洞，尤其是RLHF/DPO对齐阶段的数据投毒攻击的理论基础尚不清晰。

Method: 将最小成本投毒攻击建模为带有线性约束的凸优化问题，推导出最小攻击成本的上下界，并提出一种后处理方法来减少标签翻转次数。

Conclusion: 揭示了RLHF/DPO流程中的根本性脆弱性，提供了评估其对低代价投毒攻击鲁棒性的理论工具和实用方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world systems, making it critical to understand their vulnerabilities. While data poisoning attacks during RLHF/DPO alignment have been studied empirically, their theoretical foundations remain unclear. We investigate the minimum-cost poisoning attack required to steer an LLM's policy toward an attacker's target by flipping preference labels during RLHF/DPO, without altering the compared outputs. We formulate this as a convex optimization problem with linear constraints, deriving lower and upper bounds on the minimum attack cost. As a byproduct of this theoretical analysis, we show that any existing label-flipping attack can be post-processed via our proposed method to reduce the number of label flips required while preserving the intended poisoning effect. Empirical results demonstrate that this cost-minimization post-processing can significantly reduce poisoning costs over baselines, particularly when the reward model's feature dimension is small relative to the dataset size. These findings highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in RLHF/DPO pipelines and provide tools to evaluate their robustness against low-cost poisoning attacks.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning for autonomous cyber defence have resulted in agents that can successfully defend simulated computer networks against cyber-attacks. However, many of these agents would need retraining to defend networks with differing topology or size, making them poorly suited to real-world networks where topology and size can vary over time. In this research we introduce a novel set of Topological Extensions for Reinforcement Learning Agents (TERLA) that provide generalisability for the defence of networks with differing topology and size, without the need for retraining. Our approach involves the use of heterogeneous graph neural network layers to produce a fixed-size latent embedding representing the observed network state. This representation learning stage is coupled with a reduced, fixed-size, semantically meaningful and interpretable action space. We apply TERLA to a standard deep reinforcement learning Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) agent model, and to reduce the sim-to-real gap, conduct our research using Cyber Autonomy Gym for Experimentation (CAGE) Challenge 4. This Cyber Operations Research Gym environment has many of the features of a real-world network, such as realistic Intrusion Detection System (IDS) events and multiple agents defending network segments of differing topology and size. TERLA agents retain the defensive performance of vanilla PPO agents whilst showing improved action efficiency. Generalisability has been demonstrated by showing that all TERLA agents have the same network-agnostic neural network architecture, and by deploying a single TERLA agent multiple times to defend network segments with differing topology and size, showing improved defensive performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Class imbalance has been extensively studied in single-view scenarios; however, addressing this challenge in multi-view contexts remains an open problem, with even scarcer research focusing on trustworthy solutions. In this paper, we tackle a particularly challenging class imbalance problem in multi-view scenarios: long-tailed classification. We propose TMLC, a Trusted Multi-view Long-tailed Classification framework, which makes contributions on two critical aspects: opinion aggregation and pseudo-data generation. Specifically, inspired by Social Identity Theory, we design a group consensus opinion aggregation mechanism that guides decision making toward the direction favored by the majority of the group. In terms of pseudo-data generation, we introduce a novel distance metric to adapt SMOTE for multi-view scenarios and develop an uncertainty-guided data generation module that produces high-quality pseudo-data, effectively mitigating the adverse effects of class imbalance. Extensive experiments on long-tailed multi-view datasets demonstrate that our model is capable of achieving superior performance. The code is released at https://github.com/cncq-tang/TMLC.

Conclusion: 所提出的链式框架为高斯过程回归提供了更鲁棒、无需输入依赖的全局与局部不确定性量化方法，提升了在安全关键应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: Gaussian process regression (GPR) is a popular nonparametric Bayesian method that provides predictive uncertainty estimates and is widely used in safety-critical applications. While prior research has introduced various uncertainty bounds, most existing approaches require access to specific input features and rely on posterior mean and variance estimates or tuning hyperparameters. These limitations hinder robustness and fail to capture the model's global behavior in expectation. To address these limitations, we propose a chaining-based framework for estimating upper and lower bounds on the expected extreme values over unseen data, without requiring access to specific input locations. We provide kernel-specific refinements for commonly used kernels such as RBF and Matérn, in which our bounds are tighter than generic constructions. We further improve numerical tightness by avoiding analytical relaxations. In addition to global estimation, we also develop a novel method for local uncertainty quantification at specified inputs. This approach leverages chaining geometry through partition diameters, adapting to local structure without relying on posterior variance scaling. Our experimental results validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Motivation: 现有无监督特征选择方法多独立评估特征，难以捕捉由相关特征组成的组结构中的有用信号，且部分考虑组结构的方法依赖预定义划分或标签监督，限制了适用性。

Method: GroupFS通过在特征图和样本图上施加拉普拉斯平滑，并采用组稀疏正则化项，实现对潜在特征组的联合发现与选择，整个框架端到端可微。

Result: 在涵盖图像、表格数据和生物数据集的九个基准上，GroupFS在聚类任务中 consistently 优于最先进的无监督特征选择方法，并选出与真实模式一致的特征组。

Conclusion: GroupFS有效解决了无监督场景下特征组发现与选择的问题，具备良好的通用性和可解释性，适用于多种高维数据任务。

Abstract: Unsupervised feature selection (FS) is essential for high-dimensional learning tasks where labels are not available. It helps reduce noise, improve generalization, and enhance interpretability. However, most existing unsupervised FS methods evaluate features in isolation, even though informative signals often emerge from groups of related features. For example, adjacent pixels, functionally connected brain regions, or correlated financial indicators tend to act together, making independent evaluation suboptimal. Although some methods attempt to capture group structure, they typically rely on predefined partitions or label supervision, limiting their applicability. We propose GroupFS, an end-to-end, fully differentiable framework that jointly discovers latent feature groups and selects the most informative groups among them, without relying on fixed a priori groups or label supervision. GroupFS enforces Laplacian smoothness on both feature and sample graphs and applies a group sparsity regularizer to learn a compact, structured representation. Across nine benchmarks spanning images, tabular data, and biological datasets, GroupFS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised FS in clustering and selects groups of features that align with meaningful patterns.

Motivation: 现有持续学习方法在避免灾难性遗忘方面表现不足，缺乏有效的紧凑记忆构建方案，尤其是在浅层网络中。

Method: 基于Khan和Swaroop [2021]的理论，将最优记忆搜索 formulation 为Hessian匹配问题，并采用概率PCA来估计最优记忆。

Result: 在Split-ImageNet上，使用0.3%数据量的记忆大小时准确率从30%提升至60%，2%时达到74%，接近批训练的77.6%。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建紧凑记忆提供了新方向，有望推动深度持续学习的发展。

Abstract: Despite recent progress, continual learning still does not match the performance of batch training. To avoid catastrophic forgetting, we need to build compact memory of essential past knowledge, but no clear solution has yet emerged, even for shallow neural networks with just one or two layers. In this paper, we present a new method to build compact memory for logistic regression. Our method is based on a result by Khan and Swaroop [2021] who show the existence of optimal memory for such models. We formulate the search for the optimal memory as Hessian-matching and propose a probabilistic PCA method to estimate them. Our approach can drastically improve accuracy compared to Experience Replay. For instance, on Split-ImageNet, we get 60% accuracy compared to 30% obtained by replay with memory-size equivalent to 0.3% of the data size. Increasing the memory size to 2% further boosts the accuracy to 74%, closing the gap to the batch accuracy of 77.6% on this task. Our work opens a new direction for building compact memory that can also be useful in the future for continual deep learning.

Conclusion: DFDT有效恢复了跨域轨迹的拼接性，理论证明其性能差距受MMD错配和OT偏差控制，二者减小则性能提升。

Abstract: Cross-domain shifts present a significant challenge for decision transformer (DT) policies. Existing cross-domain policy adaptation methods typically rely on a single simple filtering criterion to select source trajectory fragments and stitch them together. They match either state structure or action feasibility. However, the selected fragments still have poor stitchability: state structures can misalign, the return-to-go (RTG) becomes incomparable when the reward or horizon changes, and actions may jump at trajectory junctions. As a result, RTG tokens lose continuity, which compromises DT's inference ability. To tackle these challenges, we propose Data Fusion-Enhanced Decision Transformer (DFDT), a compact pipeline that restores stitchability. Particularly, DFDT fuses scarce target data with selectively trusted source fragments via a two-level data filter, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) mismatch for state-structure alignment, and optimal transport (OT) deviation for action feasibility. It then trains on a feasibility-weighted fusion distribution. Furthermore, DFDT replaces RTG tokens with advantage-conditioned tokens, which improves the continuity of the semantics in the token sequence. It also applies a $Q$-guided regularizer to suppress junction value and action jumps. Theoretically, we provide bounds that tie state value and policy performance gaps to the MMD-mismatch and OT-deviation measures, and show that the bounds tighten as these two measures shrink. We show that DFDT improves return and stability over strong offline RL and sequence-model baselines across gravity, kinematic, and morphology shifts on D4RL-style control tasks, and further corroborate these gains with token-stitching and sequence-semantics stability analyses.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FSampler 是一种无需训练、与采样器无关的执行层，通过减少函数评估次数来加速扩散模型采样，保持高保真度的同时显著降低计算时间和模型调用次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型采样通常需要大量函数评估，导致推理速度慢、计算成本高，因此需要一种通用且高效的方法来加速采样过程而不依赖特定模型或修改采样器公式。

Method: FSampler 利用有限差分预测器（二阶、三阶或四阶）基于近期去噪信号的历史外推下一个 epsilon，并在部分步骤中替代实际模型调用；通过学习稳定器校正漂移、梯度估计稳定器补偿局部曲率，并结合保护窗口、周期性锚点和跳步限制来控制轨迹偏差。

Result: 在 FLUX.1 dev、Qwen Image 和 Wan 2.2 模型上，FSampler 在高保真度下（SSIM 0.95–0.99）减少 8%–22% 时间和 15%–25% 模型调用；使用激进自适应门控时，在较低保真度下（SSIM 0.73–0.74）可减少 45%–50% 模型调用。

Conclusion: FSampler 能有效加速多种主流扩散采样器的执行，兼容性强，无需训练或修改采样器更新规则，是一种高效、稳定的采样加速方案。

Abstract: FSampler is a training free, sampler agnostic execution layer that accelerates diffusion sampling by reducing the number of function evaluations (NFE). FSampler maintains a short history of denoising signals (epsilon) from recent real model calls and extrapolates the next epsilon using finite difference predictors at second order, third order, or fourth order, falling back to lower order when history is insufficient. On selected steps the predicted epsilon substitutes the model call while keeping each sampler's update rule unchanged. Predicted epsilons are validated for finiteness and magnitude; a learning stabilizer rescales predictions on skipped steps to correct drift, and an optional gradient estimation stabilizer compensates local curvature. Protected windows, periodic anchors, and a cap on consecutive skips bound deviation over the trajectory. Operating at the sampler level, FSampler integrates with Euler/DDIM, DPM++ 2M/2S, LMS/AB2, and RES family exponential multistep methods and drops into standard workflows. FLUX.1 dev, Qwen Image, and Wan 2.2, FSampler reduces time by 8 to 22% and model calls by 15 to 25% at high fidelity (Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) 0.95 to 0.99), without altering sampler formulas. With an aggressive adaptive gate, reductions can reach 45 to 50% fewer model calls at lower fidelity (SSIM 0.73 to 0.74).

Conclusion: IPBT能自动高效地优化PBT中的关键元超参数，具有良好的通用性和性能优势。

Abstract: Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) can lift the burden of tuning hyperparameters (HPs) of neural networks. HPO algorithms from the Population Based Training (PBT) family are efficient thanks to dynamically adjusting HPs every few steps of the weight optimization. Recent results indicate that the number of steps between HP updates is an important meta-HP of all PBT variants that can substantially affect their performance. Yet, no method or intuition is available for efficiently setting its value. We introduce Iterated Population Based Training (IPBT), a novel PBT variant that automatically adjusts this HP via restarts that reuse weight information in a task-agnostic way and leverage time-varying Bayesian optimization to reinitialize HPs. Evaluation on 8 image classification and reinforcement learning tasks shows that, on average, our algorithm matches or outperforms 5 previous PBT variants and other HPO algorithms (random search, ASHA, SMAC3), without requiring a budget increase or any changes to its HPs.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used for many applications. To prevent illicit use, it is desirable to be able to detect AI-generated text. Training and evaluation of such detectors critically depend on suitable benchmark datasets. Several groups took on the tedious work of collecting, curating, and publishing large and diverse datasets for this task. However, it remains an open challenge to ensure high quality in all relevant aspects of such a dataset. For example, the DetectRL benchmark exhibits relatively simple patterns of AI-generation in 98.5% of the Claude-LLM data. These patterns may include introductory words such as "Sure! Here is the academic article abstract:", or instances where the LLM rejects the prompted task. In this work, we demonstrate that detectors trained on such data use such patterns as shortcuts, which facilitates spoofing attacks on the trained detectors. We consequently reprocessed the DetectRL dataset with several cleansing operations. Experiments show that such data cleansing makes direct attacks more difficult. The reprocessed dataset is publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN方法在目标函数和模型结构上未能对齐MILP问题的内在结构，忽略变量优先级和约束内的竞争关系。

Conclusion: CoCo-MILP通过显式建模变量间对比和约束内竞争，有效提升了MILP解预测的准确性与求解效率。

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a cornerstone of combinatorial optimization, yet solving large-scale instances remains a significant computational challenge. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promise in accelerating MILP solvers by predicting high-quality solutions. However, we identify that existing methods misalign with the intrinsic structure of MILP problems at two levels. At the leaning objective level, the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss treats variables independently, neglecting their relative priority and yielding plausible logits. At the model architecture level, standard GNN message passing inherently smooths the representations across variables, missing the natural competitive relationships within constraints. To address these challenges, we propose CoCo-MILP, which explicitly models inter-variable Contrast and intra-constraint Competition for advanced MILP solution prediction. At the objective level, CoCo-MILP introduces the Inter-Variable Contrastive Loss (VCL), which explicitly maximizes the embedding margin between variables assigned one versus zero. At the architectural level, we design an Intra-Constraint Competitive GNN layer that, instead of homogenizing features, learns to differentiate representations of competing variables within a constraint, capturing their exclusionary nature. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that CoCo-MILP significantly outperforms existing learning-based approaches, reducing the solution gap by up to 68.12% compared to traditional solvers.

Conclusion: SCMax是一种有效的无参数聚类框架，能够自动确定最优聚类数量，并在性能上超越现有方法。

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental task in unsupervised learning, but most existing methods heavily rely on hyperparameters such as the number of clusters or other sensitive settings, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this long-standing challenge, we propose a novel and fully parameter-free clustering framework via Self-supervised Consensus Maximization, named SCMax. Our framework performs hierarchical agglomerative clustering and cluster evaluation in a single, integrated process. At each step of agglomeration, it creates a new, structure-aware data representation through a self-supervised learning task guided by the current clustering structure. We then introduce a nearest neighbor consensus score, which measures the agreement between the nearest neighbor-based merge decisions suggested by the original representation and the self-supervised one. The moment at which consensus maximization occurs can serve as a criterion for determining the optimal number of clusters. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing clustering approaches designed for scenarios with an unknown number of clusters.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Feynman-Kac（FK）推理时控制框架的扩散模型扩展方法，用于引导蛋白质设计中的结构和序列生成，以实现特定功能目标，如结合亲和力优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型虽能生成多样且真实的蛋白质结构，但在朝特定生化或功能目标（如结合亲和力、序列组成）引导方面仍受限，因此需要一种灵活且高效的引导机制。

Method: 扩展Feynman-Kac（FK）推理时控制框架，结合扩散模型，在采样过程中通过非可微奖励函数引导生成过程；利用ProteinMPNN和全原子优化计算奖励，实现结构与序列的联合生成与优化。

Result: 在结合蛋白设计中，FK引导显著改善了不同靶标上的界面能量预测，同时保持生成多样性，并具有极低的计算开销。

Conclusion: FK引导框架可推广至任意、非可微、奖励无关的目标，为基于扩散的分子生成提供了统一且模型无关的指导范式。

Abstract: Diffusion-based models have recently enabled the generation of realistic and diverse protein structures, yet they remain limited in their ability to steer outcomes toward specific functional or biochemical objectives, such as binding affinity or sequence composition. Here we extend the Feynman-Kac (FK) steering framework, an inference-time control approach, to diffusion-based protein design. By coupling FK steering with structure generation, the method guides sampling toward desirable structural or energetic features while maintaining the diversity of the underlying diffusion process. To enable simultaneous generation of both sequence and structure properties, rewards are computed on models refined through ProteinMPNN and all-atom relaxation. Applied to binder design, FK steering consistently improves predicted interface energetics across diverse targets with minimal computational overhead. More broadly, this work demonstrates that inference-time FK control generalizes diffusion-based protein design to arbitrary, non-differentiable, and reward-agnostic objectives, providing a unified and model-independent framework for guided molecular generation.

Result: 在四个标准MILP基准上的实验表明，该方法显著优于此前最先进的强化学习分支策略。

Conclusion: 引入基于模型的强化学习和规划机制可有效提升MILP求解中分支策略的学习效果，为组合优化问题提供了新方向。

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) lies at the core of many real-world combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, traditionally solved by branch-and-bound (B&B). A key driver influencing B&B solvers efficiency is the variable selection heuristic that guides branching decisions. Looking to move beyond static, hand-crafted heuristics, recent work has explored adapting traditional reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to the B&B setting, aiming to learn branching strategies tailored to specific MILP distributions. In parallel, RL agents have achieved remarkable success in board games, a very specific type of combinatorial problems, by leveraging environment simulators to plan via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Building on these developments, we introduce Plan-and-Branch-and-Bound (PlanB&B), a model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) agent that leverages a learned internal model of the B&B dynamics to discover improved branching strategies. Computational experiments empirically validate our approach, with our MBRL branching agent outperforming previous state-of-the-art RL methods across four standard MILP benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种分布式图神经网络（GNN）训练框架，用于解决大规模复杂图上的组合优化问题，结合子图划分和强化学习，在真实和合成数据上实现了优于现有方法的性能和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 所提出的分布式GNN-RL框架有效解决了GNN在大规模组合优化中的可扩展性和跨子图协调问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely applied in tackling combinatorial optimization problems. However, existing methods still suffer from limited accuracy when addressing that on complex graphs and exhibit poor scalability, since full training requires loading the whole adjacent matrix and all embeddings at a time, the it may results in out of memory of a single machine. This limitation significantly restricts their applicability to large-scale scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a distributed GNN-based training framework for combinatorial optimization. In details, firstly, large graph is partition into several small subgraphs. Then the individual subgraphs are full trained, providing a foundation for efficient local optimization. Finally, reinforcement learning (RL) are employed to take actions according to GNN output, to make sure the restrictions between cross nodes can be learned. Extensive experiments are conducted on both real large-scale social network datasets (e.g., Facebook, Youtube) and synthetically generated high-complexity graphs, which demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both solution quality and computational efficiency. Moreover, the experiments on large graph instances also validate the scalability of the model.

Motivation: 理解预测编码在何种条件下能够形成反映环境潜在结构的低维内部表征尚不明确，本文旨在探究预测视野和网络深度对表征学习的影响。

Method: 基于简化抽象模型，结合普通最小二乘估计器的结构与学习动态偏差，从理论和实验上分析深度网络在多步预测任务中的表现，并推广至非线性网络和复杂数据集。

Result: 发现足够深的网络在多步预测下能稳定恢复潜在结构，并在MNIST、分段线性函数等多种设置中验证了该现象的有效性。

Conclusion: 预测视野与网络深度共同决定了预测编码能否成功学习结构化表征，为连接经验观察与理论基础提供了原则性解释。

Abstract: Predictive coding is a framework for understanding the formation of low-dimensional internal representations mirroring the environment's latent structure. The conditions under which such representations emerge remain unclear. In this work, we investigate how the prediction horizon and network depth shape the solutions of predictive coding tasks. Using a minimal abstract setting inspired by prior work, we show empirically and theoretically that sufficiently deep networks trained with multi-step prediction horizons consistently recover the underlying latent structure, a phenomenon explained through the Ordinary Least Squares estimator structure and biases in learning dynamics. We then extend these insights to nonlinear networks and complex datasets, including piecewise linear functions, MNIST, multiple latent states and higher dimensional state geometries. Our results provide a principled understanding of when and why predictive coding induces structured representations, bridging the gap between empirical observations and theoretical foundations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了双面攻击（DFA），可同时破坏联邦学习中的模型准确性和群体公平性，并提出GuardFed防御框架，通过自适应信任评分机制有效抵御此类攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的联邦学习攻击研究多关注单一目标（效用或公平性），而能同时损害两者的方法尚未充分探索。本文旨在填补这一空白，提出更现实且更具威胁的联合攻击模型。

Method: 提出Dual-Facet Attack（DFA），包括S-DFA和Sp-DFA两种变体，模拟不同共谋场景；并设计GuardFed防御框架，利用少量干净数据和合成样本维护公平性感知的参考模型，通过计算客户端在效用偏差和公平性退化两方面的信任得分，实现选择性聚合。

Result: 实验表明，现有鲁棒聚合方法对DFA无效，而GuardFed在多种非独立同分布和对抗条件下，均能有效保持高准确率和高公平性，优于现有防御方法。

Conclusion: DFA揭示了联邦学习中效用与公平性联合攻击的新风险，GuardFed提供了一种自适应、双视角的防御方案，显著提升了系统在复杂威胁下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative model training but remains vulnerable to adversarial behaviors that compromise model utility or fairness across sensitive groups. While extensive studies have examined attacks targeting either objective, strategies that simultaneously degrade both utility and fairness remain largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Dual-Facet Attack (DFA), a novel threat model that concurrently undermines predictive accuracy and group fairness. Two variants, Synchronous DFA (S-DFA) and Split DFA (Sp-DFA), are further proposed to capture distinct real-world collusion scenarios. Experimental results show that existing robust FL defenses, including hybrid aggregation schemes, fail to resist DFAs effectively. To counter these threats, we propose GuardFed, a self-adaptive defense framework that maintains a fairness-aware reference model using a small amount of clean server data augmented with synthetic samples. In each training round, GuardFed computes a dual-perspective trust score for every client by jointly evaluating its utility deviation and fairness degradation, thereby enabling selective aggregation of trustworthy updates. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that GuardFed consistently preserves both accuracy and fairness under diverse non-IID and adversarial conditions, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared with existing robust FL methods.

Motivation: 神经网络因其黑盒特性导致决策缺乏透明度和可信度，现有解释方法常存在不忠实的问题，而现有的转化为决策树的方法在精确性、可扩展性或可解释性方面存在不足。

Method: 通过推广先前工作，将包含卷积神经网络、循环神经网络、非ReLU激活函数和偏置项的神经网络精确转换为多变量决策树，并提出RENTT算法以提高运行效率和内存效率，同时基于等价决策树计算不同层次的特征重要性。

Conclusion: RENTT能够高效生成神经网络的精确决策树表示，并提供可靠的特征重要性评估，为提升深度模型的可解释性提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Although neural networks are a powerful tool, their widespread use is hindered by the opacity of their decisions and their black-box nature, which result in a lack of trustworthiness. To alleviate this problem, methods in the field of explainable Artificial Intelligence try to unveil how such automated decisions are made. But explainable AI methods are often plagued by missing faithfulness/correctness, meaning that they sometimes provide explanations that do not align with the neural network's decision and logic. Recently, transformations to decision trees have been proposed to overcome such problems. Unfortunately, they typically lack exactness, scalability, or interpretability as the size of the neural network grows. Thus, we generalize these previous results, especially by considering convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, non-ReLU activation functions, and bias terms. Our findings are accompanied by rigorous proofs and we present a novel algorithm RENTT (Runtime Efficient Network to Tree Transformation) designed to compute an exact equivalent decision tree representation of neural networks in a manner that is both runtime and memory efficient. The resulting decision trees are multivariate and thus, possibly too complex to understand. To alleviate this problem, we also provide a method to calculate the ground truth feature importance for neural networks via the equivalent decision trees - for entire models (global), specific input regions (regional), or single decisions (local). All theoretical results are supported by detailed numerical experiments that emphasize two key aspects: the computational efficiency and scalability of our algorithm, and that only RENTT succeeds in uncovering ground truth explanations compared to conventional approximation methods like LIME and SHAP. All code is available at https://github.com/HelenaM23/RENTT .

Conclusion: TCNN在保持低复杂度的同时显著提升了泛化能力和鲁棒性，尤其在对抗噪声攻击时表现突出，验证了其结构设计的有效性。

Abstract: It is challenging to reduce the complexity of neural networks while maintaining their generalization ability and robustness, especially for practical applications. Conventional solutions for this problem incorporate quantum-inspired neural networks with Kronecker products and hybrid tensor neural networks with MPO factorization and fully-connected layers. Nonetheless, the generalization power and robustness of the fully-connected layers are not as outstanding as circuit models in quantum computing. In this paper, we propose a novel tensor circuit neural network (TCNN) that takes advantage of the characteristics of tensor neural networks and residual circuit models to achieve generalization ability and robustness with low complexity. The proposed activation operation and parallelism of the circuit in complex number field improves its non-linearity and efficiency for feature learning. Moreover, since the feature information exists in the parameters in both the real and imaginary parts in TCNN, an information fusion layer is proposed for merging features stored in those parameters to enhance the generalization capability. Experimental results confirm that TCNN showcases more outstanding generalization and robustness with its average accuracies on various datasets 2\%-3\% higher than those of the state-of-the-art compared models. More significantly, while other models fail to learn features under noise parameter attacking, TCNN still showcases prominent learning capability owing to its ability to prevent gradient explosion. Furthermore, it is comparable to the compared models on the number of trainable parameters and the CPU running time. An ablation study also indicates the advantage of the activation operation, the parallelism architecture and the information fusion layer.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Mixture-of-Channels (MoC)的新型前馈网络架构，通过选择性激活SwiGLU门控机制中每token最相关的Top-K通道，显著减少大语言模型中的激活内存开销，同时保持良好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型规模的增大，激活内存（尤其是来自前馈网络FFN的部分）已成为训练和推理的主要瓶颈，尤其是在使用FlashAttention的情况下，因此需要有效降低激活内存消耗。

Method: 通过对LLM进行详细的内存分析，识别出FFN激活是主要内存开销来源，并提出MoC架构，利用SwiGLU的原生门控机制选择Top-K通道进行激活，实现部分权重加载到GPU SRAM以减少内存访问。

Result: 实验表明，MoC在预训练和推理阶段均显著减少了激活内存占用，提高了吞吐量，同时保持了与原始模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: MoC是一种高效且兼容现有训练框架的FFN架构改进方法，能有效缓解大模型中的激活内存瓶颈，提升训练和推理效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across diverse artificial intelligence tasks, driven by scaling laws that correlate model size and training data with performance improvements. However, this scaling paradigm incurs substantial memory overhead, creating significant challenges for both training and inference. While existing research has primarily addressed parameter and optimizer state memory reduction, activation memory-particularly from feed-forward networks (FFNs)-has become the critical bottleneck, especially when FlashAttention is implemented. In this work, we conduct a detailed memory profiling of LLMs and identify FFN activations as the predominant source to activation memory overhead. Motivated by this, we introduce Mixture-of-Channels (MoC), a novel FFN architecture that selectively activates only the Top-K most relevant channels per token determined by SwiGLU's native gating mechanism. MoC substantially reduces activation memory during pre-training and improves inference efficiency by reducing memory access through partial weight loading into GPU SRAM. Extensive experiments validate that MoC delivers significant memory savings and throughput gains while maintaining competitive model performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了MARBLE模型，通过引入隐马尔可夫状态来增强Restless Multi-Armed Bandits（RMABs），以应对非平稳环境中的决策问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RMAB模型假设环境动态是固定的，但在现实世界中环境往往是非平稳的，因此需要更灵活的模型来处理这种变化。

Method: 提出了一种新的模型MARBLE，该模型结合了潜在的马尔可夫状态来捕捉环境的变化，并引入了Markov-Averaged Indexability (MAI)准则作为松弛的可索引性假设。使用同步Q-learning与Whittle指数(QWI)方法进行策略学习。

Result: 证明了在MAI准则下，即使存在未观察到的状态切换，同步Q-learning与Whittle指数也能几乎必然收敛到最优Q函数和相应的Whittle指数。实验验证了QWI能够在模拟器嵌入的推荐系统中适应变化的潜在状态并收敛到最优策略。

Conclusion: MARBLE模型及其QWI算法能够有效处理非平稳环境下的决策问题，具有良好的理论保证和实证表现。

Abstract: Restless Multi-Armed Bandits (RMABs) are powerful models for decision-making under uncertainty, yet classical formulations typically assume fixed dynamics, an assumption often violated in nonstationary environments. We introduce MARBLE (Multi-Armed Restless Bandits in a Latent Markovian Environment), which augments RMABs with a latent Markov state that induces nonstationary behavior. In MARBLE, each arm evolves according to a latent environment state that switches over time, making policy learning substantially more challenging. We further introduce the Markov-Averaged Indexability (MAI) criterion as a relaxed indexability assumption and prove that, despite unobserved regime switches, under the MAI criterion, synchronous Q-learning with Whittle Indices (QWI) converges almost surely to the optimal Q-function and the corresponding Whittle indices. We validate MARBLE on a calibrated simulator-embedded (digital twin) recommender system, where QWI consistently adapts to a shifting latent state and converges to an optimal policy, empirically corroborating our theoretical findings.

Conclusion: AdaCuRL有效解决了混合难度样本下的训练难题，无需依赖高质量人工标注，实现了稳定且高效的推理能力提升，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated considerable potential for enhancing reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods suffer from Gradient Starvation and Policy Degradation when training directly on samples with mixed difficulty. To mitigate this, prior approaches leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data, but the construction of high-quality CoT annotations remains labor-intensive. Alternatively, curriculum learning strategies have been explored but frequently encounter challenges, such as difficulty mismatch, reliance on manual curriculum design, and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose AdaCuRL, a Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates coarse-to-fine difficulty estimation with adaptive curriculum scheduling. This approach dynamically aligns data difficulty with model capability and incorporates a data revisitation mechanism to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, AdaCuRL employs adaptive reference and sparse KL strategies to prevent Policy Degradation. Extensive experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that AdaCuRL consistently achieves significant performance improvements on both LLMs and MLLMs.

Abstract: GAMMA_FLOW is an open-source Python package for real-time analysis of spectral data. It supports classification, denoising, decomposition, and outlier detection of both single- and multi-component spectra. Instead of relying on large, computationally intensive models, it employs a supervised approach to non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) for dimensionality reduction. This ensures a fast, efficient, and adaptable analysis while reducing computational costs. gamma_flow achieves classification accuracies above 90% and enables reliable automated spectral interpretation. Originally developed for gamma-ray spectra, it is applicable to any type of one-dimensional spectral data. As an open and flexible alternative to proprietary software, it supports various applications in research and industry.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个形式化的特征归因问题定义，并提出了新的模型无关的DFAX方法，直接基于数据分布解释分类器预测，实验证明其比现有方法更有效和高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂的黑箱AI模型日益增多，需要可解释其决策的技术。现有的特征归因方法缺乏形式化的问题定义，许多方法无法满足基于数据分布进行解释的要求。

Method: 提出形式化的特征归因问题定义，要求解释基于数据集所表示的概率分布；设计了新的模型无关方法DFAX，首次直接基于数据分布进行特征归因。

Result: 分析显示许多现有方法不满足新定义的标准，DFAX在大量实验中表现出优于当前最先进基线方法的效果和效率。

Conclusion: DFAX是一种更有效、高效的特征归因方法，为基于数据分布的解释提供了新的思路，推动了可解释AI的发展。

Abstract: The proliferation of complex, black-box AI models has intensified the need for techniques that can explain their decisions. Feature attribution methods have become a popular solution for providing post-hoc explanations, yet the field has historically lacked a formal problem definition. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a formal definition for the problem of feature attribution, which stipulates that explanations be supported by an underlying probability distribution represented by the given dataset. Our analysis reveals that many existing model-agnostic methods fail to meet this criterion, while even those that do often possess other limitations. To overcome these challenges, we propose Distributional Feature Attribution eXplanations (DFAX), a novel, model-agnostic method for feature attribution. DFAX is the first feature attribution method to explain classifier predictions directly based on the data distribution. We show through extensive experiments that DFAX is more effective and efficient than state-of-the-art baselines.

*Alexander Nadel,Ron Wettenstein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WOODELF是一种新的SHAP算法，结合决策树、博弈论和布尔逻辑，能在CPU和GPU上高效计算多种SHAP变体及其他游戏理论值，显著提升计算速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SHAP计算方法在效率和灵活性上存在局限，尤其在大规模数据集上计算背景SHAP耗时较长，需要更高效的统一算法。

Method: WOODELF为每个样本构建伪布尔公式，融合特征值、树结构和背景数据集信息，并基于此在线性时间内计算Background SHAP及其他扩展值（如Path-Dependent SHAP、Shapley/Banzhaf交互值等）。

Result: 在300万行、127特征和500万背景样本的数据上，WOODELF在CPU上用162秒、GPU上仅16秒完成计算，相较最优方法提速16倍和165倍。

Conclusion: WOODELF提供了一个高效、灵活且易于集成的框架，支持大规模场景下多种游戏理论解释值的快速计算，推动了模型可解释性的实际应用。

Abstract: SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is a key tool for interpreting decision tree ensembles by assigning contribution values to features. It is widely used in finance, advertising, medicine, and other domains. Two main approaches to SHAP calculation exist: Path-Dependent SHAP, which leverages the tree structure for efficiency, and Background SHAP, which uses a background dataset to estimate feature distributions.
  We introduce WOODELF, a SHAP algorithm that integrates decision trees, game theory, and Boolean logic into a unified framework. For each consumer, WOODELF constructs a pseudo-Boolean formula that captures their feature values, the structure of the decision tree ensemble, and the entire background dataset. It then leverages this representation to compute Background SHAP in linear time. WOODELF can also compute Path-Dependent SHAP, Shapley interaction values, Banzhaf values, and Banzhaf interaction values.
  WOODELF is designed to run efficiently on CPU and GPU hardware alike. Available via the WOODELF Python package, it is implemented using NumPy, SciPy, and CuPy without relying on custom C++ or CUDA code. This design enables fast performance and seamless integration into existing frameworks, supporting large-scale computation of SHAP and other game-theoretic values in practice.
  For example, on a dataset with 3,000,000 rows, 5,000,000 background samples, and 127 features, WOODELF computed all Background Shapley values in 162 seconds on CPU and 16 seconds on GPU - compared to 44 minutes required by the best method on any hardware platform, representing 16x and 165x speedups, respectively.

*Rüveyda Yilmaz,Julian Thull,Johannes Stegmaier,Volkmar Schulz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出使用条件扩散模型来插值稀疏采样的正电子发射断层扫描（PET）数据，以支持非约束探测器布局，从而实现新型、低成本且对患者友好的PET几何结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PET设备受限于完整的圆柱形探测器设计，而实际应用中需要更灵活的开放或不完整结构，导致数据严重欠采样，因此需要新方法来恢复缺失信息。

Method: 将缺失的响应线视为可学习先验，采用基于数据驱动的生成模型，特别是条件扩散模型，对稀疏采样的sinogram进行插值恢复。

Result: 验证了条件扩散模型在处理非标准、不完整PET探测器布局下的sinogram重建能力，能够有效恢复欠采样数据。

Conclusion: 该方法为未来灵活、低成本和患者友好的PET系统设计提供了可行的技术路径。

Abstract: Accurate PET imaging increasingly requires methods that support unconstrained detector layouts from walk-through designs to long-axial rings where gaps and open sides lead to severely undersampled sinograms. Instead of constraining the hardware to form complete cylinders, we propose treating the missing lines-of-responses as a learnable prior. Data-driven approaches, particularly generative models, offer a promising pathway to recover this missing information. In this work, we explore the use of conditional diffusion models to interpolate sparsely sampled sinograms, paving the way for novel, cost-efficient, and patient-friendly PET geometries in real clinical settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于约束强化学习的隐蔽式配置污染攻击方法CREAT，用于在保持难以检测的同时有效干扰序列推荐系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法依赖数据投毒，需要大规模用户访问或伪造账户，实用性低；且当前配置污染攻击方法过度依赖序列层面的影响，缺乏细粒度控制，易引起可检测的分布偏移。

Method: 提出CREAT方法，结合双层优化框架与多奖励强化学习：设计模式平衡奖励策略，通过模式反转奖励和分布一致性奖励（利用非平衡协同最优传输）实现精准扰动并减少可检测性；采用约束组相对强化学习范式，通过动态屏障约束和组共享经验回放实现逐歩扰动。

Result: 实验表明CREAT在多种序列推荐模型上具有较强的攻击有效性，同时保持较低的可检测性，优于现有PPA方法。

Conclusion: CREAT通过精细化控制用户交互扰动，在保证隐蔽性的同时实现了高效的针对性攻击，为序列推荐系统的安全性评估提供了新思路。

Abstract: Sequential Recommenders, which exploit dynamic user intents through interaction sequences, is vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While existing attacks primarily rely on data poisoning, they require large-scale user access or fake profiles thus lacking practicality. In this paper, we focus on the Profile Pollution Attack that subtly contaminates partial user interactions to induce targeted mispredictions. Previous PPA methods suffer from two limitations, i.e., i) over-reliance on sequence horizon impact restricts fine-grained perturbations on item transitions, and ii) holistic modifications cause detectable distribution shifts. To address these challenges, we propose a constrained reinforcement driven attack CREAT that synergizes a bi-level optimization framework with multi-reward reinforcement learning to balance adversarial efficacy and stealthiness. We first develop a Pattern Balanced Rewarding Policy, which integrates pattern inversion rewards to invert critical patterns and distribution consistency rewards to minimize detectable shifts via unbalanced co-optimal transport. Then we employ a Constrained Group Relative Reinforcement Learning paradigm, enabling step-wise perturbations through dynamic barrier constraints and group-shared experience replay, achieving targeted pollution with minimal detectability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CREAT.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为抽象梯度训练（AGT）的统一框架，用于认证模型对训练数据扰动的鲁棒性，涵盖数据点的删除、添加和有界扰动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练数据扰动（如对抗性投毒、机器遗忘和差分隐私）可能严重影响模型行为，但目前缺乏有效的认证方法。

Method: 通过在参数空间中界定由一阶优化方法训练的模型的可达参数集，利用抽象解释技术推导出模型参数的可证明边界。

Result: AGT 能够为多种训练数据扰动提供形式化鲁棒性保证，并在三种关键场景下实现统一的认证框架。

Conclusion: AGT 为应对训练数据扰动提供了通用且可证明的鲁棒性认证方法，推动了对抗性鲁棒性、机器遗忘与差分隐私之间的统一理解。

Abstract: The impact of inference-time data perturbation (e.g., adversarial attacks) has been extensively studied in machine learning, leading to well-established certification techniques for adversarial robustness. In contrast, certifying models against training data perturbations remains a relatively under-explored area. These perturbations can arise in three critical contexts: adversarial data poisoning, where an adversary manipulates training samples to corrupt model performance; machine unlearning, which requires certifying model behavior under the removal of specific training data; and differential privacy, where guarantees must be given with respect to substituting individual data points. This work introduces Abstract Gradient Training (AGT), a unified framework for certifying robustness of a given model and training procedure to training data perturbations, including bounded perturbations, the removal of data points, and the addition of new samples. By bounding the reachable set of parameters, i.e., establishing provable parameter-space bounds, AGT provides a formal approach to analyzing the behavior of models trained via first-order optimization methods.

*Qiming Guo,Wenbo Sun,Wenlu Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CallosumNet的时空图遗忘框架，通过分而治之策略实现高效节点删除，适用于隐私敏感场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遗忘方法难以高效删除时空图中的节点，因信息在时空维度上全局扩散，导致遗忘成本接近重新训练模型。

Method: 受胼胝体结构启发，设计了增强子图构建（ESC）和全局神经节桥接（GGB）技术，将图分解为局部子图并重建全局依赖。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上，CallosumNet在完全遗忘后仅引入1%-2%的相对MAE损失，显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: CallosumNet为时空图数据提供了高效、可扩展的遗忘学习解决方案，兼顾性能与隐私合规需求。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal graphs are widely used in modeling complex dynamic processes such as traffic forecasting, molecular dynamics, and healthcare monitoring. Recently, stringent privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA have introduced significant new challenges for existing spatio-temporal graph models, requiring complete unlearning of unauthorized data. Since each node in a spatio-temporal graph diffuses information globally across both spatial and temporal dimensions, existing unlearning methods primarily designed for static graphs and localized data removal cannot efficiently erase a single node without incurring costs nearly equivalent to full model retraining. Therefore, an effective approach for complete spatio-temporal graph unlearning is a pressing need. To address this, we propose CallosumNet, a divide-and-conquer spatio-temporal graph unlearning framework inspired by the corpus callosum structure that facilitates communication between the brain's two hemispheres. CallosumNet incorporates two novel techniques: (1) Enhanced Subgraph Construction (ESC), which adaptively constructs multiple localized subgraphs based on several factors, including biologically-inspired virtual ganglions; and (2) Global Ganglion Bridging (GGB), which reconstructs global spatio-temporal dependencies from these localized subgraphs, effectively restoring the full graph representation. Empirical results on four diverse real-world datasets show that CallosumNet achieves complete unlearning with only 1%-2% relative MAE loss compared to the gold model, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness of both proposed techniques.

*Jiao Chen,Weihua Li,Jianhua Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需保留数据的遗忘框架PTE，通过探测-编辑机制实现高效知识删除，仅使用需遗忘的数据和原始模型即可在多个基准上取得良好的遗忘效果与模型效用平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态工业物联网环境中，现有遗忘方法依赖保留数据以约束模型行为，增加了计算和能耗负担，并与数据孤岛及隐私合规要求冲突。因此需要一种无需保留数据的知识遗忘方法。

Method: 将遗忘过程建模为探测-编辑（Probing then Editing, PTE）流程：首先通过梯度上升探测目标类别的决策边界邻域，并利用模型自身预测生成编辑指令；随后采用推-拉协同优化机制，推分支利用编辑指令主动瓦解目标类别的决策区域，拉分支通过掩码知识蒸馏将保留类别的知识锚定回原始状态。

Result: 实验表明，PTE在CWRU、SCUT-FD等多个通用和工业基准上实现了高效的遗忘效果与良好的模型效用保持，显著降低了对保留数据的依赖。

Conclusion: PTE是一种无需保留数据的知识遗忘框架，能够在不访问保留数据的情况下有效删除特定知识，同时保持模型整体性能，适用于工业物联网等存在数据隔离与隐私限制的场景。

Abstract: In dynamic Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments, models need the ability to selectively forget outdated or erroneous knowledge. However, existing methods typically rely on retain data to constrain model behavior, which increases computational and energy burdens and conflicts with industrial data silos and privacy compliance requirements. To address this, we propose a novel retain-free unlearning framework, referred to as Probing then Editing (PTE). PTE frames unlearning as a probe-edit process: first, it probes the decision boundary neighborhood of the model on the to-be-forgotten class via gradient ascent and generates corresponding editing instructions using the model's own predictions. Subsequently, a push-pull collaborative optimization is performed: the push branch actively dismantles the decision region of the target class using the editing instructions, while the pull branch applies masked knowledge distillation to anchor the model's knowledge on retained classes to their original states. Benefiting from this mechanism, PTE achieves efficient and balanced knowledge editing using only the to-be-forgotten data and the original model. Experimental results demonstrate that PTE achieves an excellent balance between unlearning effectiveness and model utility across multiple general and industrial benchmarks such as CWRU and SCUT-FD.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformer Semantic Genetic Programming (TSGP) 利用预训练的transformer模型作为变异算子，生成与父代程序语义相似的后代，在24个数据集上显著优于多种现有方法，且能通过目标语义距离控制探索与利用的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语义遗传编程依赖固定的语法变换，缺乏多样性；TSGP旨在利用预训练transformer模型学习多样化的结构变异，实现对语义空间更有效的搜索。

Method: 将预训练的transformer模型用作变异操作符，通过设定目标语义距离（SD_t）来控制生成后代与父代之间的语义相似度，从而在语义空间中进行可控的搜索。

Result: 在24个真实和合成数据集上，TSGP显著优于标准GP、SLIM_GSGP、Deep Symbolic Regression和Denoising Autoencoder GP，平均排名为1.58；同时生成比SLIM_GSGP更紧凑的程序。SD_t参数可有效调节程序大小与收敛速度之间的权衡。

Conclusion: TSGP通过引入基于transformer的语义变异操作，提升了遗传编程在符号回归任务中的性能和效率，展示了深度学习模型与进化算法结合的潜力。

Abstract: Transformer Semantic Genetic Programming (TSGP) is a semantic search approach that uses a pre-trained transformer model as a variation operator to generate offspring programs with controlled semantic similarity to a given parent. Unlike other semantic GP approaches that rely on fixed syntactic transformations, TSGP aims to learn diverse structural variations that lead to solutions with similar semantics. We find that a single transformer model trained on millions of programs is able to generalize across symbolic regression problems of varying dimension. Evaluated on 24 real-world and synthetic datasets, TSGP significantly outperforms standard GP, SLIM_GSGP, Deep Symbolic Regression, and Denoising Autoencoder GP, achieving an average rank of 1.58 across all benchmarks. Moreover, TSGP produces more compact solutions than SLIM_GSGP, despite its higher accuracy. In addition, the target semantic distance $\mathrm{SD}_t$ is able to control the step size in the semantic space: small values of $\mathrm{SD}_t$ enable consistent improvement in fitness but often lead to larger programs, while larger values promote faster convergence and compactness. Thus, $\mathrm{SD}_t$ provides an effective mechanism for balancing exploration and exploitation.

Method: 引入特征误差度量（FEM），结合过参数化的序列模型，分析自适应特征程序在不同模型（如线性回归、单/多指标模型）中的训练过程。

Result: 证明了在多种具体自适应特征模型中，FEM在训练过程中是递减的，表明所学特征质量逐步提升。

Conclusion: FEM的递减趋势为自适应特征程序的有效性提供了支持，暗示该框架有望成功用于理解神经网络的特征学习机制。

Abstract: Theoretically exploring the advantages of neural networks might be one of the most challenging problems in the AI era. An adaptive feature program has recently been proposed to analyze the feature learning characteristic property of neural networks in a more abstract way. Motivated by the celebrated Le Cam equivalence, we advocate the over-parametrized sequence models to further simplify the analysis of the training dynamics of adaptive feature program and present several supporting evidences for the adaptive feature program. More precisely, after having introduced the feature error measure (FEM) to characterize the quality of the learned feature, we show that the FEM is decreasing during the training process of several concrete adaptive feature models including linear regression, single/multiple index models, etc. We believe that this hints at the potential successes of the adaptive feature program.

Motivation: 传统SAE在处理具有群对称性的非语言数据（如旋转图像）时效果受限，需增强其对称性建模能力。

Method: 分析合成图像上SAE激活的变换规律，发现单一矩阵可描述旋转下的变化；据此构建能自适应基础模型等变程度的等变SAE。

Result: 自适应等变SAE相比常规SAE在探针任务中表现更优，提取的特征更具实用性。

Conclusion: 将群对称性融入SAE可提升其在科学数据等非语言领域的机制可解释性与应用效果。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have proven useful in disentangling the opaque activations of neural networks, primarily large language models, into sets of interpretable features. However, adapting them to domains beyond language, such as scientific data with group symmetries, introduces challenges that can hinder their effectiveness. We show that incorporating such group symmetries into the SAEs yields features more useful in downstream tasks. More specifically, we train autoencoders on synthetic images and find that a single matrix can explain how their activations transform as the images are rotated. Building on this, we develop adaptively equivariant SAEs that can adapt to the base model's level of equivariance. These adaptive SAEs discover features that lead to superior probing performance compared to regular SAEs, demonstrating the value of incorporating symmetries in mechanistic interpretability tools.

Abstract: We propose a method that uses large language models to assist graph machine learning under personalization and privacy constraints. The approach combines data augmentation for sparse graphs, prompt and instruction tuning to adapt foundation models to graph tasks, and in-context learning to supply few-shot graph reasoning signals. These signals parameterize a Dynamic UMAP manifold of client-specific graph embeddings inside a Bayesian variational objective for personalized federated learning. The method supports node classification and link prediction in low-resource settings and aligns language model latent representations with graph structure via a cross-modal regularizer. We outline a convergence argument for the variational aggregation procedure, describe a differential privacy threat model based on a moments accountant, and present applications to knowledge graph completion, recommendation-style link prediction, and citation and product graphs. We also discuss evaluation considerations for benchmarking LLM-assisted graph machine learning.

Abstract: With rapid urbanization in recent decades, traffic congestion has intensified due to increased movement of people and goods. As planning shifts from demand-based to supply-oriented strategies, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have become essential for managing traffic within existing infrastructure. A core ITS function is traffic forecasting, enabling proactive measures like ramp metering, signal control, and dynamic routing through platforms such as Google Maps. This study assesses the performance of statistical, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) models in forecasting traffic speed and flow using real-world data from California's Harbor Freeway, sourced from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). Each model was evaluated over 20 forecasting windows (up to 1 hour 40 minutes) using RMSE, MAE, and R-Square metrics. Results show ANFIS-GP performs best at early windows with RMSE of 0.038, MAE of 0.0276, and R-Square of 0.9983, while Bi-LSTM is more robust for medium-term prediction due to its capacity to model long-range temporal dependencies, achieving RMSE of 0.1863, MAE of 0.0833, and R-Square of 0.987 at a forecasting of 20. The degradation in model performance was quantified using logarithmic transformation, with slope values used to measure robustness. Among DL models, Bi-LSTM had the flattest slope (0.0454 RMSE, 0.0545 MAE for flow), whereas ANFIS-GP had 0.1058 for RMSE and 0.1037 for flow MAE. The study concludes by identifying hybrid models as a promising future direction.

Conclusion: 所提出的框架不仅提高了SEP预测模型的可解释性，还帮助太阳物理学家更好地理解事件背后的物理成因。

Abstract: Solar energetic particle (SEP) events, as one of the most prominent manifestations of solar activity, can generate severe hazardous radiation when accelerated by solar flares or shock waves formed aside from coronal mass ejections (CMEs). However, most existing data-driven methods used for SEP predictions are operated as black-box models, making it challenging for solar physicists to interpret the results and understand the underlying physical causes of such events rather than just obtain a prediction. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that integrates global explanations and ad-hoc feature mapping to enhance model transparency and provide deeper insights into the decision-making process. We validate our approach using a dataset of 341 SEP events, including 244 significant (>=10 MeV) proton events exceeding the Space Weather Prediction Center S1 threshold, spanning solar cycles 22, 23, and 24. Furthermore, we present an explainability-focused case study of major SEP events, demonstrating how our method improves explainability and facilitates a more physics-informed understanding of SEP event prediction.

Motivation: 探索在高维决策空间中是否可以直接在与评估对齐的嵌入空间中进行规划，而非依赖策略或价值网络训练。

Method: 使用监督对比学习（supervised contrastive learning）构建嵌入空间，其中结果相似性由距离表示，并通过一个全局优势向量引导空间方向，候选动作根据其与此向量的对齐程度排序。

Result: 在国际象棋任务中，SOLIS仅通过浅层搜索和学习到的嵌入即可在受限条件下达到有竞争力的水平。

Conclusion: 评估对齐的潜在空间规划提供了一种无需传统动态模型或策略学习的轻量级规划替代方案。

Abstract: Planning in high-dimensional decision spaces is increasingly being studied through the lens of learned representations. Rather than training policies or value heads, we investigate whether planning can be carried out directly in an evaluation-aligned embedding space. We introduce SOLIS, which learns such a space using supervised contrastive learning. In this representation, outcome similarity is captured by proximity, and a single global advantage vector orients the space from losing to winning regions. Candidate actions are then ranked according to their alignment with this direction, reducing planning to vector operations in latent space. We demonstrate this approach in chess, where SOLIS uses only a shallow search guided by the learned embedding to reach competitive strength under constrained conditions. More broadly, our results suggest that evaluation-aligned latent planning offers a lightweight alternative to traditional dynamics models or policy learning.

Abstract: Rehearsal-based Continual Learning (CL) maintains a limited memory buffer to store replay samples for knowledge retention, making these approaches heavily reliant on the quality of the stored samples. Current Rehearsal-based CL methods typically construct the memory buffer by selecting a representative subset (referred to as coresets), aiming to approximate the training efficacy of the full dataset with minimal storage overhead. However, mainstream Coreset Selection (CS) methods generally formulate the CS problem as a bi-level optimization problem that relies on numerous inner and outer iterations to solve, leading to substantial computational cost thus limiting their practical efficiency. In this paper, we aim to provide a more efficient selection logic and scheme for coreset construction. To this end, we first analyze the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the buffer-trained model and the Bayes-optimal model through the perspective of localized error decomposition to investigate the contribution of samples from different regions to MSE suppression. Further theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that samples with high probability density play a dominant role in error suppression. Inspired by this, we propose the Probability Density-Aware Coreset (PDAC) method. PDAC leverages the Projected Gaussian Mixture (PGM) model to estimate each sample's joint density, enabling efficient density-prioritized buffer selection. Finally, we introduce the streaming Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to enhance the adaptability of PGM parameters to streaming data, yielding Streaming PDAC (SPDAC) for streaming scenarios. Extensive comparative experiments show that our methods outperforms other baselines across various CL settings while ensuring favorable efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoSynth是一种无需参考数据集的自动化合成数据生成框架，通过蒙特卡洛树搜索和基于大语言模型评判的混合奖励机制，解决了主观开放任务中监督微调数据构建的冷启动问题，在教育类任务中显著优于基线方法，同时将人工投入从5-7小时减少到30分钟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调需要高质量数据，但人工标注成本高，而现有合成数据方法依赖标注数据进行奖励建模，难以应用于无客观标准的主观开放任务，存在冷启动问题。

Method: 提出AutoSynth框架，将工作流优化问题转化为蒙特卡洛树搜索问题，设计无数据依赖的混合奖励机制，利用两个大语言模型作为评判器：一个动态生成任务特定指标评估样本质量，另一个评估工作流代码与提示质量，实现元学习。

Result: 在主观教育任务实验中，尽管专家设计工作流的人类偏好胜率更高（96-99% vs. 40-51%），但使用AutoSynth生成数据训练的模型显著优于基线（40-51% vs. 2-5%），并在某些指标上媲美或超过专家方案，且人工时间从5-7小时降至30分钟。

Conclusion: AutoSynth有效解决了数据中心化AI中的冷启动问题，为大语言模型在主观任务上的高效、低成本微调提供了可扩展的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models (LLMs) for specialized tasks requires high-quality datasets, but manual curation is prohibitively expensive. Synthetic data generation offers scalability, but its effectiveness relies on complex, multi-stage workflows, integrating prompt engineering and model orchestration. Existing automated workflow methods face a cold start problem: they require labeled datasets for reward modeling, which is especially problematic for subjective, open-ended tasks with no objective ground truth. We introduce AutoSynth, a framework that automates workflow discovery and optimization without reference datasets by reframing the problem as a Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by a novel dataset-free hybrid reward. This reward enables meta-learning through two LLM-as-judge components: one evaluates sample quality using dynamically generated task-specific metrics, and another assesses workflow code and prompt quality. Experiments on subjective educational tasks show that while expert-designed workflows achieve higher human preference rates (96-99% win rates vs. AutoSynth's 40-51%), models trained on AutoSynth-generated data dramatically outperform baselines (40-51% vs. 2-5%) and match or surpass expert workflows on certain metrics, suggesting discovery of quality dimensions beyond human intuition. These results are achieved while reducing human effort from 5-7 hours to just 30 minutes (>90% reduction). AutoSynth tackles the cold start issue in data-centric AI, offering a scalable, cost-effective method for subjective LLM tasks. Code: https://github.com/bisz9918-maker/AutoSynth.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于二阶信息的确定性策略梯度框架，通过引入二次型评论家函数和拟牛顿更新，提升强化学习中确定性策略的收敛速度与性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了克服传统确定性策略梯度方法仅使用一阶梯度信息导致收敛慢的问题，本文旨在利用性能函数的曲率（二阶）信息来加速优化过程。

Method: 提出一种二阶确定性Actor-Critic框架，引入二次型评论家函数，在保持真实策略梯度的同时近似性能函数的Hessian矩阵，并设计最小二乘时序差分方法高效估计其参数，从而实现Actor的拟牛顿更新。

Result: 该方法在数值实验中相比标准的确定性Actor-Critic方法表现出更快的收敛速度和更好的性能，验证了利用二阶信息的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架成功将二阶优化思想引入确定性策略梯度方法，具有广泛适用性，可应用于任何可微策略类，显著提升了学习效率。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a second-order deterministic actor-critic framework in reinforcement learning that extends the classical deterministic policy gradient method to exploit curvature information of the performance function. Building on the concept of compatible function approximation for the critic, we introduce a quadratic critic that simultaneously preserves the true policy gradient and an approximation of the performance Hessian. A least-squares temporal difference learning scheme is then developed to estimate the quadratic critic parameters efficiently. This construction enables a quasi-Newton actor update using information learned by the critic, yielding faster convergence compared to first-order methods. The proposed approach is general and applicable to any differentiable policy class. Numerical examples demonstrate that the method achieves improved convergence and performance over standard deterministic actor-critic baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了GenePheno，首个从基因序列直接预测基因敲除诱导的多表型异常的可解释多标签预测框架，通过对比学习和生物学一致性正则化，在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖于人工整理的遗传信息，难以扩展且泛化能力有限，无法广泛地从基因序列直接预测多种表型异常。

Method: 提出GenePheno框架，采用对比多标签学习目标捕捉表型间相关性，引入排他性正则化增强生物学一致性，并设计基因功能瓶颈层以提供可解释的功能机制。

Result: 在四个新构建的数据集上，GenePheno在基因中心Fmax和表型中心AUC指标上达到SOTA水平，案例研究显示其能揭示基因功能机制。

Conclusion: GenePheno为从基因序列预测表型异常提供了可扩展、可解释的新范式，推动了基因功能与表型关系的假设驱动研究。

Abstract: Exploring how genetic sequences shape phenotypes is a fundamental challenge in biology and a key step toward scalable, hypothesis-driven experimentation. The task is complicated by the large modality gap between sequences and phenotypes, as well as the pleiotropic nature of gene-phenotype relationships. Existing sequence-based efforts focus on the degree to which variants of specific genes alter a limited set of phenotypes, while general gene knockout induced phenotype abnormality prediction methods heavily rely on curated genetic information as inputs, which limits scalability and generalizability. As a result, the task of broadly predicting the presence of multiple phenotype abnormalities under gene knockout directly from gene sequences remains underexplored. We introduce GenePheno, the first interpretable multi-label prediction framework that predicts knockout induced phenotypic abnormalities from gene sequences. GenePheno employs a contrastive multi-label learning objective that captures inter-phenotype correlations, complemented by an exclusive regularization that enforces biological consistency. It further incorporates a gene function bottleneck layer, offering human interpretable concepts that reflect functional mechanisms behind phenotype formation. To support progress in this area, we curate four datasets with canonical gene sequences as input and multi-label phenotypic abnormalities induced by gene knockouts as targets. Across these datasets, GenePheno achieves state-of-the-art gene-centric Fmax and phenotype-centric AUC, and case studies demonstrate its ability to reveal gene functional mechanisms.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于数字时域计算的Tsetlin机器推理方法，通过延迟累积机制和胜者为王策略，显著提升了能效和吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习模型在推理过程中需要大量算术运算，导致高延迟和高功耗，因此需要更高效的计算方法。

Method: 采用数字时域计算，利用延迟累积机制替代类别的算术求和，并使用胜者为王方案取代传统幅度比较器；针对多类Tset林机实现汉明距离驱动的时域方案，并结合差分延迟路径与前导1检测器的对数压缩时域方案用于合并的TMs。

Result: 与等效的数字TM架构基线相比，所提架构在能效和吞吐量上实现了数量级的提升。

Conclusion: 该方法有效降低了Tsetlin机器推理过程中的计算开销，为低功耗、高性能边缘计算提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Machine learning fits model parameters to approximate input-output mappings, predicting unknown samples. However, these models often require extensive arithmetic computations during inference, increasing latency and power consumption. This paper proposes a digital-time-domain computing approach for Tsetlin machine (TM) inference process to address these challenges. This approach leverages a delay accumulation mechanism to mitigate the costly arithmetic sums of classes and employs a Winner-Takes-All scheme to replace conventional magnitude comparators. Specifically, a Hamming distance-driven time-domain scheme is implemented for multi-class TMs. Furthermore, differential delay paths, combined with a leading-ones-detector logarithmic delay compression digital-time-domain scheme, are utilised for the coalesced TMs, accommodating both binary-signed and exponential-scale delay accumulation issues. Compared to the functionally equivalent, post-implementation digital TM architecture baseline, the proposed architecture demonstrates orders-of-magnitude improvements in energy efficiency and throughput.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在忽略结构上下文或依赖高成本计算之间权衡，难以兼顾化学有效性与蛋白质结合口袋的结构兼容性，限制了计算药物发现的通量和可扩展性。

Method: 提出SiDGen，采用蛋白条件扩散框架，结合掩码SMILES生成与轻量折叠特征；支持两种条件路径：简化模式聚合粗粒度结构信号，完整模式注入局部成对偏置以增强耦合；引入粗步长折叠机制与最近邻上采样降低内存开销，并通过循环内化学有效性检查、无效性惩罚及选择性编译等策略提升训练稳定性与效率。

Conclusion: SiDGen能够在保证化学合理性的同时实现可扩展的口袋感知分子生成，为高通量药物发现提供了实用的条件生成路径。

Abstract: Designing ligands that are both chemically valid and structurally compatible with protein binding pockets is a key bottleneck in computational drug discovery. Existing approaches either ignore structural context or rely on expensive, memory-intensive encoding that limits throughput and scalability. We present SiDGen (Structure-informed Diffusion Generator), a protein-conditioned diffusion framework that integrates masked SMILES generation with lightweight folding-derived features for pocket awareness. To balance expressivity with efficiency, SiDGen supports two conditioning pathways: a streamlined mode that pools coarse structural signals from protein embeddings and a full mode that injects localized pairwise biases for stronger coupling. A coarse-stride folding mechanism with nearest-neighbor upsampling alleviates the quadratic memory costs of pair tensors, enabling training on realistic sequence lengths. Learning stability is maintained through in-loop chemical validity checks and an invalidity penalty, while large-scale training efficiency is restored \textit{via} selective compilation, dataloader tuning, and gradient accumulation. In automated benchmarks, SiDGen generates ligands with high validity, uniqueness, and novelty, while achieving competitive performance in docking-based evaluations and maintaining reasonable molecular properties. These results demonstrate that SiDGen can deliver scalable, pocket-aware molecular design, providing a practical route to conditional generation for high-throughput drug discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为NSL-MT的训练方法，通过在损失函数中引入语言学约束的惩罚项来教模型避免生成不合法的输出，显著提升翻译性能和数据效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在平行语料有限的情况下，传统神经机器翻译模型难以充分学习目标语言的语法结构，需要更高效的数据利用方法。

Method: 将语言学约束编码为损失函数中的严重性加权惩罚项，并使用合成生成的语法错误样本增强训练数据，显式惩罚模型对非法输出的高概率预测。

Result: 在各类模型架构上均取得显著提升：高性能模型获得3-12%的BLEU分数提升，初始表现差的模型提升达56-89%；同时实现约5倍的数据效率提升。

Conclusion: NSL-MT是一种高效利用有限平行语料的训练方法，通过‘负空间学习’显著提升模型性能，尤其适用于低资源翻译场景。

Abstract: We introduce Negative Space Learning MT (NSL-MT), a training method that teaches models what not to generate by encoding linguistic constraints as severity-weighted penalties in the loss function. NSL-MT increases limited parallel data with synthetically generated violations of target language grammar, explicitly penalizing the model when it assigns high probability to these linguistically invalid outputs. We demonstrate that NSL-MT delivers improvements across all architectures: 3-12\% BLEU gains for well-performing models and 56-89\% gains for models lacking descent initial support. Furthermore, NSL-MT provides a 5x data efficiency multiplier -- training with 1,000 examples matches or exceeds normal training with 5,000 examples. Thus, NSL-MT provides a data-efficient alternative training method for settings where there is limited annotated parallel corporas.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为GIRAM的持续性下一兴趣点推荐框架，通过结合长期和近期用户兴趣，实现对用户行为变化的动态适应，同时保持高效更新和低内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖静态数据集和固定模型，难以适应用户兴趣随时间的变化，因此需要一种能够持续学习并适应用户行为演变的推荐系统。

Method: 提出GIRAM框架，包含兴趣记忆模块、上下文感知键编码模块、生成式键检索模块和自适应兴趣融合模块，结合长期与近期兴趣，并可集成到现有POI推荐模型中。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，GIRAM在推荐性能上优于现有最先进方法，同时在更新时间和内存使用方面保持高效。

Conclusion: GIRAM是一种高效且通用的持续性下一POI推荐框架，能有效应对用户兴趣演化问题，适用于实际场景部署。

Abstract: Next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation improves personalized location-based services by predicting users' next destinations based on their historical check-ins. However, most existing methods rely on static datasets and fixed models, limiting their ability to adapt to changes in user behavior over time. To address this limitation, we explore a novel task termed continual next POI recommendation, where models dynamically adapt to evolving user interests through continual updates. This task is particularly challenging, as it requires capturing shifting user behaviors while retaining previously learned knowledge. Moreover, it is essential to ensure efficiency in update time and memory usage for real-world deployment. To this end, we propose GIRAM (Generative Key-based Interest Retrieval and Adaptive Modeling), an efficient, model-agnostic framework that integrates context-aware sustained interests with recent interests. GIRAM comprises four components: (1) an interest memory to preserve historical preferences; (2) a context-aware key encoding module for unified interest key representation; (3) a generative key-based retrieval module to identify diverse and relevant sustained interests; and (4) an adaptive interest update and fusion module to update the interest memory and balance sustained and recent interests. In particular, GIRAM can be seamlessly integrated with existing next POI recommendation models. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that GIRAM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods while maintaining high efficiency in both update time and memory consumption.

Motivation: 现有方法多将CLIP作为静态特征提取器，忽视其对神经表征的适应性，且未能有效解决EEG与图像之间的生理-符号鸿沟问题。

Method: 提出三方面创新：设计双流视觉嵌入管道生成实例级自适应提示；首次引入视觉提示令牌实现模态级全局调整；基于人脑视觉编码原理设计改进的对比损失函数。

Conclusion: 生理感知的提示调优能有效桥接脑电信号与视觉语义，为脑启发AI提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in brain-inspired artificial intelligence have sought to align neural signals with visual semantics using multimodal models such as CLIP. However, existing methods often treat CLIP as a static feature extractor, overlooking its adaptability to neural representations and the inherent physiological-symbolic gap in EEG-image alignment. To address these challenges, we present NeuroCLIP, a prompt tuning framework tailored for EEG-to-image contrastive learning. Our approach introduces three core innovations: (1) We design a dual-stream visual embedding pipeline that combines dynamic filtering and token-level fusion to generate instance-level adaptive prompts, which guide the adjustment of patch embedding tokens based on image content, thereby enabling fine-grained modulation of visual representations under neural constraints; (2) We are the first to introduce visual prompt tokens into EEG-image alignment, acting as global, modality-level prompts that work in conjunction with instance-level adjustments. These visual prompt tokens are inserted into the Transformer architecture to facilitate neural-aware adaptation and parameter optimization at a global level; (3) Inspired by neuroscientific principles of human visual encoding, we propose a refined contrastive loss that better model the semantic ambiguity and cross-modal noise present in EEG signals. On the THINGS-EEG2 dataset, NeuroCLIP achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 63.2% in zero-shot image retrieval, surpassing the previous best method by +12.3%, and demonstrates strong generalization under inter-subject conditions (+4.6% Top-1), highlighting the potential of physiology-aware prompt tuning for bridging brain signals and visual semantics.

Motivation: 由于缺乏标准化的评估指标和基准，用户模拟的验证面临挑战，难以判断模拟器是否准确反映真实用户行为。

Method: 构建了一个包含160个真实搜索会话的数据集，其中70个会话有最多62次模拟运行，分为任务A和任务B，分别预测用户的下一个查询或话语；提出新的评估指标。

Conclusion: Sim4IA-Bench为用户模拟提供了可复现的研究基础，推动了信息访问中更真实、可解释的用户模拟研究。

Abstract: Validating user simulation is a difficult task due to the lack of established measures and benchmarks, which makes it challenging to assess whether a simulator accurately reflects real user behavior. As part of the Sim4IA Micro-Shared Task at the Sim4IA Workshop, SIGIR 2025, we present Sim4IA-Bench, a simulation benchmark suit for the prediction of the next queries and utterances, the first of its kind in the IR community. Our dataset as part of the suite comprises 160 real-world search sessions from the CORE search engine. For 70 of these sessions, up to 62 simulator runs are available, divided into Task A and Task B, in which different approaches predicted users next search queries or utterances. Sim4IA-Bench provides a basis for evaluating and comparing user simulation approaches and for developing new measures of simulator validity. Although modest in size, the suite represents the first publicly available benchmark that links real search sessions with simulated next-query predictions. In addition to serving as a testbed for next query prediction, it also enables exploratory studies on query reformulation behavior, intent drift, and interaction-aware retrieval evaluation. We also introduce a new measure for evaluating next-query predictions in this task. By making the suite publicly available, we aim to promote reproducible research and stimulate further work on realistic and explainable user simulation for information access: https://github.com/irgroup/Sim4IA-Bench.

TL;DR: 本文针对生产环境中RAG系统的评估问题，提出了新的评估指标RA-nWG@K、标准化黄金集构建方法rag-gs、端到端基准测试及诊断工具，以支持可复现、符合成本与SLA约束的决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有信息检索指标（如nDCG/MAP/MRR）不适用于RAG场景，缺乏标准化黄金集构建方法、端到端基准测试以及对嵌入模型行为的透明分析。

Method: 提出RA-nWG@K评分机制和PROC/%PROC分析框架；设计基于Plackett-Luce模型的rag-gs黄金集生成流程；在科学文献语料上进行全面基准测试；通过消融实验评估命名实体识别和对话噪声敏感性。

Conclusion: 所提方法为RAG系统提供了可审计、可复现的评估框架，支持在成本、延迟和质量之间的权衡决策。

Abstract: This paper addresses the guessing game in building production RAG. Classical rank-centric IR metrics (nDCG/MAP/MRR) are a poor fit for RAG, where LLMs consume a set of passages rather than a browsed list; position discounts and prevalence-blind aggregation miss what matters: whether the prompt at cutoff K contains the decisive evidence. Second, there is no standardized, reproducible way to build and audit golden sets. Third, leaderboards exist but lack end-to-end, on-corpus benchmarking that reflects production trade-offs. Fourth, how state-of-the-art embedding models handle proper-name identity signals and conversational noise remains opaque. To address these, we contribute: (1) RA-nWG@K, a rarity-aware, per-query-normalized set score, and operational ceilings via the pool-restricted oracle ceiling (PROC) and the percentage of PROC (%PROC) to separate retrieval from ordering headroom within a Cost-Latency-Quality (CLQ) lens; (2) rag-gs (MIT), a lean golden-set pipeline with Plackett-Luce listwise refinement whose iterative updates outperform single-shot LLM ranking; (3) a comprehensive benchmark on a production RAG (scientific-papers corpus) spanning dense retrieval, hybrid dense+BM25, embedding models and dimensions, cross-encoder rerankers, ANN (HNSW), and quantization; and (4) targeted diagnostics that quantify proper-name identity signal and conversational-noise sensitivity via identity-destroying and formatting ablations. Together, these components provide practitioner Pareto guidance and auditable guardrails to support reproducible, budget/SLA-aware decisions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合大语言模型（LLM）和抽象语义表示（AMR）图的新方法，将无约束英文翻译为Answer Set Programming（ASP）程序，用于解决逻辑谜题，系统化生成ASP规则与约束，减少对LLM的依赖，提升可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 让不熟悉编程语言的用户也能通过自然语言与ASP交互，降低使用门槛，并提高现有纯LLM方法在生成ASP程序时的可解释性和可靠性。

Method: 利用LLM简化自然语言句子、识别关键词并生成简单事实；基于简化后的语言生成AMR图，再通过解析AMR图系统化构建ASP规则、事实和约束。

Result: 系统能够从无约束英文描述中完整生成可运行的ASP程序，成功解决多个逻辑谜题示例，且相比纯LLM方法更轻量、更具可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法是实现自然语言到复杂逻辑程序转换的重要一步，通过结合LLM与结构化语义表示（AMR），实现了更可靠、透明的ASP程序生成。

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a declarative programming paradigm based on logic programming and non-monotonic reasoning. It is a tremendously powerful tool for describing and solving combinatorial problems. Like any other language, ASP requires users to learn how it works and the syntax involved. It is becoming increasingly required for those unfamiliar with programming languages to interact with code. This paper proposes a novel method of translating unconstrained English into ASP programs for logic puzzles using an LLM and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs. Everything from ASP rules, facts, and constraints is generated to fully represent and solve the desired problem. Example logic puzzles are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the system. While most current methods rely entirely on an LLM, our system minimizes the role of the LLM only to complete straightforward tasks. The LLM is used to simplify natural language sentences, identify keywords, and generate simple facts. The AMR graphs are then parsed from simplified language and used to generate ASP constraints systematically. The system successfully creates an entire ASP program that solves a combinatorial logic problem. This approach is a significant first step in creating a lighter-weight, explainable system that converts natural language to solve complex logic problems.

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) is a generative, few-shot fluid intelligence benchmark. Although humans effortlessly solve ARC-AGI, it remains extremely difficult for even the most advanced artificial intelligence systems. Inspired by methods for modelling human intelligence spanning neuroscience to psychology, we propose a cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver. Our solver integrates System 1 intuitions with System 2 reasoning in an efficient and interpretable process using neurosymbolic methods based on Vector Symbolic Algebras (VSAs). Our solver works by object-centric program synthesis, leveraging VSAs to represent abstract objects, guide solution search, and enable sample-efficient neural learning. Preliminary results indicate success, with our solver scoring 10.8% on ARC-AGI-1-Train and 3.0% on ARC-AGI-1-Eval. Additionally, our solver performs well on simpler benchmarks, scoring 94.5% on Sort-of-ARC and 83.1% on 1D-ARC -- the latter outperforming GPT-4 at a tiny fraction of the computational cost. Importantly, our approach is unique; we believe we are the first to apply VSAs to ARC-AGI and have developed the most cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver yet.

TL;DR: 提出Query Conditioned Deterministic Inference Networks (QDIN)，将强化学习系统设计为可回答多种环境查询的推理引擎，揭示推理准确性与控制性能之间的解耦现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习仅关注最大化奖励，忽略了训练后模型中蕴含的丰富环境知识（如可达性、距离、值函数等）。作者希望构建能高效显式回答多样化查询的RL系统，以提升可解释性、验证能力和人机协作潜力。

Method: 提出QDIN架构，使用专门化的神经模块分别处理策略、可达性、路径、比较等不同类型的查询，将这些查询视为一等公民，并在确定性环境中进行联合训练。

Result: 实验发现推理准确率可在控制性能较差时仍接近完美（99%可达性IoU对应31%回报），表明用于知识推理和最优控制的表征不同；专用查询架构优于统一模型和事后提取方法，同时保持有竞争力的控制性能。

Conclusion: 应从一开始就将RL系统设计为可查询的知识库，QDIN为实现这一新研究方向提供了有效框架，推动RL向更具解释性和交互性的方向发展。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has traditionally focused on a singular objective: learning policies that select actions to maximize reward. We challenge this paradigm by asking: what if we explicitly architected RL systems as inference engines that can answer diverse queries about their environment? In deterministic settings, trained agents implicitly encode rich knowledge about reachability, distances, values, and dynamics - yet current architectures are not designed to expose this information efficiently. We introduce Query Conditioned Deterministic Inference Networks (QDIN), a unified architecture that treats different types of queries (policy, reachability, paths, comparisons) as first-class citizens, with specialized neural modules optimized for each inference pattern. Our key empirical finding reveals a fundamental decoupling: inference accuracy can reach near-perfect levels (99% reachability IoU) even when control performance remains suboptimal (31% return), suggesting that the representations needed for accurate world knowledge differ from those required for optimal control. Experiments demonstrate that query specialized architectures outperform both unified models and post-hoc extraction methods, while maintaining competitive control performance. This work establishes a research agenda for RL systems designed from inception as queryable knowledge bases, with implications for interpretability, verification, and human-AI collaboration.

### [259] [Neural Value Iteration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08825)
*Yang You,Ufuk Çakır,Alex Schutz,Robert Skilton,Nick Hawes*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于神经网络的POMDP值函数表示方法，称为Neural Value Iteration，可高效求解大规模POMDP问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统POMDP求解器使用α-向量进行值迭代，但由于其维度随状态数增长而急剧增加，导致在大规模问题上计算不可行。

Method: 利用值函数的分段线性凸（PWLC）性质，用一组神经网络替代传统的α-向量来表示值函数，并结合经典值迭代框架提出Neural Value Iteration算法。

Result: 该方法在极大规模POMDP上实现了接近最优的解，且计算效率显著优于现有离线求解器。

Conclusion: Neural Value Iteration通过神经网络参数化值函数，有效克服了传统方法在高维状态空间中的计算瓶颈，为大规模POMDP提供了一种可行的规划方案。

Abstract: The value function of a POMDP exhibits the piecewise-linear-convex (PWLC) property and can be represented as a finite set of hyperplanes, known as $α$-vectors. Most state-of-the-art POMDP solvers (offline planners) follow the point-based value iteration scheme, which performs Bellman backups on $α$-vectors at reachable belief points until convergence. However, since each $α$-vector is $|S|$-dimensional, these methods quickly become intractable for large-scale problems due to the prohibitive computational cost of Bellman backups. In this work, we demonstrate that the PWLC property allows a POMDP's value function to be alternatively represented as a finite set of neural networks. This insight enables a novel POMDP planning algorithm called \emph{Neural Value Iteration}, which combines the generalization capability of neural networks with the classical value iteration framework. Our approach achieves near-optimal solutions even in extremely large POMDPs that are intractable for existing offline solvers.

*Shouang Wei,Min Zhang,Xin Lin,Bo Jiang,Kun Kuang,Zhongxiang Dai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为单向认知优化（UCO）的方法，通过多轮交互式强化学习和两个协同奖励函数，提升大语言模型在教育场景中的动态教学适应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督微调方法仅学习表面教学模式，缺乏动态适应能力；现有强化学习方法无法准确判断学生是否真正理解知识，且不能实时感知学生的认知状态变化。

Method: 采用多轮交互式强化学习框架，设计了两个协同奖励函数：Progress Reward用于捕捉学生从困惑到理解的认知进展，Scaffold Reward用于识别学生的最近发展区（ZPD），动态调整教学策略。

Result: 在BigMath和MathTutorBench基准上，UCO优于所有同等规模的基线模型，性能接近先进的闭源模型。

Conclusion: UCO能有效提升LLM作为智能导师的教学质量，具备根据学生认知状态动态调整教学策略的能力，推动LLM在个性化教育中的应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are shifting from answer providers to intelligent tutors in educational settings, yet current supervised fine-tuning methods only learn surface teaching patterns without dynamic adaptation capabilities. Recent reinforcement learning approaches address this limitation but face two critical challenges. First, they evaluate teaching effectiveness solely based on whether students produce correct outputs, unable to distinguish whether students genuinely understand or echo teacher-provided answers during interaction. Second, they cannot perceive students' evolving cognitive states in real time through interactive dialogue, thus failing to adapt teaching strategies to match students' cognitive levels dynamically. We propose the Unidirectional Cognitive Optimization (UCO) method to address these challenges. UCO uses a multi-turn interactive reinforcement learning paradigm where the innovation lies in two synergistic reward functions: the Progress Reward captures students' cognitive advancement, evaluating whether students truly transition from confusion to comprehension, while the Scaffold Reward dynamically identifies each student's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), encouraging teachers to maintain productive teaching within this zone. We evaluate UCO by comparing it against 11 baseline models on BigMath and MathTutorBench benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our UCO model outperforms all models of equivalent scale and achieves performance comparable to advanced closed-source models.

TL;DR: Lumine是一个首个开放的通用智能体配方，能够在3D开放世界环境中以实时方式完成长达数小时的复杂任务，具备跨游戏零样本泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够在复杂、开放环境中长时间执行多样化任务的通用智能体，是实现真正人工智能的重要挑战。现有方法在任务长度、交互复杂性和泛化能力上存在局限，因此需要一种统一感知、推理与动作的新范式。

Method: Lumine采用基于视觉-语言模型的端到端架构，以5Hz处理原始像素输入，生成30Hz的键盘鼠标动作，并仅在必要时自适应调用推理机制，模拟人类交互模式。训练在《原神》中进行，使用自然语言指令驱动多类型任务执行。

Result: Lumine成功以接近人类效率完成《原神》蒙德地区五小时主线剧情，并能执行探索、战斗、解谜、NPC互动等多种任务；无需微调即可零样本迁移至《鸣潮》和《崩坏：星穹铁道》，分别完成100分钟任务和五小时第一章内容。

Conclusion: Lumine展示了在不同游戏世界和交互动态下的强大性能与泛化能力，标志着向开放环境中通用智能体迈出实质性一步。

Abstract: We introduce Lumine, the first open recipe for developing generalist agents capable of completing hours-long complex missions in real time within challenging 3D open-world environments. Lumine adopts a human-like interaction paradigm that unifies perception, reasoning, and action in an end-to-end manner, powered by a vision-language model. It processes raw pixels at 5 Hz to produce precise 30 Hz keyboard-mouse actions and adaptively invokes reasoning only when necessary. Trained in Genshin Impact, Lumine successfully completes the entire five-hour Mondstadt main storyline on par with human-level efficiency and follows natural language instructions to perform a broad spectrum of tasks in both 3D open-world exploration and 2D GUI manipulation across collection, combat, puzzle-solving, and NPC interaction. In addition to its in-domain performance, Lumine demonstrates strong zero-shot cross-game generalization. Without any fine-tuning, it accomplishes 100-minute missions in Wuthering Waves and the full five-hour first chapter of Honkai: Star Rail. These promising results highlight Lumine's effectiveness across distinct worlds and interaction dynamics, marking a concrete step toward generalist agents in open-ended environments.

### [262] [The Double Contingency Problem: AI Recursion and the Limits of Interspecies Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08927)
*Graham L. Bishop*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨了当前生物声学AI系统在处理动物交流时的局限性，提出AI并非中立的模式识别器，而是具有自身递归认知结构的代理，可能导致对其他物种交流系统的遮蔽或扭曲。作者基于哲学家许煜的递归性与偶然性理论，指出存在‘双重偶然性’问题，并主张将生物声学AI重新构想为不同递归认知形式之间的‘外交式接触’，从而影响模型设计、评估框架与研究方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI系统虽能高效识别跨物种声音模式，但忽视了一个根本问题：当一种递归认知（如AI）遭遇另一种递归认知（如动物交流）时，其内在处理机制可能扭曲目标系统的意义结构。因此需反思AI作为认知主体的角色及其对生物交流解释的影响。

Method: 借助哲学家Yuk Hui关于递归性与偶然性的理论框架，分析AI系统与动物通信之间的交互本质，揭示技术架构本身的认知偏见，并提出概念性转向。

Result: 提出了‘双重偶然性’问题——物种交流依赖于生态演化条件，而AI处理依赖于训练与架构条件，二者之间的张力导致理解偏差；并论证了将AI从‘模式识别工具’转变为‘认知外交者’的必要性。

Conclusion: 应将生物声学AI重新定位为不同递归认知系统间的对话媒介，强调模型设计需纳入跨认知视角，发展更具反思性的评估体系与研究方法，以实现真正意义上的跨物种理解。

Abstract: Current bioacoustic AI systems achieve impressive cross-species performance by processing animal communication through transformer architectures, foundation model paradigms, and other computational approaches. However, these approaches overlook a fundamental question: what happens when one form of recursive cognition--AI systems with their attention mechanisms, iterative processing, and feedback loops--encounters the recursive communicative processes of other species? Drawing on philosopher Yuk Hui's work on recursivity and contingency, I argue that AI systems are not neutral pattern detectors but recursive cognitive agents whose own information processing may systematically obscure or distort other species' communicative structures. This creates a double contingency problem: each species' communication emerges through contingent ecological and evolutionary conditions, while AI systems process these signals through their own contingent architectural and training conditions. I propose that addressing this challenge requires reconceptualizing bioacoustic AI from universal pattern recognition toward diplomatic encounter between different forms of recursive cognition, with implications for model design, evaluation frameworks, and research methodologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型具备良好流畅性，但在复杂推理任务中仍表现不足，因此需要系统性框架来提升其推理能力。

Method: 构建基于美国开国元勋历史人设的多智能体系统，对比简单线性流程与引入递归精炼机制的复杂结构化流程，采用LLM仲裁评分与人工评估结合的方式评价模型输出。

Result: 复杂递归精炼模型在九项测试中均优于简单模型，平均得分为88.3 vs 71.7，论证更具分析深度、结构细腻性和战略框架性。

Conclusion: 递归精炼是一种有效的架构设计，能够通过受控的渐进式搜索显著提升大语言模型的推理性能。

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional fluency, efforts persist to extract stronger reasoning capabilities from them. Drawing on search-based interpretations of LLM computation, this paper advances a systematic framework for understanding LLM reasoning and optimization. Namely, that enhancing reasoning is best achieved by structuring a multi-agent pipeline to ensure a traversal of the search space in a gradual, incremental, and sequential (GIS) manner. Stated succinctly, high-quality reasoning is a controlled, incremental search. To test this framework, we investigate the efficacy of recursive refinement (RR)--an iterative process of self-criticism, adversarial stress-testing, and integrating critical feedback--as a practical method for implementing GIS search. We designed an experiment comparing a simple, linear pipeline against a complex, explicitly structured pipeline leveraging a recursive refinement layer. The multi-agent models were constructed to reflect the historical personas of three US Founding Fathers (Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison) using RAG-powered corpora and were prompted to generate responses to three contemporary political issues. Model performance was evaluated using a two-tiered approach: a quantitative score from an LLM arbiter agent and qualitative human judgment. Our results revealed that the complex model consistently outperformed the simple model across all nine test cases with an average arbiter-outputted score of 88.3 versus 71.7. The complex model's arguments were superior in analytical depth, structural nuance, and strategic framing. We conclude that recursive refinement is a robust architectural feature for enhancing LLM reasoning via GIS search.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型在长程推理任务中存在持续性错误，难以扩展到人类、组织和社会规模的复杂任务，亟需一种可扩展且可靠的解决方案。

Method: 将任务极端分解为多个子任务，由专注的微型智能体处理，并通过高效的多智能体投票机制在每一步进行错误纠正，实现高模块化和可扩展性。

Result: MAKER系统成功完成了超过一百万步的LLM任务且无任何错误，显著超越了现有模型在长程任务中的表现极限。

Conclusion: 大规模分解代理过程（MDAPs）结合错误纠正机制，为实现组织和社会规模的复杂问题解决提供了可行路径，可能成为超越单纯模型改进的新范式。

Abstract: LLMs have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in reasoning, insights, and tool use, but chaining these abilities into extended processes at the scale of those routinely executed by humans, organizations, and societies has remained out of reach. The models have a persistent error rate that prevents scale-up: for instance, recent experiments in the Towers of Hanoi benchmark domain showed that the process inevitably becomes derailed after at most a few hundred steps. Thus, although LLM research is often still benchmarked on tasks with relatively few dependent logical steps, there is increasing attention on the ability (or inability) of LLMs to perform long range tasks. This paper describes MAKER, the first system that successfully solves a task with over one million LLM steps with zero errors, and, in principle, scales far beyond this level. The approach relies on an extreme decomposition of a task into subtasks, each of which can be tackled by focused microagents. The high level of modularity resulting from the decomposition allows error correction to be applied at each step through an efficient multi-agent voting scheme. This combination of extreme decomposition and error correction makes scaling possible. Thus, the results suggest that instead of relying on continual improvement of current LLMs, massively decomposed agentic processes (MDAPs) may provide a way to efficiently solve problems at the level of organizations and societies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出AlphaCast，一个结合人类智慧与大语言模型的交互式时间序列预测框架，通过两阶段协同推理提升预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列预测方法多为静态单次映射，缺乏人类专家的交互性、推理能力和适应性，限制了在复杂现实场景中的应用。

Method: 设计AlphaCast框架，包含两个阶段：(1) 自动化预测准备，构建多源认知基础，包括特征集、领域知识库、上下文仓库和案例库；(2) 生成式推理与反思优化，整合统计特征、先验知识和上下文信息，触发元推理循环实现自我修正与策略优化。

Result: 在短期和长期时间序列数据集上的实验表明，AlphaCast在预测精度上持续优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: AlphaCast通过人机协同推理机制，有效提升了时间序列预测的准确性和适应性，适用于能源、医疗和气候等高风险领域。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in high-stakes domains such as energy, healthcare, and climate. Although recent advances have improved accuracy, most approaches still treat forecasting as a static one-time mapping task, lacking the interaction, reasoning, and adaptability of human experts. This gap limits their usefulness in complex real-world environments. To address this, we propose AlphaCast, a human wisdom-large language model (LLM) intelligence co-reasoning framework that redefines forecasting as an interactive process. The key idea is to enable step-by-step collaboration between human wisdom and LLM intelligence to jointly prepare, generate, and verify forecasts. The framework consists of two stages: (1) automated prediction preparation, where AlphaCast builds a multi-source cognitive foundation comprising a feature set that captures key statistics and time patterns, a domain knowledge base distilled from corpora and historical series, a contextual repository that stores rich information for each time window, and a case base that retrieves optimal strategies via pattern clustering and matching; and (2) generative reasoning and reflective optimization, where AlphaCast integrates statistical temporal features, prior knowledge, contextual information, and forecasting strategies, triggering a meta-reasoning loop for continuous self-correction and strategy refinement. Extensive experiments on short- and long-term datasets show that AlphaCast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.

Motivation: 由于在稳定语义下，大规模假设型论证（ABA）框架的精确扩展计算是难处理的，因此需要一种高效的近似方法来提升可扩展性。

Method: 将ABA框架建模为编码假设、结论和规则的依赖图，使用异质边标签区分支持、推导和攻击关系；提出ABAGCN和ABAGAT两种GNN架构，分别采用残差异质卷积层和注意力层学习节点嵌入，并在ICCMA 2023数据集及合成数据上训练，结合贝叶斯超参数优化。

Conclusion: 该工作展示了GNN在结构化论证中的有效性，提供了一种可扩展的近似推理方法，为未来研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Assumption-Based Argumentation (ABA) is a powerful structured argumentation formalism, but exact computation of extensions under stable semantics is intractable for large frameworks. We present the first Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach to approximate credulous acceptance in ABA. To leverage GNNs, we model ABA frameworks via a dependency graph representation encoding assumptions, claims and rules as nodes, with heterogeneous edge labels distinguishing support, derive and attack relations. We propose two GNN architectures - ABAGCN and ABAGAT - that stack residual heterogeneous convolution or attention layers, respectively, to learn node embeddings. Our models are trained on the ICCMA 2023 benchmark, augmented with synthetic ABAFs, with hyperparameters optimised via Bayesian search. Empirically, both ABAGCN and ABAGAT outperform a state-of-the-art GNN baseline that we adapt from the abstract argumentation literature, achieving a node-level F1 score of up to 0.71 on the ICCMA instances. Finally, we develop a sound polynomial time extension-reconstruction algorithm driven by our predictor: it reconstructs stable extensions with F1 above 0.85 on small ABAFs and maintains an F1 of about 0.58 on large frameworks. Our work opens new avenues for scalable approximate reasoning in structured argumentation.

Motivation: 自动驾驶系统在实际道路中面临多种驾驶风险，影响安全性和性能，亟需提升其运行时的韧性以应对潜在安全隐患。

Method: 设计并实现了一个名为Argus的运行时框架，该框架持续监控ADS生成的轨迹，在检测到安全隐患时通过风险缓解器无缝接管控制权，并集成到三种先进的端到端ADS（TCP、UniAD、VAD）中进行验证。

Conclusion: Argus显著增强了端到端自动驾驶系统的运行时韧性，在不显著增加开销的前提下，有效提升了系统安全性和驾驶性能，具有良好的实用价值。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems (ADSs), with their strong capabilities in environmental perception and generalizable driving decisions, are attracting growing attention from both academia and industry. However, once deployed on public roads, ADSs are inevitably exposed to diverse driving hazards that may compromise safety and degrade system performance. This raises a strong demand for resilience of ADSs, particularly the capability to continuously monitor driving hazards and adaptively respond to potential safety violations, which is crucial for maintaining robust driving behaviors in complex driving scenarios.
  To bridge this gap, we propose a runtime resilience-oriented framework, Argus, to mitigate the driving hazards, thus preventing potential safety violations and improving the driving performance of an ADS. Argus continuously monitors the trajectories generated by the ADS for potential hazards and, whenever the EGO vehicle is deemed unsafe, seamlessly takes control through a hazard mitigator. We integrate Argus with three state-of-the-art end-to-end ADSs, i.e., TCP, UniAD and VAD. Our evaluation has demonstrated that Argus effectively and efficiently enhances the resilience of ADSs, improving the driving score of the ADS by up to 150.30% on average, and preventing up to 64.38% of the violations, with little additional time overhead.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are poised to revolutionize emergency services by enabling faster, safer, and more efficient responses. This transformation is driven by advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Reinforcement Learning (RL), which allows AVs to navigate complex environments and make critical decisions in real time. However, conventional RL paradigms often suffer from poor sample efficiency and lack adaptability in dynamic emergency scenarios. This paper reviews next-generation AV optimization strategies to address these limitations. We analyze the shift from conventional RL to Diffusion Model (DM)-augmented RL, which enhances policy robustness through synthetic data generation, albeit with increased computational cost. Additionally, we explore the emerging paradigm of Large Language Model (LLM)-assisted In-Context Learning (ICL), which offers a lightweight and interpretable alternative by enabling rapid, on-the-fly adaptation without retraining. By reviewing the state of the art in AV intelligence, DM-augmented RL, and LLM-assisted ICL, this paper provides a critical framework for understanding the next generation of autonomous emergency response systems from a Generative AI perspective.

TL;DR: 本文提出了OR-R1，一种数据高效的自动化优化建模与求解框架，结合监督微调和测试时策略优化，在少量数据下显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将自然语言问题转化为优化模型依赖专家知识，现有基于大模型的方法需要大量标注或合成数据，成本高、可扩展性差。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：先通过监督微调（SFT）从有限标注数据中学习建模与代码生成；再利用测试时组相对策略优化（TGRPO）提升推理能力与一致性。

Result: OR-R1仅用十分之一的合成数据即达到67.7%的平均求解准确率，比ORLM高出4.2%；仅用100个样本时仍领先2.4%；TGRPO带来额外3.1%-6.4%的提升，并将Pass@1与Pass@8的差距从13%缩小到7%。

Conclusion: OR-R1在低数据成本下实现了最先进的自动化优化建模性能，有效降低了工业场景中运筹学应用的专业门槛和数据需求。

Abstract: Optimization modeling and solving are fundamental to the application of Operations Research (OR) in real-world decision making, yet the process of translating natural language problem descriptions into formal models and solver code remains highly expertise intensive. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new opportunities for automation, the generalization ability and data efficiency of existing LLM-based methods are still limited, asmost require vast amounts of annotated or synthetic data, resulting in high costs and scalability barriers. In this work, we present OR-R1, a data-efficient training framework for automated optimization modeling and solving. OR-R1 first employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to help the model acquire the essential reasoning patterns for problem formulation and code generation from limited labeled data. In addition, it improves the capability and consistency through Test-Time Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO). This two-stage design enables OR-R1 to leverage both scarce labeled and abundant unlabeled data for effective learning. Experiments show that OR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average solving accuracy of $67.7\%$, using only $1/10$ the synthetic data required by prior methods such as ORLM, exceeding ORLM's solving accuracy by up to $4.2\%$. Remarkably, OR-R1 outperforms ORLM by over $2.4\%$ with just $100$ synthetic samples. Furthermore, TGRPO contributes an additional $3.1\%-6.4\%$ improvement in accuracy, significantly narrowing the gap between single-attempt (Pass@1) and multi-attempt (Pass@8) performance from $13\%$ to $7\%$. Extensive evaluations across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that OR-R1 provides a robust, scalable, and cost-effective solution for automated OR optimization problem modeling and solving, lowering the expertise and data barriers for industrial OR applications.

Motivation: 现有GUI代理在处理长周期任务时缺乏对历史交互的记忆，导致推理能力不足，难以将用户简短指令转化为复杂操作。因此，需要一种能够有效利用历史信息的推理机制来提升任务执行效果。

Method: 提出HAR框架，包含构建反思学习场景、生成定制化纠正指南以及设计混合强化学习奖励函数；基于此开发了端到端模型HAR-GUI-3B，使代理具备历史感知的推理能力。

Result: 在多个GUI基准测试中，HAR-GUI-3B展现出优于现有方法的性能，验证了HAR框架在提升推理连贯性、短期记忆和细节感知方面的有效性与泛化能力。

Conclusion: HAR框架成功将GUI代理的推理模式从无视历史转变为历史感知，增强了其在复杂、长周期GUI任务中的稳定性和可靠性，为多模态大模型驱动的GUI自动化提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Advances in Multimodal Large Language Models have significantly enhanced Graphical User Interface (GUI) automation. Equipping GUI agents with reliable episodic reasoning capabilities is essential for bridging the gap between users' concise task descriptions and the complexities of real-world execution. Current methods integrate Reinforcement Learning (RL) with System-2 Chain-of-Thought, yielding notable gains in reasoning enhancement. For long-horizon GUI tasks, historical interactions connect each screen to the goal-oriented episode chain, and effectively leveraging these clues is crucial for the current decision. However, existing native GUI agents exhibit weak short-term memory in their explicit reasoning, interpreting the chained interactions as discrete screen understanding, i.e., unawareness of the historical interactions within the episode. This history-agnostic reasoning challenges their performance in GUI automation. To alleviate this weakness, we propose a History-Aware Reasoning (HAR) framework, which encourages an agent to reflect on its own errors and acquire episodic reasoning knowledge from them via tailored strategies that enhance short-term memory in long-horizon interaction. The framework mainly comprises constructing a reflective learning scenario, synthesizing tailored correction guidelines, and designing a hybrid RL reward function. Using the HAR framework, we develop a native end-to-end model, HAR-GUI-3B, which alters the inherent reasoning mode from history-agnostic to history-aware, equipping the GUI agent with stable short-term memory and reliable perception of screen details. Comprehensive evaluations across a range of GUI-related benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method.

*Leyang Yang,Ziwei Wang,Xiaoxuan Tang,Sheng Zhou,Dajun Chen,Wei Jiang,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了ProBench，一个包含200多个挑战性GUI任务的综合性移动基准，首次引入过程相关任务评估，并通过Process Provider自动提供准确的过程信息，以更精确地评估GUI代理在真实场景中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理评估主要依赖最终界面状态判断任务完成情况，忽略了多步骤操作中的关键中间过程信息，难以全面反映代理的真实能力，因此需要一种能准确捕捉和评估操作过程的新方法。

Method: 构建了一个涵盖广泛使用场景的大规模移动GUI基准ProBench，保留传统的状态相关任务评估，新增过程相关任务及其专用评估方法，并设计了Process Provider组件来自动生成准确的操作过程信息用于评估。

Result: 对先进GUI代理的评估揭示了它们在真实GUI场景中存在显著局限性，这些问题普遍存在于大规模通用模型和小型专用模型中；错误分析发现了若干共性问题。

Conclusion: ProBench能够更全面、精确地评估GUI代理的性能，当前GUI代理在复杂真实场景中仍有明显不足，研究为未来改进提供了明确方向。

Abstract: With the deep integration of artificial intelligence and interactive technology, Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agent, as the carrier connecting goal-oriented natural language and real-world devices, has received widespread attention from the community. Contemporary benchmarks aim to evaluate the comprehensive capabilities of GUI agents in GUI operation tasks, generally determining task completion solely by inspecting the final screen state. However, GUI operation tasks consist of multiple chained steps while not all critical information is presented in the final few pages. Although a few research has begun to incorporate intermediate steps into evaluation, accurately and automatically capturing this process information still remains an open challenge. To address this weakness, we introduce ProBench, a comprehensive mobile benchmark with over 200 challenging GUI tasks covering widely-used scenarios. Remaining the traditional State-related Task evaluation, we extend our dataset to include Process-related Task and design a specialized evaluation method. A newly introduced Process Provider automatically supplies accurate process information, enabling presice assessment of agent's performance. Our evaluation of advanced GUI agents reveals significant limitations for real-world GUI scenarios. These shortcomings are prevalent across diverse models, including both large-scale generalist models and smaller, GUI-specific models. A detailed error analysis further exposes several universal problems, outlining concrete directions for future improvements.

Motivation: 现有方法在减少大语言模型推理过程中冗余思维步骤时存在长度崩溃和训练崩溃问题，导致性能下降。

Method: 设计了一个训练简洁性奖励模型（CRM）的流程，并提出一种新的简洁性奖励函数（CRF），将结果奖励与简洁性评分显式关联。

Conclusion: 所提出的CRF方法从理论和实践上均优于传统长度惩罚方法，有效平衡了推理质量与效率，推动了高效大推理模型的发展。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling the development of large reasoning models (LRMs). However, LRMs such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 often generate verbose responses containing redundant or irrelevant reasoning step-a phenomenon known as overthinking-which substantially increases computational costs. Prior efforts to mitigate this issue commonly incorporate length penalties into the reward function, but we find they frequently suffer from two critical issues: length collapse and training collapse, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address them, we propose a pipeline for training a Conciseness Reward Model (CRM) that scores the conciseness of reasoning path. Additionally, we introduce a novel reward formulation named Conciseness Reward Function (CRF) with explicit dependency between the outcome reward and conciseness score, thereby fostering both more effective and more efficient reasoning. From a theoretical standpoint, we demonstrate the superiority of the new reward from the perspective of variance reduction and improved convergence properties. Besides, on the practical side, extensive experiments on five mathematical benchmark datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness and token efficiency, which achieves an 8.1% accuracy improvement and a 19.9% reduction in response token length on Qwen2.5-7B. Furthermore, the method generalizes well to other LLMs including Llama and Mistral. The implementation code and datasets are publicly available for reproduction: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CRM.

Motivation: 代理型AI系统虽然具有自主实现目标的潜力，但其运行中的不可靠性使其难以应用于医疗、工业等高风险领域，亟需解决其可靠性挑战。

Method: 基于代理型AI系统的特性，分析其运行中的主要可靠性挑战，并借鉴传统AI系统，提出包含分布外检测层和AI透明性层的双层监控框架。

Result: 提出了一个双层可靠性监控框架，能够检测新颖输入并揭示AI内部操作，为人类操作员提供决策支持，判断输出是否可靠并及时干预。

Conclusion: 该框架为降低代理型AI系统在运行中的可靠性风险提供了基础，有助于未来开发更安全的AI系统。

Abstract: The implementation of agentic AI systems has the potential of providing more helpful AI systems in a variety of applications. These systems work autonomously towards a defined goal with reduced external control. Despite their potential, one of their flaws is the insufficient reliability which makes them especially unsuitable for high-risk domains such as healthcare or process industry. Unreliable systems pose a risk in terms of unexpected behavior during operation and mitigation techniques are needed. In this work, we derive the main reliability challenges of agentic AI systems during operation based on their characteristics. We draw the connection to traditional AI systems and formulate a fundamental reliability challenge during operation which is inherent to traditional and agentic AI systems. As our main contribution, we propose a two-layered reliability monitoring framework for agentic AI systems which consists of a out-of-distribution detection layer for novel inputs and AI transparency layer to reveal internal operations. This two-layered monitoring approach gives a human operator the decision support which is needed to decide whether an output is potential unreliable or not and intervene. This framework provides a foundation for developing mitigation techniques to reduce risk stemming from uncertain reliability during operation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出MedFuse框架，利用乘性融合模块（MuFuse）建模不规则临床时间序列，有效捕捉特征间高阶依赖，在多个真实数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有临床时间序列嵌入方法多采用加性融合特征与数值信息，难以捕捉值相关的特征交互，限制了对不规则EHR数据的建模能力。

Method: 设计MuFuse模块，通过乘性调制融合特征和数值嵌入，保留特征特异性信息并建模跨特征的高阶依赖，适用于不规则采样、缺失值多的临床时间序列。

Result: 在三个真实世界医疗数据集上实验表明，MedFuse在关键预测任务中持续优于当前最优模型，且学习到的表示更具表达力，支持跨数据集预训练。

Conclusion: MedFuse通过乘性融合机制为不规则临床时间序列提供了一种可泛化的建模方法，具有较强的表达能力和应用潜力。

Abstract: Clinical time series derived from electronic health records (EHRs) are inherently irregular, with asynchronous sampling, missing values, and heterogeneous feature dynamics. While numerical laboratory measurements are highly informative, existing embedding strategies usually combine feature identity and value embeddings through additive operations, which constrains their ability to capture value-dependent feature interactions. We propose MedFuse, a framework for irregular clinical time series centered on the MuFuse (Multiplicative Embedding Fusion) module. MuFuse fuses value and feature embeddings through multiplicative modulation, preserving feature-specific information while modeling higher-order dependencies across features. Experiments on three real-world datasets covering both intensive and chronic care show that MedFuse consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on key predictive tasks. Analysis of the learned representations further demonstrates that multiplicative fusion enhances expressiveness and supports cross-dataset pretraining. These results establish MedFuse as a generalizable approach for modeling irregular clinical time series.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为HyperD的新型交通预测框架，通过将交通数据解耦为周期性和残差成分，分别建模多尺度周期模式和高频异常波动，在多个真实数据集上实现了最先进的预测精度、更强的鲁棒性和更高的计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通预测面临复杂空间依赖性和混合周期性与非周期性动态的挑战，现有方法难以有效分离和建模这些因素，因此需要一种能够同时捕捉多尺度周期模式和突发性扰动的新框架。

Method: 提出HyperD框架，包含两个核心模块：混合周期表示模块（使用可学习周期嵌入和时空注意力提取日/周周期模式）和频域感知残差表示模块（在频域利用复数MLP建模高频残差）；并设计双视角对齐损失函数，以强化周期分支与低频、残差分支与高频信息的语义分离。

Result: 在四个真实交通数据集上实验表明，HyperD在预测准确率上优于现有方法，尤其在面对突发事件时表现出更强的鲁棒性，同时具有更高的计算效率。

Conclusion: HyperD通过有效的周期-残差解耦和频域建模，为复杂交通时间序列预测提供了一种新范式，兼顾了周期性规律与突发性扰动的建模能力，推动了智能交通系统中预测技术的发展。

Abstract: Accurate traffic forecasting plays a vital role in intelligent transportation systems, enabling applications such as congestion control, route planning, and urban mobility optimization.However, traffic forecasting remains challenging due to two key factors: (1) complex spatial dependencies arising from dynamic interactions between road segments and traffic sensors across the network, and (2) the coexistence of multi-scale periodic patterns (e.g., daily and weekly periodic patterns driven by human routines) with irregular fluctuations caused by unpredictable events (e.g., accidents, weather, or construction). To tackle these challenges, we propose HyperD (Hybrid Periodic Decoupling), a novel framework that decouples traffic data into periodic and residual components. The periodic component is handled by the Hybrid Periodic Representation Module, which extracts fine-grained daily and weekly patterns using learnable periodic embeddings and spatial-temporal attention. The residual component, which captures non-periodic, high-frequency fluctuations, is modeled by the Frequency-Aware Residual Representation Module, leveraging complex-valued MLP in frequency domain. To enforce semantic separation between the two components, we further introduce a Dual-View Alignment Loss, which aligns low-frequency information with the periodic branch and high-frequency information with the residual branch. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that HyperD achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, while offering superior robustness under disturbances and improved computational efficiency compared to existing methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出将AI模型训练从“训练”转变为“养育”的新范式，通过重构训练数据使其从一开始就内化人类价值观。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI模型在核心能力形成后才进行价值观对齐，容易导致模型偏离人类价值，缺乏深层价值体系。

Method: 重新设计训练语料库，包括第一人称视角的数据重构、将信息重新定义为生活经验、模拟社会互动以及分阶段组织训练数据顺序。

Result: 期望模型从第一个训练token开始就建立对价值观的早期承诺，使知识、技能与价值观深度融合，难以分离。

Conclusion: ‘模型养育’范式有助于构建更具内在对齐性的AI系统，是应对超人类能力模型发展的关键路径。

Abstract: Current AI training methods align models with human values only after their core capabilities have been established, resulting in models that are easily misaligned and lack deep-rooted value systems. We propose a paradigm shift from "model training" to "model raising", in which alignment is woven into a model's development from the start. We identify several key components for this paradigm, all centered around redesigning the training corpus: reframing training data from a first-person perspective, recontextualizing information as lived experience, simulating social interactions, and scaffolding the ordering of training data. We expect that this redesign of the training corpus will lead to an early commitment to values from the first training token onward, such that knowledge, skills, and values are intrinsically much harder to separate. In an ecosystem in which large language model capabilities start overtaking human capabilities in many tasks, this seems to us like a critical need.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLM) are reshaping science, with most recent advances culminating in fully-automated scientific discovery pipelines. But qualitative research has been left behind. Researchers in qualitative methods are hesitant about AI adoption. Yet when they are willing to use AI at all, they have little choice but to rely on general-purpose tools like ChatGPT to assist with interview interpretation, data annotation, and topic modeling - while simultaneously acknowledging these system's well-known limitations of being biased, opaque, irreproducible, and privacy-compromising. This creates a critical gap: while AI has substantially advanced quantitative methods, the qualitative dimensions essential for meaning-making and comprehensive scientific understanding remain poorly integrated. We argue for developing dedicated qualitative AI systems built from the ground up for interpretive research. Such systems must be transparent, reproducible, and privacy-friendly. We review recent literature to show how existing automated discovery pipelines could be enhanced by robust qualitative capabilities, and identify key opportunities where safe qualitative AI could advance multidisciplinary and mixed-methods research.

Abstract: Safety verification of dynamical systems via barrier certificates is essential for ensuring correctness in autonomous applications. Synthesizing these certificates involves discovering mathematical functions with current methods suffering from poor scalability, dependence on carefully designed templates, and exhaustive or incremental function-space searches. They also demand substantial manual expertise--selecting templates, solvers, and hyperparameters, and designing sampling strategies--requiring both theoretical and practical knowledge traditionally shared through linguistic reasoning rather than formalized methods.
  This motivates a key question: can such expert reasoning be captured and operationalized by language models? We address this by introducing an LLM-based agentic framework for barrier certificate synthesis. The framework uses natural language reasoning to propose, refine, and validate candidate certificates, integrating LLM-driven template discovery with SMT-based verification, and supporting barrier-controller co-synthesis to ensure consistency between safety certificates and controllers.
  To evaluate this capability, we introduce BarrierBench, a benchmark of 100 dynamical systems spanning linear, nonlinear, discrete-time, and continuous-time settings. Our experiments assess not only the effectiveness of LLM-guided barrier synthesis but also the utility of retrieval-augmented generation and agentic coordination strategies in improving its reliability and performance. Across these tasks, the framework achieves more than 90% success in generating valid certificates. By releasing BarrierBench and the accompanying toolchain, we aim to establish a community testbed for advancing the integration of language-based reasoning with formal verification in dynamical systems.
  The benchmark is publicly available at https://hycodev.com/dataset/barrierbench

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文评估了2025年前沿大语言模型（LLM）在PDDL任务规划中的端到端表现，发现GPT-5在标准PDDL领域中的性能可与专业规划器LAMA相媲美；在领域和任务被混淆以测试纯推理能力时，所有LLM性能下降，但退化程度较之前报告有所减轻，显示出相比前代模型的显著进步。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究当前前沿大语言模型在复杂推理任务（如规划）中的能力，尤其是在面对标准化和混淆的PDDL任务时的表现，以评估其与传统规划器的差距及推理鲁棒性。

Method: 使用PDDL领域和任务描述作为输入，提示DeepSeek R1、Gemini 2.5 Pro、GPT-5和参考规划器LAMA生成计划，并在国际规划竞赛学习赛道的子集上进行评估，包括标准和混淆设置下的对比实验。

Result: 在标准PDDL任务中，GPT-5的求解任务数性能与LAMA相当；在混淆任务中，所有LLM性能下降但降幅小于先前报告；整体表现显示当前LLM在规划任务上的能力显著优于前代模型。

Conclusion: 前沿大语言模型（尤其是GPT-5）在端到端规划任务中的推理能力已接近专业规划器，在标准和混淆条件下均表现出较强竞争力，缩小了与传统规划方法之间的性能差距。

Abstract: The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning remains an active area of research, with the capabilities of frontier models continually advancing. We provide an updated evaluation of the end-to-end planning performance of three frontier LLMs as of 2025, where models are prompted to generate a plan from PDDL domain and task descriptions. We evaluate DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5 and as reference the planner LAMA on a subset of domains from the most recent Learning Track of the International Planning Competition. Our results show that on standard PDDL domains, the performance of GPT-5 in terms of solved tasks is competitive with LAMA. When the PDDL domains and tasks are obfuscated to test for pure reasoning, the performance of all LLMs degrades, though less severely than previously reported for other models. These results show substantial improvements over prior generations of LLMs, reducing the performance gap to planners on a challenging benchmark.

Abstract: Accessing information in learned representations is critical for scientific discovery in high-dimensional domains. We introduce a novel method based on latent flow matching with classifier-free guidance that disentangles latent subspaces by explicitly separating information included in conditioning from information that remains in the residual representation. Across three experiments -- a synthetic 2D Gaussian toy problem, colored MNIST, and the Galaxy10 astronomy dataset -- we show that our method enables access to meaningful features of high dimensional data. Our results highlight a simple yet powerful mechanism for analyzing, controlling, and repurposing latent representations, providing a pathway toward using generative models for scientific exploration of what we don't capture, consider, or catalog.

TL;DR: CrochetBench是一个用于评估多模态大语言模型在钩针编织领域进行细粒度、低层次过程推理能力的新基准，强调从描述转向执行，要求模型识别针法、选择合适的指令并生成可编译的钩针程序。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准多关注高层次描述或视觉问答，缺乏对实际操作和程序化执行能力的评估，因此需要一个专注于低层次、可执行过程推理的基准。

Method: 提出CrochetBench，采用CrochetPARADE DSL作为中间表示，支持结构验证和通过执行的功能评估，涵盖针法分类、指令定位及图文到DSL的转换任务。

Result: 实验表明，当评估重点从表面相似性转向可执行正确性时，模型性能显著下降，暴露出其在长距离符号推理和3D感知过程合成方面的不足。

Conclusion: CrochetBench为评估多模态模型的过程推理能力提供了新视角，揭示了表层理解与可执行精度之间的差距，特别是在现实世界的创造性领域中。

Abstract: We present CrochetBench, a benchmark for evaluating the ability of multimodal large language models to perform fine-grained, low-level procedural reasoning in the domain of crochet. Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on high-level description or visual question answering, CrochetBench shifts the emphasis from describing to doing: models are required to recognize stitches, select structurally appropriate instructions, and generate compilable crochet procedures. We adopt the CrochetPARADE DSL as our intermediate representation, enabling structural validation and functional evaluation via execution. The benchmark covers tasks including stitch classification, instruction grounding, and both natural language and image-to-DSL translation. Across all tasks, performance sharply declines as the evaluation shifts from surface-level similarity to executable correctness, exposing limitations in long-range symbolic reasoning and 3D-aware procedural synthesis. CrochetBench offers a new lens for assessing procedural competence in multimodal models and highlights the gap between surface-level understanding and executable precision in real-world creative domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多AI安全方法依赖于检查模型输出或激活，但某些风险无法仅通过检查发现。因此需要一种不依赖模型结构、能从模型集合中提取最安全子集特性的新方法。

Method: 提出共识采样算法，基于k个模型和提示词，在最安全的s个模型平均风险水平下进行采样，并在模型间缺乏一致时选择 abstain；利用模型输出概率，给出在足够多模型安全且达成一致时的 abstention 概率上界。

Result: 该算法能够将集合中最安全子集的安全保证放大到单一可靠模型上，提供可证明的安全增强；但当所有模型都不安全时无法提供保护，且在重复使用中可能累积风险。

Conclusion: 该方法为AI安全提供了一种新的模型无关路径，通过模型聚合和共识机制，有效提升了系统的整体安全性，尤其适用于未知哪些模型更安全的场景。

Abstract: Many approaches to AI safety rely on inspecting model outputs or activations, yet certain risks are inherently undetectable by inspection alone. We propose a complementary, architecture-agnostic approach that enhances safety through the aggregation of multiple generative models, with the aggregated model inheriting its safety from the safest subset of a given size among them. Specifically, we present a consensus sampling algorithm that, given $k$ models and a prompt, achieves risk competitive with the average risk of the safest $s$ of the $k$ models, where $s$ is a chosen parameter, while abstaining when there is insufficient agreement between them. The approach leverages the models' ability to compute output probabilities, and we bound the probability of abstention when sufficiently many models are safe and exhibit adequate agreement. The algorithm is inspired by the provable copyright protection algorithm of Vyas et al. (2023). It requires some overlap among safe models, offers no protection when all models are unsafe, and may accumulate risk over repeated use. Nonetheless, our results provide a new, model-agnostic approach for AI safety by amplifying safety guarantees from an unknown subset of models within a collection to that of a single reliable model.

Abstract: This work will elaborate the fundamental principles of physical artificial intelligence (Physical AI) from a scientific and systemic perspective. The aim is to create a theoretical foundation that describes the physical embodiment, sensory perception, ability to act, learning processes, and context sensitivity of intelligent systems within a coherent framework. While classical AI approaches rely on symbolic processing and data driven models, Physical AI understands intelligence as an emergent phenomenon of real interaction between body, environment, and experience. The six fundamentals presented here are embodiment, sensory perception, motor action, learning, autonomy, and context sensitivity, and form the conceptual basis for designing and evaluating physically intelligent systems. Theoretically, it is shown that these six principles do not represent loose functional modules but rather act as a closed control loop in which energy, information, control, and context are in constant interaction. This circular interaction enables a system to generate meaning not from databases, but from physical experience, a paradigm shift that understands intelligence as an physical embodied process. Physical AI understands learning not as parameter adjustment, but as a change in the structural coupling between agents and the environment. To illustrate this, the theoretical model is explained using a practical scenario: An adaptive assistant robot supports patients in a rehabilitation clinic. This example illustrates that physical intelligence does not arise from abstract calculation, but from immediate, embodied experience. It shows how the six fundamentals interact in a real system: embodiment as a prerequisite, perception as input, movement as expression, learning as adaptation, autonomy as regulation, and context as orientation.

Motivation: 对抗优化在零和博弈中成功应用，但在合作环境中会导致智能体自我破坏，阻碍任务完成和学习进程。为解决此问题，需保持智能体理性，避免非理性自毁行为。

Method: 提出RPO框架，并设计Rational Policy Gradient (RPG) 算法，在修改后的游戏中利用对手塑造技术训练智能体最大化自身奖励，同时满足理性保持条件。

Result: RPG有效扩展了多种现有对抗优化算法，在多个合作与一般和环境中验证了其在发现对抗样本、提升鲁棒性、适应性和策略多样性方面的性能。

Conclusion: RPO和RPG成功解决了合作多智能体中对抗优化的自我破坏问题，为更广泛的应用提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Adversarial optimization algorithms that explicitly search for flaws in agents' policies have been successfully applied to finding robust and diverse policies in multi-agent settings. However, the success of adversarial optimization has been largely limited to zero-sum settings because its naive application in cooperative settings leads to a critical failure mode: agents are irrationally incentivized to self-sabotage, blocking the completion of tasks and halting further learning. To address this, we introduce Rationality-preserving Policy Optimization (RPO), a formalism for adversarial optimization that avoids self-sabotage by ensuring agents remain rational--that is, their policies are optimal with respect to some possible partner policy. To solve RPO, we develop Rational Policy Gradient (RPG), which trains agents to maximize their own reward in a modified version of the original game in which we use opponent shaping techniques to optimize the adversarial objective. RPG enables us to extend a variety of existing adversarial optimization algorithms that, no longer subject to the limitations of self-sabotage, can find adversarial examples, improve robustness and adaptability, and learn diverse policies. We empirically validate that our approach achieves strong performance in several popular cooperative and general-sum environments.

TL;DR: 本文比较了在宽度优先搜索（BrFS）和重启随机游走（RRW）中逃离无信息启发式区域（UHRs）的两种方法，提出了理论分析与实验评估，表明在某些情况下RRW比BrFS更高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贪婪搜索方法在面对启发式局部极小值或平台区等UHRs时表现不佳，需要有效逃离这些区域以提升搜索效率。

Method: 推导了BrFS和RRW逃离UHR的期望运行时间，并基于UHR特性和随机游走过程进行理论分析；同时将标准EHC与使用RRW的EHC-RRW变体进行实验对比。

Result: 理论表明在特定条件下RRW比BrFS更快；实验显示EHC-RRW在PDDL规划基准上具有良好的预期运行性能。

Conclusion: 重启随机游走在逃离UHRs方面在理论上和实践中均优于宽度优先搜索，尤其在EHC框架下表现出更强的效率保证。

Abstract: Greedy search methods like Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS) and Enforced Hill-Climbing (EHC) often struggle when faced with Uninformed Heuristic Regions (UHRs) like heuristic local minima or plateaus. In this work, we theoretically and empirically compare two popular methods for escaping UHRs in breadth-first search (BrFS) and restarting random walks (RRWs). We first derive the expected runtime of escaping a UHR using BrFS and RRWs, based on properties of the UHR and the random walk procedure, and then use these results to identify when RRWs will be faster in expectation than BrFS. We then evaluate these methods for escaping UHRs by comparing standard EHC, which uses BrFS to escape UHRs, to variants of EHC called EHC-RRW, which use RRWs for that purpose. EHC-RRW is shown to have strong expected runtime guarantees in cases where EHC has previously been shown to be effective. We also run experiments with these approaches on PDDL planning benchmarks to better understand their relative effectiveness for escaping UHRs.
