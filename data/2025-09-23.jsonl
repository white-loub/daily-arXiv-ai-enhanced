Traditional retrieval systems rely on a\nsingle database and retriever, but financial applications require more\nsophisticated approaches to handle intricate regulatory filings, market\nanalyses, and extensive multi-year reports. We introduce a framework for\nfinancial Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) that leverages agentic AI and\nthe Multi-HyDE system, an approach that generates multiple, nonequivalent\nqueries to boost the effectiveness and coverage of retrieval from large,\nstructured financial corpora. Our pipeline is optimized for token efficiency\nand multi-step financial reasoning, and we demonstrate that their combination\nimproves accuracy by 11.2% and reduces hallucinations by 15%. Our method is\nevaluated on standard financial QA benchmarks, showing that integrating\ndomain-specific retrieval mechanisms such as Multi-HyDE with robust toolsets,\nincluding keyword and table-based retrieval, significantly enhances both the\naccuracy and reliability of answers.

However, the Euclidean\ngeometry of the embedding space limits the expressive power of DEs, which may\ncompromise their quality. This paper investigates such limitations in the\ncontext of hierarchical retrieval (HR), where the document set has a\nhierarchical structure and the matching documents for a query are all of its\nancestors. We first prove that DEs are feasible for HR as long as the embedding\ndimension is linear in the depth of the hierarchy and logarithmic in the number\nof documents. Then we study the problem of learning such embeddings in a\nstandard retrieval setup where DEs are trained on samples of matching query and\ndocument pairs. Our experiments reveal a lost-in-the-long-distance phenomenon,\nwhere retrieval accuracy degrades for documents further away in the hierarchy.\nTo address this, we introduce a pretrain-finetune recipe that significantly\nimproves long-distance retrieval without sacrificing performance on closer\ndocuments.

The experimental result in our evaluation set shows that, when\npruning is applied, the two models are effective compared to the 32K-sized\nnormal SPLADE model in the computational budget under the BM25. And the ESPLADE\nmodels are more effective than the random vocab model, while having a similar\nretrieval cost.\n  The result indicates that the size and pretrained weight of output\nvocabularies play the role of configuring the representational specification\nfor queries, documents, and their interactions in the retrieval engine, beyond\ntheir original meaning and purposes in NLP. These findings can provide a new\nroom for improvement for LSR by identifying the importance of representational\nspecification from vocabulary configuration for efficient and effective\nretrieval."}

Prior studies have shown\nthat thyroid texture is important for segregating the thyroid ultrasound images\ninto different classes. Based upon our experience with breast cancer\nclassification, we first conjuncture that the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)\nis the best descriptor for capturing textural features. Thyroid ultrasound\nimages are particularly challenging as the gland is surrounded by multiple\ncomplex anatomical structures leading to variations in tissue density. Hence,\nwe second conjuncture the importance of localization and propose that the Local\nDCT (LDCT) descriptor captures the textural features best in this context.\nAnother disadvantage of complex anatomy around the thyroid gland is scattering\nof ultrasound waves resulting in noisy and unclear textures. Hence, we third\nconjuncture that one image descriptor is not enough to fully capture the\ntextural features and propose the integration of another popular texture\ncapturing descriptor (Improved Local Binary Pattern, ILBP) with LDCT. ILBP is\nknown to be noise resilient as well. We term our novel descriptor as Binary\nPattern Driven Local Discrete Cosine Transform (BPD-LDCT). Final classification\nis carried out using a non-linear SVM. The proposed CAD system is evaluated on\nthe only two publicly available thyroid cancer datasets, namely TDID and AUITD.\nThe evaluation is conducted in two stages. In Stage I, thyroid nodules are\ncategorized as benign or malignant. In Stage II, the malignant cases are\nfurther sub-classified into TI-RADS (4) and TI-RADS (5). For Stage I\nclassification, our proposed model demonstrates exceptional performance of\nnearly 100% on TDID and 97% on AUITD. In Stage II classification, the proposed\nmodel again attains excellent classification of close to 100% on TDID and 99%\non AUITD."}

Unlike state-based RL,\nvision-based RL is much more memory inefficient, resulting in relatively low\nbatch sizes, which is not amenable for algorithms like PPO. Nevertheless, it is\nstill an attractive method as unlike the more commonly used techniques which\ndistill state-based policies into vision networks, end-to-end RL can allow for\nemergent active vision behaviors. We identify a key bottleneck in training\nthese policies is the way most existing simulators scale to multiple GPUs using\ntraditional data parallelism techniques. We propose a new method where we\ndisaggregate the simulator and RL (both training and experience buffers) onto\nseparate GPUs. On a node with four GPUs, we have the simulator running on three\nof them, and PPO running on the fourth. We are able to show that with the same\nnumber of GPUs, we can double the number of existing environments compared to\nthe previous baseline of standard data parallelism. This allows us to train\nvision-based environments, end-to-end with depth, which were previously\nperforming far worse with the baseline. We train and distill both depth and\nstate-based policies into stereo RGB networks and show that depth distillation\nleads to better results, both in simulation and reality. This improvement is\nlikely due to the observability gap between state and vision policies which\ndoes not exist when distilling depth policies into stereo RGB.

This can lead to wasted materials,\nmachine downtime, and increased costs. In this paper, we present a smarter way\nto use SPC. Instead of just reacting to issues after they happen, our system\ncan predict future problems before they occur. We use a machine learning tool\ncalled Facebook Prophet, which is designed to work with time-series data (data\nthat changes over time). Prophet looks at past data and forecasts what the next\nvalue will be. Then, we use SPC rules to decide if the predicted value is in a\nSafe zone (no problem), a Warning zone (needs attention), or a Critical zone\n(may require shutting down the process).

A rule is a global\nproperty or a pattern concerning a large portion of the input space of a\nnetwork.

Here, three problems will be\nin the focus: Does a given set of rules apply to a given network? Is a given\nset of rules consistent or do the rules contradict themselves? Is a given set\nof rules exhaustive in the sense that for every input the output is determined?\nFinding algorithms that extract such rules out of networks has been\ninvestigated over the last 30 years, however, to the author's current\nknowledge, no attempt in verification was made until now. A lot of attempts of\nextracting rules use heuristics involving randomness and over-approximation, so\nit might be beneficial to know whether knowledge obtained in that way can\nactually be trusted.\n  We investigate the above questions for neural networks with ReLU-activation\nas well as for Boolean networks, each for several types of rules.

We first curate a large dataset of Reddit posts\nspanning six mental health conditions and a control group, using rigorous\nfiltering and statistical exploratory analysis to ensure annotation quality. We\nthen evaluate five transformer architectures (BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT,\nALBERT, and ELECTRA) against several LSTM variants (with or without attention,\nusing contextual or static embeddings) under identical conditions. Experimental\nresults show that transformer models consistently outperform the alternatives,\nwith RoBERTa achieving 91-99% F1-scores and accuracies across all classes.\nNotably, attention-augmented LSTMs with BERT embeddings approach transformer\nperformance (up to 97% F1-score) while training 2-3.5 times faster, whereas\nLSTMs using static embeddings fail to learn useful signals. These findings\nrepresent the first comprehensive benchmark for multi-class mental health\ndetection, offering practical guidance on model selection and highlighting an\naccuracy-efficiency trade-off for real-world deployment of mental health NLP\nsystems."}

To explore this question, we formulate it as a game with\nincomplete information, where attackers know only one target agent and lack\nknowledge of the other agents in the system.

In this\npaper, we introduce the Seeing Culture Benchmark (SCB), focusing on cultural\nreasoning with a novel approach that requires VLMs to reason on culturally rich\nimages in two stages: i) selecting the correct visual option with\nmultiple-choice visual question answering (VQA), and ii) segmenting the\nrelevant cultural artifact as evidence of reasoning. Visual options in the\nfirst stage are systematically organized into three types: those originating\nfrom the same country, those from different countries, or a mixed group.\nNotably, all options are derived from a singular category for each type.\nProgression to the second stage occurs only after a correct visual option is\nchosen. The SCB benchmark comprises 1,065 images that capture 138 cultural\nartifacts across five categories from seven Southeast Asia countries, whose\ndiverse cultures are often overlooked, accompanied by 3,178 questions, of which\n1,093 are unique and meticulously curated by human annotators.

Prior work aims to mitigate this bottleneck by exploiting\nsparsity in the attention layers to reduce computation. However, these works\ntypically rely on block-sparse attention, which skips score computation only\nwhen all entries in a block of attention scores (corresponding to M queries and\nM keys, with M = 64 typically) are zero. This coarse-granular skipping of\nattention scores does not fully exploit sparsity in the attention map and\nleaves room for improvement. In this work, we propose FG-Attn, a sparse\nattention mechanism for long-context diffusion transformers that leverages\nsparsity at a fine granularity. Unlike block-sparse attention, which skips\nentire MxM blocks, our approach skips computations at the granularity of Mx1\nslices of the attention map. Each slice is produced by query-key dot products\nbetween a block of query vectors and a single key. To implement our proposed\nsparse attention mechanism, we develop a new efficient bulk-load operation\ncalled asynchronous-gather load.

Leveraging fixed-point theory and Hausdorff distance, the planner\ncomputes convergent spatial states under interaction characteristics and\nmission constraints. By homogenously representing multi-dimensional\nenvironmental characteristics through work, the robot can approach the imagined\nspatial states via real-time computation of energy gradients. Consequently,\nexperimental results demonstrate the practicality and robustness of I-MP in\ncomplex cluttered environments."}

Existing toxicity mitigation approaches\nprimarily manipulate individual neuron activations, but these methods suffer\nfrom instability, context dependence, and often compromise the model's core\nlanguage abilities. To address these shortcomings, we investigate three key\nquestions: the stability of neuron-level toxicity indicators, the advantages of\nstructural (layer-wise) representations, and the interpretability of mechanisms\ndriving toxic generation. Through extensive experiments on Jigsaw and ToxiCN\ndatasets, we show that aggregated layer-wise features provide more robust\nsignals than single neurons. Moreover, we observe conceptual limitations in\nprior works that conflate toxicity detection experts and generation experts\nwithin neuron-based interventions. To mitigate this, we propose a novel\nprincipled intervention technique, EigenShift, based on eigen-decomposition of\nthe language model's final output layer.

The main\nchallenges in this task are preserving the identity of the reference portrait,\naccurately transferring target expressions, and maintaining long-term temporal\nconsistency while ensuring generation efficiency. To address identity\npreservation and accurate expression retargeting, we enhance Stable Diffusion\nwith two key components: a expression-aware landmarks as explicit motion\nsignals, which improve motion alignment, support exaggerated expressions, and\nreduce identity leakage; and a fine-grained facial loss that leverages both\nexpression and facial masks to better capture subtle expressions and faithfully\npreserve the reference appearance. With these components, our model supports\ncontrollable and expressive animation across diverse portrait types, including\nreal faces, cartoons, sculptures, and animals. However, diffusion-based\nframeworks typically struggle to efficiently generate long-term stable\nanimation results, which remains a core challenge in this task. To address\nthis, we propose a progressive generation strategy for stable long-term\nanimation, and introduce a Taylor-interpolated cache, achieving a 2.6X lossless\nacceleration. These two strategies ensure that our method produces high-quality\nresults efficiently, making it user-friendly and accessible. Finally, we\nintroduce EmojiBench++, a more comprehensive benchmark comprising diverse\nportraits, driving videos, and landmark sequences.

To\naddress this issue, we propose \\textit{Teacher Value-based Knowledge\nDistillation} (TVKD), which introduces an auxiliary reward from the value\nfunction of the teacher model to provide a soft guide. This auxiliary reward is\nformulated to satisfy potential-based reward shaping, ensuring that the global\nreward structure and optimal policy of DPO are preserved.

However, mainstream methods trained via\nimitation learning suffer from critical safety limitations, as they fail to\ndistinguish between trajectories that appear human-like but are potentially\nunsafe. Some recent approaches attempt to address this by regressing multiple\nrule-driven scores but decoupling supervision from policy optimization,\nresulting in suboptimal performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose\nDriveDPO, a Safety Direct Preference Optimization Policy Learning framework.\nFirst, we distill a unified policy distribution from human imitation similarity\nand rule-based safety scores for direct policy optimization. Further, we\nintroduce an iterative Direct Preference Optimization stage formulated as\ntrajectory-level preference alignment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM\nbenchmark demonstrate that DriveDPO achieves a new state-of-the-art PDMS of\n90.0.

The challenge lies in the\ncombinatorial nature of instruction specifications: each instruction can\ninclude multiple specifications, and the number of possible specification\ncombinations grows exponentially as the robot's skill set expands. For example,\n\"overtake the pedestrian while staying on the right side of the road\" consists\nof two specifications: \"overtake the pedestrian\" and \"walk on the right side of\nthe road.\" To tackle this challenge, we propose ComposableNav, based on the\nintuition that following an instruction involves independently satisfying its\nconstituent specifications, each corresponding to a distinct motion primitive.\nUsing diffusion models, ComposableNav learns each primitive separately, then\ncomposes them in parallel at deployment time to satisfy novel combinations of\nspecifications unseen in training. Additionally, to avoid the onerous need for\ndemonstrations of individual motion primitives, we propose a two-stage training\nprocedure: (1) supervised pre-training to learn a base diffusion model for\ndynamic navigation, and (2) reinforcement learning fine-tuning that molds the\nbase model into different motion primitives. Through simulation and real-world\nexperiments, we show that ComposableNav enables robots to follow instructions\nby generating trajectories that satisfy diverse and unseen combinations of\nspecifications, significantly outperforming both non-compositional VLM-based\npolicies and costmap composing baselines.

However, IL policies often struggle when faced with\nout-of-distribution observations; for instance, when the target object is in a\npreviously unseen position or occluded by other objects. In these cases,\nextensive demonstrations are needed for current IL methods to reach robust and\ngeneralizable behaviors. But when humans are faced with these sorts of atypical\ninitial states, we often rearrange the environment for more favorable task\nexecution. For example, a person might rotate a coffee cup so that it is easier\nto grasp the handle, or push a box out of the way so they can directly grasp\ntheir target object. In this work we seek to equip robot learners with the same\ncapability: enabling robots to prepare the environment before executing their\ngiven policy. We propose ReSET, an algorithm that takes initial states -- which\nare outside the policy's distribution -- and autonomously modifies object poses\nso that the restructured scene is similar to training data. Theoretically, we\nshow that this two step process (rearranging the environment before rolling out\nthe given policy) reduces the generalization gap. Practically, our ReSET\nalgorithm combines action-agnostic human videos with task-agnostic\nteleoperation data to i) decide when to modify the scene, ii) predict what\nsimplifying actions a human would take, and iii) map those predictions into\nrobot action primitives. Comparisons with diffusion policies, VLAs, and other\nbaselines show that using ReSET to prepare the environment enables more robust\ntask execution with equal amounts of total training data.

Existing MU methods based on label manipulation or model weight\nperturbations often achieve limited unlearning effectiveness. To address this,\nwe introduce CoUn, a novel MU framework inspired by the observation that a\nmodel retrained from scratch using only retain data classifies forget data\nbased on their semantic similarity to the retain data. CoUn emulates this\nbehavior by adjusting learned data representations through contrastive learning\n(CL) and supervised learning, applied exclusively to retain data.

While recent methods\nleverage a Region-of-Interest (RoI) mechanism to focus on salient areas, they\ntypically present a difficult trade-off: training-based approaches depend on\nlarge-scale annotated datasets, while training-free methods that utilize the\nmodel's internal attention are computationally inefficient and less accurate,\nrequiring either multi-pass prefill stages or reliance on the slow\nauto-regressive decoding process. In this paper, we propose an efficient,\nannotation-free Self-Distilled Region Proposal Network (SD-RPN) that resolves\nthis trade-off. The SD-RPN is built around a pipeline that transforms the noisy\nattention maps from the MLLM's middle layers into high-quality pseudo-RoI\nlabels by explicitly denoising the signal and resolving ambiguity. We use these\nlabels to train a lightweight Region Proposal Network (RPN) that learns a more\nprecise localization. This RPN is also highly efficient, predicting the RoI in\na single forward pass using features from the MLLM's middle layers, decoupling\nRoI identification from the auto-regressive generation and avoiding costly\nmulti-pass operations.To validate our approach, we integrate the framework into\nthe LLaVA-1.5 architecture.

Event data offer significant benefits such as high temporal resolution\nand low latency, but their application to hand pose estimation is still limited\nby the scarcity of labeled training data. To address this, we repurpose real\nRGB datasets to train event-based estimators.

We introduce a family of drop-in\nselectors for projection directions: BOSW, a one-shot BO scheme on the unit\nsphere; RBOSW, a periodic-refresh variant; ABOSW, an adaptive hybrid that seeds\nfrom competitive QSW sets and performs a few lightweight BO refinements; and\nARBOSW, a restarted hybrid that periodically relearns directions during\noptimization.

We investigate\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG, a knowledge graph-enhanced\nRAG approach, for page-level question answering in an undergraduate mathematics\ntextbook.

We curate a dataset of 477 question-answer\npairs, each tied to a distinct textbook page. We then compare the standard\nembedding-based RAG methods to GraphRAG for evaluating both retrieval\naccuracy-whether the correct page is retrieved-and generated answer quality via\nF1 scores. Our findings show that embedding-based RAG achieves higher retrieval\naccuracy and better F1 scores compared to GraphRAG, which tends to retrieve\nexcessive and sometimes irrelevant content due to its entity-based structure.\nWe also explored re-ranking the retrieved pages with LLM and observed mixed\nresults, including performance drop and hallucinations when dealing with larger\ncontext windows.

Although most existing research in CLL emphasizes the\ndevelopment of novel loss functions, the potential of data augmentation in this\ndomain remains largely underexplored. In this work, we uncover that the\nwidely-used Mixup data augmentation technique is ineffective when directly\napplied to CLL. Through in-depth analysis, we identify that the\ncomplementary-label noise generated by Mixup negatively impacts the performance\nof CLL models. We then propose an improved technique called Intra-Cluster Mixup\n(ICM), which only synthesizes augmented data from nearby examples, to mitigate\nthe noise effect. ICM carries the benefits of encouraging complementary label\nsharing of nearby examples, and leads to substantial performance improvements\nacross synthetic and real-world labeled datasets.

In this thesis, I will\ndiscuss selected works on two domains: (1) tactile sensing and (2)\nrehabilitation robots, which are exemplars of data sparsity and scarcity,\nrespectively. Tactile sensing is an essential modality for robotics, but\ntactile data are often sparse, and for each interaction with the physical\nworld, tactile sensors can only obtain information about the local area of\ncontact. I will discuss my work on learning vision-free tactile-only\nexploration and manipulation policies through model-free reinforcement learning\nto make efficient use of sparse tactile information. On the other hand,\nrehabilitation robots are an example of data scarcity to the extreme due to the\nsignificant challenge of collecting biosignals from disabled-bodied subjects at\nscale for training.

We propose a Multi-Expert Mamba (ME-Mamba) system that captures\ndiscriminative pathological and genomic features while enabling efficient\nintegration of both modalities. This approach achieves complementary\ninformation fusion without losing critical information from individual\nmodalities, thereby facilitating accurate cancer survival analysis.\nSpecifically, we first introduce a Pathology Expert and a Genomics Expert to\nprocess unimodal data separately. Both experts are designed with Mamba\narchitectures that incorporate conventional scanning and attention-based\nscanning mechanisms, allowing them to extract discriminative features from long\ninstance sequences containing substantial redundant or irrelevant information.\nSecond, we design a Synergistic Expert responsible for modality fusion. It\nexplicitly learns token-level local correspondences between the two modalities\nvia Optimal Transport, and implicitly enhances distribution consistency through\na global cross-modal fusion loss based on Maximum Mean Discrepancy. The fused\nfeature representations are then passed to a mamba backbone for further\nintegration.

To address this gap, we introduce the Deceptive Reasoning\nExposure Suite (D-REX), a novel dataset designed to evaluate the discrepancy\nbetween a model's internal reasoning process and its final output.

This work addresses the unique challenges involved in applying\nideas from speculative decoding of AR-LLMs to the dLLM setting. Spiffy proposes\ndraft states by leveraging the dLLM's distribution itself in an\nauto-speculative manner. This approach is efficient and effective, and\neliminates the overheads of training and running an independent draft model. To\nstructure the candidate draft states, we propose a novel directed draft graph\nwhich is uniquely designed to take advantage of the bidirectional, block-wise\nnature of dLLM generation and can be verified in parallel by the dLLM.

Thyroid ultrasound\nimages are particularly challenging as the gland is surrounded by multiple\ncomplex anatomical structures leading to variations in tissue density.

In this paper, we present an\ninformative framework for text-guided affordance learning, which involves\ninformation-based constraints to achieve text-image alignment at feature level.\nSpecifically, we design an affordance mutual information constraint that helps\nlearn appropriate textual prompts and task-oriented visual features\nsimultaneously by maximizing the mutual information between the features of the\naffordance areas in the input images and the corresponding textual prompts. In\naddition, we propose an object-level information constraint that maximizes the\nmutual information between the visual features of a given object and the text\nfeatures of the category it belongs to. This enables the model to capture\nhigh-quality representations for the object, providing more reliable semantic\npriors for identifying affordance regions. Experimental results on the AGD20K\ndataset show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches and\nachieves the new state-of-the-art in one-shot affordance learning."}

We introduce Chat-CBM, which replaces score-based\nclassifiers with a language-based classifier that reasons directly over concept\nsemantics. By grounding prediction in the semantic space of concepts, Chat-CBM\npreserves the interpretability of CBMs while enabling richer and more intuitive\ninterventions, such as concept correction, addition or removal of concepts,\nincorporation of external knowledge, and high-level reasoning guidance.\nLeveraging the language understanding and few-shot capabilities of frozen large\nlanguage models, Chat-CBM extends the intervention interface of CBMs beyond\nnumerical editing and remains effective even in unsupervised settings.\nExperiments on nine datasets demonstrate that Chat-CBM achieves higher\npredictive performance and substantially improves user interactivity while\nmaintaining the concept-based interpretability of CBMs."}

Motivated by this, we introduce CodeGym, a\nscalable framework that synthesizes diverse, verifiable, and controllable\nmulti-turn tool-use environments for agent RL, enabling LLM agents to explore\nand master various workflows actively. CodeGym rewrites static coding problems\ninto interactive environments by extracting atomic functions or logic into\ncallable tools, yielding verifiable tasks that span various tool-execution\nworkflows. Models of varying sizes and chain-of-thought configurations, trained\nin CodeGym, exhibit consistent out-of-distribution generalizability; for\nexample, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct achieves an absolute accuracy gain of 8.7 points\non the OOD benchmark $\\tau$-Bench.

To overcome this, we introduce a novel approach that\nleverages the strong \\textit{zero-shot capabilities} of recent vision-language\nfoundation models (VLMs) like CLIP, concentrating solely on label space\nalignment to enhance adaptation stability.

However, current\nmethods either condense queries and candidates into a single vector,\npotentially limiting the expressiveness for fine-grained information, or\nproduce too many vectors that are prohibitively expensive for multi-vector\nretrieval. In this work, we introduce MetaEmbed, a new framework for multimodal\nretrieval that rethinks how multimodal embeddings are constructed and\ninteracted with at scale. During training, a fixed number of learnable Meta\nTokens are appended to the input sequence. At test-time, their last-layer\ncontextualized representations serve as compact yet expressive multi-vector\nembeddings. Through the proposed Matryoshka Multi-Vector Retrieval training,\nMetaEmbed learns to organize information by granularity across multiple\nvectors.

For example,\n\"overtake the pedestrian while staying on the right side of the road\" consists\nof two specifications: \"overtake the pedestrian\" and \"walk on the right side of\nthe road.\" To tackle this challenge, we propose ComposableNav, based on the\nintuition that following an instruction involves independently satisfying its\nconstituent specifications, each corresponding to a distinct motion primitive.\nUsing diffusion models, ComposableNav learns each primitive separately, then\ncomposes them in parallel at deployment time to satisfy novel combinations of\nspecifications unseen in training.

However, IL policies often struggle when faced with\nout-of-distribution observations; for instance, when the target object is in a\npreviously unseen position or occluded by other objects. In these cases,\nextensive demonstrations are needed for current IL methods to reach robust and\ngeneralizable behaviors. But when humans are faced with these sorts of atypical\ninitial states, we often rearrange the environment for more favorable task\nexecution.

In this work we seek to equip robot learners with the same\ncapability: enabling robots to prepare the environment before executing their\ngiven policy. We propose ReSET, an algorithm that takes initial states -- which\nare outside the policy's distribution -- and autonomously modifies object poses\nso that the restructured scene is similar to training data. Theoretically, we\nshow that this two step process (rearranging the environment before rolling out\nthe given policy) reduces the generalization gap.

This paper introduces a\nnew recommendation method to make such expertise accessible, based on a\nKnowledge Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG RAG) framework. To\naddress this, a domain-specific knowledge graph is constructed from published\nliterature. The method then employs a multi-faceted retrieval mechanism to\ngather relevant evidence from this knowledge graph using three distinct\napproaches, which include a precise graph-based search, flexible vector-based\nsearch, and high-level cluster-based search. The retrieved evidence is utilized\nby a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate algorithm recommendations with\ndata-driven reasoning. The proposed KG-RAG method is compared against a\ncommercial LLM chatbot with access to the knowledge base as a table, across a\nseries of diverse, real-world FLP test cases. Based on recommendation accuracy\nand reasoning capability, the proposed method performed significantly better\nthan the commercial LLM chatbot."}

Based on our\nobservations, the uncertainty manifold holds enough consistent information to\nleverage uncertainty for deepfake source detection. Our approach leverages\nBayesian Neural Networks and Monte Carlo dropout to quantify both aleatoric and\nepistemic uncertainties across diverse detector architectures. We evaluate\nuncertainty on two datasets with nine generators, with four blind and two\nbiological detectors, compare different uncertainty methods, explore region-\nand pixel-based uncertainty, and conduct ablation studies. We conduct and\nanalyze binary real/fake, multi-class real/fake, source detection, and\nleave-one-out experiments between the generator/detector combinations to share\ntheir generalization capability, model calibration, uncertainty, and robustness\nagainst adversarial attacks. We further introduce uncertainty maps that\nlocalize prediction confidence at the pixel level, revealing distinct patterns\ncorrelated with generator-specific artifacts. Our analysis provides critical\ninsights for deploying reliable deepfake detection systems and establishes\nuncertainty quantification as a fundamental requirement for trustworthy\nsynthetic media detection."}

However, numerous studies have\nshown that LoRA often introduces substantial parameter redundancy, which not\nonly increases the number of trainable parameters but also hinders the\neffectiveness of fine-tuning. Since identifying redundant parameters in LoRA is\ninherently difficult, how to eliminate them efficiently and accurately remains\na challenging problem. In this paper, we propose TASO, a redundancy reduction\nmethod that leverages importance information from the pretrained model's\nweights to mitigate LoRA redundancy. Specifically, we estimate parameter\nimportance on downstream tasks and identify task-specific core regions based on\nthe distribution of importance scores. The location information of these core\nregions is then used to determine the sparse structure of LoRA modules,\nenabling redundancy removal before fine-tuning. Our approach significantly\nreduces the number of trainable parameters required for task adaptation, while\nproviding a novel task-aligned perspective for LoRA redundancy reduction.\nExperimental results demonstrate that, with a parameter budget comparable to\nLoRA with rank $r = 1$, TASO consistently outperforms standard LoRA across\nmultiple tasks, achieving strong fine-tuning performance while effectively\neliminating redundant parameters."}

Traditionally,\ninspection has often been reduced to navigation tasks, where the objective is\nto reach a predefined location while avoiding obstacles. However, this\nformulation captures only part of the real inspection problem. In real-world\nenvironments, the inspection targets may become visible well before their exact\ncoordinates are reached, making further movement both redundant and\ninefficient. What matters more for inspection is not simply arriving at the\ntarget's position, but positioning the robot at a viewpoint from which the\ntarget becomes observable. In this work, we revisit inspection from a\nperception-aware perspective. We propose an end-to-end reinforcement learning\nframework that explicitly incorporates target visibility as the primary\nobjective, enabling the robot to find the shortest trajectory that guarantees\nvisual contact with the target without relying on a map. The learned policy\nleverages both perceptual and proprioceptive sensing and is trained entirely in\nsimulation, before being deployed to a real-world robot. We further develop an\nalgorithm to compute ground-truth shortest inspection paths, which provides a\nreference for evaluation.

The challenge lies in the\ncombinatorial nature of instruction specifications: each instruction can\ninclude multiple specifications, and the number of possible specification\ncombinations grows exponentially as the robot's skill set expands. For example,\n\"overtake the pedestrian while staying on the right side of the road\" consists\nof two specifications: \"overtake the pedestrian\" and \"walk on the right side of\nthe road.\" To tackle this challenge, we propose ComposableNav, based on the\nintuition that following an instruction involves independently satisfying its\nconstituent specifications, each corresponding to a distinct motion primitive.\nUsing diffusion models, ComposableNav learns each primitive separately, then\ncomposes them in parallel at deployment time to satisfy novel combinations of\nspecifications unseen in training. Additionally, to avoid the onerous need for\ndemonstrations of individual motion primitives, we propose a two-stage training\nprocedure: (1) supervised pre-training to learn a base diffusion model for\ndynamic navigation, and (2) reinforcement learning fine-tuning that molds the\nbase model into different motion primitives. Through simulation and real-world\nexperiments, we show that ComposableNav enables robots to follow instructions\nby generating trajectories that satisfy diverse and unseen combinations of\nspecifications, significantly outperforming both non-compositional VLM-based\npolicies and costmap composing baselines.

To address this challenge, most researchers focus\non the dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) technique to balance the\nlatency and energy consumption by changing the computing frequency of\nprocessors. However, the adjustment of memory frequency is usually ignored and\nnot fully utilized to achieve efficient DNN inference, which also plays a\nsignificant role in the inference time and energy consumption. In this paper,\nwe first investigate the impact of joint memory frequency and computing\nfrequency scaling on the inference time and energy consumption with a\nmodel-based and data-driven method.

This alternative supervision is appealing\nbecause collecting complementary labels is generally cheaper and less\nlabor-intensive. Although most existing research in CLL emphasizes the\ndevelopment of novel loss functions, the potential of data augmentation in this\ndomain remains largely underexplored. In this work, we uncover that the\nwidely-used Mixup data augmentation technique is ineffective when directly\napplied to CLL. Through in-depth analysis, we identify that the\ncomplementary-label noise generated by Mixup negatively impacts the performance\nof CLL models.

In this work, we introduce MetaEmbed, a new framework for multimodal\nretrieval that rethinks how multimodal embeddings are constructed and\ninteracted with at scale. During training, a fixed number of learnable Meta\nTokens are appended to the input sequence. At test-time, their last-layer\ncontextualized representations serve as compact yet expressive multi-vector\nembeddings.
