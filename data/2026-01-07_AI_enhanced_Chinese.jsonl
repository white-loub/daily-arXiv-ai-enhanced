A common use case, for graphs with labeled nodes, seeks to find instances of a \\textit{query} graph with $q$ nodes in a (typically larger) \\textit{data} graph with $d$ nodes. The problem is NP-complete, and na\u00efve solutions are exponential in $q + d$. The fastest current heuristic has complexity $O(d^2)$. This paper outlines ASSIST (Approximate Swarming Subgraph Isomorphism through Stigmergy), inspired by the ant colony optimization approach to the traveling salesperson. After peering (identifying matching individual nodes in query and data) in time $O(q\\cdot log(d))$, the time required for ASSIST's iterative subgraph search, the combinatorially complex part of the problem, is linear in query size and constant in data size. ASSIST can be extended to support matching problems (such as temporally ordered edges, inexact matches, and missing nodes or edges in the data graph) that frustrate other heuristics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aASSIST\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u6700\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u5b50\u56fe\u540c\u6784\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5176\u641c\u7d22\u9636\u6bb5\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027\u4e8e\u67e5\u8be2\u56fe\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u5e38\u6570\u7ea7\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u56fe\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u6269\u5c55\u5339\u914d\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6700\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u5b50\u56fe\u540c\u6784\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff08\u5982O(d\u00b2)\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5e26\u6709\u65f6\u5e8f\u8fb9\u3001\u4e0d\u7cbe\u786e\u5339\u914d\u3001\u7f3a\u5931\u8282\u70b9\u6216\u8fb9\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u5339\u914d\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u53d7\u8681\u7fa4\u4f18\u5316\u542f\u53d1\uff0cASSIST\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7O(q\u00b7log(d))\u65f6\u95f4\u5b8c\u6210\u8282\u70b9\u914d\u5bf9\uff08peering\uff09\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u7d20\u673a\u5236\uff08stigmergy\uff09\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u7fa4\u4f53\u641c\u7d22\u8fdb\u884c\u5b50\u56fe\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u4f7f\u6838\u5fc3\u641c\u7d22\u9636\u6bb5\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u964d\u4e3aO(q)\u3002", "result": "ASSIST\u5728\u5b50\u56fe\u641c\u7d22\u9636\u6bb5\u5b9e\u73b0\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7ebf\u6027\u4e8e\u67e5\u8be2\u56fe\u5927\u5c0fq\u3001\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u56fe\u5927\u5c0fd\u65e0\u5173\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u652f\u6301\u65f6\u5e8f\u8fb9\u3001\u4e0d\u7cbe\u786e\u5339\u914d\u53ca\u7f3a\u5931\u7ed3\u6784\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u6027\u5339\u914d\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "ASSIST\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b50\u56fe\u540c\u6784\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u5339\u914d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

This goal can be achieved using Explainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL) techniques. Although textual explanations are easily understood by humans, ensuring their correctness remains a challenge, and evaluations in state-of-the-art remain limited. We present a novel XRL framework for generating textual explanations, converting them into a set of transparent rules, improving their quality, and evaluating them. Expert's knowledge can be incorporated into this framework, and an automatic predicate generator is also proposed to determine the semantic information of a state. Textual explanations are generated using a Large Language Model (LLM) and a clustering technique to identify frequent conditions. These conditions are then converted into rules to evaluate their properties, fidelity, and performance in the deployed environment. Two refinement techniques are proposed to improve the quality of explanations and reduce conflicting information. Experiments were conducted in three open-source environments to enable reproducibility, and in a telecom use case to evaluate the industrial applicability of the proposed XRL framework. This framework addresses the limitations of an existing method, Autonomous Policy Explanation, and the generated transparent rules can achieve satisfactory performance on certain tasks. This framework also enables a systematic and quantitative evaluation of textual explanations, providing valuable insights for the XRL field.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08XRL\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u548c\u805a\u7c7b\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u900f\u660e\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u81ea\u52a8\u8c13\u8bcd\u751f\u6210\u5668\u63d0\u5347\u89e3\u91ca\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u53ef\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u73af\u5883\u53ca\u5de5\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709XRL\u4e2d\u6587\u672c\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u969c\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u5b9a\u91cf\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u81ea\u4e3b\u7b56\u7565\u89e3\u91ca\uff08APE\uff09\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2aXRL\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u7528LLM\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u805a\u7c7b\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u89e3\u91ca\uff1b2\uff09\u5c06\u89e3\u91ca\u6761\u4ef6\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u900f\u660e\u89c4\u5219\uff1b3\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u8c13\u8bcd\u751f\u6210\u5668\u63d0\u53d6\u72b6\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\uff1b4\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e24\u79cd\u89c4\u5219\u7cbe\u70bc\u6280\u672f\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u51b2\u7a81\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff1b5\uff09\u5728\u5f00\u6e90\u73af\u5883\u4e0e\u7535\u4fe1\u5de5\u4e1a\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u5f00\u5c55\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u73af\u5883\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7535\u4fe1\u5b9e\u9645\u7528\u4f8b\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u4e0e\u5de5\u4e1a\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff1b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u900f\u660e\u89c4\u5219\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6ee1\u610f\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u3001\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5f25\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709XRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u4e0e\u5de5\u4e1a\u843d\u5730\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e3aXRL\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u53ef\u96c6\u6210\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Manchester"], "title": "Trust in LLM-controlled Robotics: a Survey of Security Threats, Defenses and Challenges", "comment": null, "summary": "The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into robotics has revolutionized their ability to interpret complex human commands and execute sophisticated tasks. However, such paradigm shift introduces critical security vulnerabilities stemming from the ''embodiment gap'', a discord between the LLM's abstract reasoning and the physical, context-dependent nature of robotics. While security for text-based LLMs is an active area of research, existing solutions are often insufficient to address the unique threats for the embodied robotic agents, where malicious outputs manifest not merely as harmful text but as dangerous physical actions. In this work, we present a systematic survey, summarizing the emerging threat landscape and corresponding defense strategies for LLM-controlled robotics. Specifically, we discuss a comprehensive taxonomy of attack vectors, covering topics such as jailbreaking, backdoor attacks, and multi-modal prompt injection. In response, we analyze and categorize a range of defense mechanisms, from formal safety specifications and runtime enforcement to multi-LLM oversight and prompt hardening.

While Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) like Dense-Unet have shown promise in removing these artifacts via inpainting, they often require large labeled datasets which are scarce in the medical domain. Inspired by recent advancements in Masked Autoencoders (MAE) for 3D point clouds, we propose \\textbf{Dense-MAE}, a novel self-supervised learning framework for volumetric medical data. We introduce a pre-training strategy that randomly masks 3D patches of the vessel lumen and trains the Dense-Unet to reconstruct the missing geometry. This forces the encoder to learn high-level latent features of arterial topology without human annotation. Experimental results on clinical CTA datasets demonstrate that initializing the Calcium Removal network with our MAE-based weights significantly improves inpainting accuracy and stenosis estimation compared to training from scratch, specifically in few-shot scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDense-MAE\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a9\u7801\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u51a0\u72b6\u52a8\u8109\u9499\u5316\u4f2a\u5f71\u53bb\u9664\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ece\u5934\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u51a0\u72b6\u52a8\u8109\u9499\u5316\u5728CTA\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u6655\u67d3\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u7ba1\u8154\u72ed\u7a84\u8bca\u65ad\uff1b\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eDCNN\u7684\u53bb\u4f2a\u5f71\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDense-MAE\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5728Dense-Unet\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u91c7\u75283D\u4f53\u7d20\u5757\u968f\u673a\u63a9\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u5efa\u88ab\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u8840\u7ba1\u7ba1\u8154\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u8109\u62d3\u6251\u7684\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u9690\u5f0f\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e34\u5e8aCTA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Dense-MAE\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6743\u91cd\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u9499\u5316\u53bb\u9664\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4ece\u96f6\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4f2a\u5f71\u53bb\u9664\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u72ed\u7a84\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Dense-MAE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u4e09\u7ef4\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Existing benchmarks largely overlook these complexities, focusing instead on clean or generic conversational audio. To bridge this gap, we present WearVox, the first benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate voice assistants in realistic wearable scenarios. WearVox comprises 3,842 multi-channel, egocentric audio recordings collected via AI glasses across five diverse tasks including Search-Grounded QA, Closed-Book QA, Side-Talk Rejection, Tool Calling, and Speech Translation, spanning a wide range of indoor and outdoor environments and acoustic conditions. Each recording is accompanied by rich metadata, enabling nuanced analysis of model performance under real-world constraints. We benchmark leading proprietary and open-source speech Large Language Models (SLLMs) and find that most real-time SLLMs achieve accuracies on WearVox ranging from 29% to 59%, with substantial performance degradation on noisy outdoor audio, underscoring the difficulty and realism of the benchmark. Additionally, we conduct a case study with two new SLLMs that perform inference with single-channel and multi-channel audio, demonstrating that multi-channel audio inputs significantly enhance model robustness to environmental noise and improve discrimination between device-directed and background speech. Our results highlight the critical importance of spatial audio cues for context-aware voice assistants and establish WearVox as a comprehensive testbed for advancing wearable voice AI research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86WearVox\uff0c\u9996\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\uff08\u5982AI\u773c\u955c\uff09\u8bed\u97f3\u52a9\u624b\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u6db5\u76d65\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u30013842\u6761\u591a\u901a\u9053\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u97f3\u9891\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u73b0\u6709SLLM\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5608\u6742\u6237\u5916\u73af\u5883\uff1b\u591a\u901a\u9053\u97f3\u9891\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6307\u4ee4\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u97f3\u57fa\u51c6\u5ffd\u89c6\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u7279\u6709\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5982\u8fd0\u52a8\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u81ea\u4e2d\u5fc3\u97f3\u9891\u5931\u771f\u3001\u5fae\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u8bbe\u5907\u5b9a\u5411\u8bed\u97f3\u4e0e\u80cc\u666f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u533a\u5206\u96be\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaWearVox\u57fa\u51c6\uff1a\u91c7\u96c63842\u6bb5\u591a\u901a\u9053\u3001\u81ea\u4e2d\u5fc3\u97f3\u9891\uff0c\u8986\u76d65\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u641c\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u95ee\u7b54\u3001\u95ed\u5377\u95ee\u7b54\u3001\u65c1\u542c\u62d2\u7edd\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u3001\u8bed\u97f3\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff09\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u5ba4\u5185\u5916\u591a\u79cd\u58f0\u5b66\u73af\u5883\uff1b\u914d\u5957\u4e30\u5bcc\u5143\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3b\u6d41SLLM\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u5c55\u5355/\u591a\u901a\u9053\u97f3\u9891\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u4e3b\u6d41\u5b9e\u65f6SLLM\u5728WearVox\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ec529%\u201359%\uff0c\u6237\u5916\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u591a\u901a\u9053\u8f93\u5165\u76f8\u8f83\u5355\u901a\u9053\u660e\u663e\u63d0\u5347\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u53ca\u8bbe\u5907\u5b9a\u5411\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7a7a\u95f4\u97f3\u9891\u7ebf\u7d22\u5bf9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u578b\u8bed\u97f3\u52a9\u624b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff1bWearVox\u4e3a\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bed\u97f3AI\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u8bc4\u6d4b\u5e73\u53f0\u3002"}}

They have achieved striking progress, but almost all of this progress lives in virtual spaces. These systems transform embeddings and tokens, yet do not themselves touch the world and rarely admit a physical interpretation. In this work we propose a physical transformer that couples modern transformer style computation with geometric representation and physical dynamics. At the micro level, attention heads, and feed-forward blocks are modeled as interacting spins governed by effective Hamiltonians plus non-Hamiltonian bath terms. At the meso level, their aggregated state evolves on a learned Neural Differential Manifold (NDM) under Hamiltonian flows and Hamilton, Jacobi, Bellman (HJB) optimal control, discretized by symplectic layers that approximately preserve geometric and energetic invariants. At the macro level, the model maintains a generative semantic workspace and a two-dimensional information-phase portrait that tracks uncertainty and information gain over a reasoning trajectory. Within this hierarchy, reasoning tasks are formulated as controlled information flows on the manifold, with solutions corresponding to low cost trajectories that satisfy geometric, energetic, and workspace-consistency constraints. On simple toy problems involving numerical integration and dynamical systems, the physical transformer outperforms naive baselines in stability and long-horizon accuracy, highlighting the benefits of respecting underlying geometric and Hamiltonian structure.

Prevailing ranking models often rely on fragmented modules and hand-crafted features, limiting their ability to interpret complex user intent. This challenge is further amplified in location-based services such as food delivery, where user decisions are shaped by dynamic spatial, temporal, and individual contexts. To address these limitations, we propose a novel generative framework that reframes ranking as a context comprehension task, modeling heterogeneous signals in a unified architecture. Our architecture consists of two core components: the Generative Contextual Encoder (GCE) and the Generative Contextual Fusion (GCF). The GCE comprises three specialized modules: a Personalized Context Enhancer (PCE) for user-specific modeling, a Collective Context Enhancer (CCE) for group-level patterns, and a Dynamic Context Enhancer (DCE) for real-time situational adaptation. The GCF module then seamlessly integrates these contextual representations through low-rank adaptation. Extensive experiments confirm that our method achieves significant gains in critical business metrics, including click-through rate and platform revenue. We have successfully deployed our method on a large-scale food delivery advertising platform, demonstrating its substantial practical impact.

The aim of this study is twofold: (1) developing a realistic model that can be used as a tool for designing pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, and (2) verifying a social science theory using a model with sufficient data. The investigation of the pedestrian model shows that despite simple individual behavior patterns, complex spatial and temporal structures emerge through the interactions in pedestrian flows. Collective behavior emerges from individuals following two basic rules: (1) moving directly towards their goal at a certain speed, and (2) maintaining a distance to other pedestrians and obstacles. This self-organized collective behavior manifests itself as trails that are formed by pedestrians moving in one direction. Furthermore, strong dependencies of the properties of pedestrian flows on geometric forms of buildings are shown, and the influence of geometric changes on performance characteristics is investigated. An example demonstrates how efficiency can be increased by reducing walkable areas. This work also presents an evolutionary algorithm for optimizing building layouts based on the social force model. Additionally, a decision-making model is integrated to describe alternative goal selection, and adaptation and learning capabilities are included to improve pedestrian avoidance behavior and decision strategies based on accumulated experience. A method for determining load distributions in individual sections of a path system considering subjective selection criteria is also developed. Finally, a model that describes the self-organization of path systems with minimal detours is presented, similar to natural transport networks where total length and material costs are optimized.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u57fa\u4e8e\u793e\u4f1a\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5fae\u89c2\u884c\u4eba\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u884c\u4eba\u53cb\u597d\u578b\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u4e2a\u4f53\u89c4\u5219\uff08\u671d\u76ee\u6807\u79fb\u52a8\u3001\u907f\u8ba9\u4ed6\u4eba\u4e0e\u969c\u788d\uff09\u6d8c\u73b0\u51fa\u590d\u6742\u96c6\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\uff08\u5982\u8def\u5f84\u75d5\u8ff9\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u5efa\u7b51\u5e03\u5c40\u3001\u5f15\u5165\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u907f\u8ba9\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7ed5\u884c\u7684\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8def\u5f84\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u884c\u4eba\u53cb\u597d\u578b\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u8db3\u591f\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u793e\u4f1a\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u793e\u4f1a\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u6784\u5efa\u5fae\u89c2\u884c\u4eba\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u6761\u57fa\u672c\u4e2a\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u89c4\u5219\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u5efa\u7b51\u5e03\u5c40\uff1b\u96c6\u6210\u51b3\u7b56\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u8def\u5f84\u7cfb\u7edf\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5206\u5e03\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u6700\u5c0f\u7ed5\u884c\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8def\u5f84\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u7b80\u5355\u4e2a\u4f53\u89c4\u5219\u53ef\u5bfc\u81f4\u590d\u6742\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u96c6\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\uff08\u5982\u5355\u5411\u8def\u5f84\u75d5\u8ff9\uff09\uff1b\u63ed\u793a\u884c\u4eba\u6d41\u7279\u6027\u5bf9\u5efa\u7b51\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u6001\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff1b\u8bc1\u660e\u7f29\u51cf\u53ef\u884c\u8d70\u533a\u57df\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u907f\u8ba9\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u4f18\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u793e\u4f1a\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8def\u5f84\u6a21\u578b\u7c7b\u6bd4\u81ea\u7136\u8fd0\u8f93\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5728\u603b\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6750\u6599\u6210\u672c\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Existing approaches either retain full interaction histories via passive context extension, leading to substantial redundancy, or rely on iterative reasoning to filter noise, incurring high token costs. To address this challenge, we introduce SimpleMem, an efficient memory framework based on semantic lossless compression. We propose a three-stage pipeline designed to maximize information density and token utilization: (1) \\textit{Semantic Structured Compression}, which applies entropy-aware filtering to distill unstructured interactions into compact, multi-view indexed memory units; (2) \\textit{Recursive Memory Consolidation}, an asynchronous process that integrates related units into higher-level abstract representations to reduce redundancy; and (3) \\textit{Adaptive Query-Aware Retrieval}, which dynamically adjusts retrieval scope based on query complexity to construct precise context efficiently. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method consistently outperforms baseline approaches in accuracy, retrieval efficiency, and inference cost, achieving an average F1 improvement of 26.4% while reducing inference-time token consumption by up to 30-fold, demonstrating a superior balance between performance and efficiency.

Traditional physical world models (PWM) focus on quantifiable physical attributes such as space and motion, failing to meet the needs of social intelligence modeling. In contrast, the Mental World Model (MWM), as a structured representation of humans' internal mental states, has become the critical cognitive foundation for embodied agents to achieve natural human-machine collaboration and dynamic social adaptation. However, current MWM research faces significant bottlenecks: such as fragmented conceptual framework with vague boundaries between MWM and PWM, disjointed reasoning mechanisms for the technical pathways and applicable scenarios of different Theory of Mind (ToM) reasoning paradigms, and detachment between evaluation and practice.\n  To address these issues, this review systematically synthesizes over 100 authoritative studies to provide a comprehensive overview of MWM research for embodied AI. Its core contributions are threefold: First, it constructs a complete theoretical framework for MWM for the first time. Specifically, it distinguishes the essential differences between MWM and PWMs. Second, it systematically defines the key components of MWM through two paradigms for mental element representation. Third, it comprehensively analyzes two core ToM reasoning paradigms with 19 ToM methods. Finally, it also clarifies the integration trend of neuro-symbolic hybrid architectures, and synthesizes 26 ToM evaluation benchmarks. This work aims to promote the integration of embodied agents into human society and advance the in-depth development of human-machine collaborative interaction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u5177\u8eabAI\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff08MWM\uff09\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u7684MWM\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u5176\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff08PWM\uff09\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u533a\u522b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86MWM\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u6838\u5fc3\u5fc3\u667a\u7406\u8bba\uff08ToM\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\u53ca19\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u68b3\u7406\u4e8626\u4e2aToM\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u878d\u5408\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5177\u8eabAI\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u4ea4\u4e92\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff08PWM\uff09\u96be\u4ee5\u652f\u6491\u793e\u4f1a\u667a\u80fd\u5efa\u6a21\uff1b\u5f53\u524d\u5fc3\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff08MWM\uff09\u7814\u7a76\u5b58\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u5272\u88c2\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u8131\u8282\u7b49\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u7efc\u8ff0100\u4f59\u7bc7\u6743\u5a01\u6587\u732e\uff0c\u6784\u5efaMWM\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u533a\u5206MWM\u4e0ePWM\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u5fc3\u667a\u8981\u7d20\u8868\u5f81\u8303\u5f0f\u4ee5\u5b9a\u4e49MWM\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1b\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\u4e24\u7c7bToM\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\u53ca19\u79cd\u5177\u4f53\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u68b3\u740626\u4e2aToM\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u878d\u5408\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002", "result": "\u9996\u6b21\u5efa\u7acb\u5b8c\u6574\u7684MWM\u7406\u8bba\u4f53\u7cfb\uff1b\u660e\u786eMWM\u4e0ePWM\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b\u7cfb\u7edf\u754c\u5b9aMWM\u6838\u5fc3\u6784\u6210\uff1b\u5f52\u7eb319\u79cdToM\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e26\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff1b\u6307\u51fa\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u6df7\u5408\u662f\u91cd\u8981\u53d1\u5c55\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e3a\u5177\u8eabAI\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u5316\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8ba4\u77e5\u57fa\u7840\u4e0e\u6280\u672f\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u63a8\u52a8\u5177\u8eab\u4ee3\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u878d\u5165\u4eba\u7c7b\u793e\u4f1a\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u7136\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u3002"}}

On the BraTS (MRI), VinDr-CXR (chest X-ray), and SIIM-COVID-19 (chest X-ray) datasets, we achieve accuracies of 92\\%, 76\\%, and 62\\%, respectively, consistently outperforming non-guided baselines across all datasets.

Among these, software development is one of the key areas where LLMs are increasingly adopted. However, when hardware constraints are considered-for instance, in physical computing, where software must interact with and control physical hardware -their effectiveness has not been fully explored. To address this gap, we introduce \\textsc{PCEval} (Physical Computing Evaluation), the first benchmark in physical computing that enables a fully automatic evaluation of the capabilities of LLM in both the logical and physical aspects of the projects, without requiring human assessment. Our evaluation framework assesses LLMs in generating circuits and producing compatible code across varying levels of project complexity. Through comprehensive testing of 13 leading models, \\textsc{PCEval} provides the first reproducible and automatically validated empirical assessment of LLMs' ability to reason about fundamental hardware implementation constraints within a simulation environment. Our findings reveal that while LLMs perform well in code generation and logical circuit design, they struggle significantly with physical breadboard layout creation, particularly in managing proper pin connections and avoiding circuit errors. \\textsc{PCEval} advances our understanding of AI assistance in hardware-dependent computing environments and establishes a foundation for developing more effective tools to support physical computing education.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u7269\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6PCEval\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u6d4b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eLLMs\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u7535\u8def\u751f\u6210\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9762\u5305\u677f\u7269\u7406\u5e03\u7ebf\uff08\u5982\u5f15\u811a\u8fde\u63a5\u3001\u907f\u514d\u77ed\u8def\u7b49\uff09\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u7eaf\u8f6f\u4ef6\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u5728\u9700\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u786c\u4ef6\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u7269\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\uff08\u5982\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u5f00\u53d1\u3001\u521b\u5ba2\u6559\u80b2\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5c1a\u672a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u7f3a\u4e4f\u517c\u987e\u903b\u8f91\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaPCEval\u57fa\u51c6\uff1a\u5305\u542b\u591a\u5c42\u7ea7\u7269\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u9879\u76ee\uff08\u4ece\u7b80\u5355LED\u63a7\u5236\u5230\u590d\u6742\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7cfb\u7edf\uff09\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u52a8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7535\u8def\u56fe\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u53ca\u9762\u5305\u677f\u5e03\u5c40\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff1b\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5bf913\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u7535\u8def\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7269\u7406\u9762\u5305\u677f\u5e03\u5c40\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u5f15\u811a\u51b2\u7a81\u3001\u7535\u6e90/\u5730\u7ebf\u8fde\u63a5\u548c\u4fe1\u53f7\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u7b49\u786c\u4ef6\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5728\u7269\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u5173\u952e\u77ed\u677f\uff0cPCEval\u4e3a\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u3001\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u63d0\u5347AI\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u6559\u80b2\u4e0e\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u6307\u660e\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Real websites are non-stationary and diverse, making artificial or small-scale task sets insufficient for robust policy learning. WebGym contains nearly 300,000 tasks with rubric-based evaluations across diverse, real-world websites and difficulty levels. We train agents with a simple reinforcement learning (RL) recipe, which trains on the agent's own interaction traces (rollouts), using task rewards as feedback to guide learning. To enable scaling RL, we speed up sampling of trajectories in WebGym by developing a high-throughput asynchronous rollout system, designed specifically for web agents. Our system achieves a 4-5x rollout speedup compared to naive implementations. Second, we scale the task set breadth, depth, and size, which results in continued performance improvement. Fine-tuning a strong base vision-language model, Qwen-3-VL-8B-Instruct, on WebGym results in an improvement in success rate on an out-of-distribution test set from 26.2% to 42.9%, significantly outperforming agents based on proprietary models such as GPT-4o and GPT-5-Thinking that achieve 27.1% and 29.8%, respectively.

This study examines how the introduction of AI-generated reviews influences RS performance and business outcomes. We analyze two distinct pathways through which AI content can enter RSes: user-centric, in which individuals use AI tools to refine their reviews, and platform-centric, in which platforms generate synthetic reviews directly from structured metadata. Using a large-scale dataset of hotel reviews from TripAdvisor, we generate synthetic reviews using LLMs and evaluate their impact across the training and deployment phases of RSes. We find that AI-generated reviews differ systematically from human-authored reviews across multiple textual dimensions. Although both user- and platform-centric AI reviews enhance RS performance relative to models without textual data, models trained on human reviews consistently achieve superior performance, underscoring the quality of authentic human data. Human-trained models generalize robustly to AI content, whereas AI-trained models underperform on both content types. Furthermore, tone-based framing strategies (encouraging, constructive, or critical) substantially enhance platform-generated review effectiveness. Our findings highlight the strategic importance of platform control in governing the generation and integration of AI-generated reviews, ensuring that synthetic content complements recommendation robustness and sustainable business value.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86AI\u751f\u6210\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08RS\uff09\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5546\u4e1a\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u64b0\u5199\u7684\u8bc4\u8bba\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\u4ecd\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u53ef\u66ff\u4ee3\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u800cAI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bc4\u8bba\u867d\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u65e0\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u8d85\u8d8a\u4eba\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5e73\u53f0\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684AI\u8bc4\u8bba\u82e5\u91c7\u7528\u5408\u9002\u7684\u8bed\u6c14\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982\u9f13\u52b1\u6027\u3001\u5efa\u8bbe\u6027\u6216\u6279\u5224\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5174\u8d77\u4f7f\u5f97\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u9762\u4e34AI\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u64b0\u5199\u5185\u5bb9\u5171\u5b58\u7684\u5c40\u9762\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7406\u89e3AI\u751f\u6210\u8bc4\u8bba\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u53ca\u5546\u4e1a\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eTripAdvisor\u9152\u5e97\u8bc4\u8bba\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u8bc4\u8bba\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u7528\u6237\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff08\u7528\u6237\u7528AI\u6da6\u8272\u81ea\u8eab\u8bc4\u8bba\uff09\u548c\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff08\u5e73\u53f0\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5143\u6570\u636e\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u8bc4\u8bba\uff09\u4e24\u79cdAI\u5185\u5bb9\u5f15\u5165\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u90e8\u7f72\u9636\u6bb5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "AI\u751f\u6210\u8bc4\u8bba\u5728\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u533a\u522b\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u8bba\uff1b\u4e24\u7c7bAI\u8bc4\u8bba\u5747\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u65e0\u6587\u672c\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u8bba\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u59cb\u7ec8\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff1b\u4eba\u5de5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9AI\u5185\u5bb9\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\uff0c\u800cAI\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e24\u7c7b\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\uff1b\u8bed\u6c14\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u9f13\u52b1/\u5efa\u8bbe/\u6279\u5224\uff09\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5e73\u53f0\u751f\u6210\u8bc4\u8bba\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4eba\u5de5\u5185\u5bb9\u8d28\u91cf\u4ecd\u662f\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9ec4\u91d1\u6807\u51c6\uff1b\u5e73\u53f0\u5e94\u4e3b\u52a8\u7ba1\u63a7AI\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u6574\u5408\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u5176\u589e\u5f3a\u800c\u975e\u524a\u5f31\u63a8\u8350\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u957f\u671f\u5546\u4e1a\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

However, this success is shadowed by prohibitive economic costs and severe latency, exposing a critical, yet underexplored, trade-off. We formalize this challenge as the \\textbf{Agent System Trilemma}: the inherent tension among achieving state-of-the-art performance, minimizing monetary cost, and ensuring rapid task completion. To dismantle this trilemma, we introduce EvoRoute, a self-evolving model routing paradigm that transcends static, pre-defined model assignments. Leveraging an ever-expanding knowledge base of prior experience, EvoRoute dynamically selects Pareto-optimal LLM backbones at each step, balancing accuracy, efficiency, and resource use, while continually refining its own selection policy through environment feedback. Experiments on challenging agentic benchmarks such as GAIA and BrowseComp+ demonstrate that EvoRoute, when integrated into off-the-shelf agentic systems, not only sustains or enhances system performance but also reduces execution cost by up to $80\\%$ and latency by over $70\\%$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faEvoRoute\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8def\u7531\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u4ee3\u7406AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e09\u96be\u56f0\u5883\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u7684LLM\u4e3b\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0cEvoRoute\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u751a\u81f3\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\uff08\u6700\u9ad880%\uff09\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff08\u8d8570%\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u590d\u6742\u4ee3\u7406AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u867d\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u9ad8\u6602\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6210\u672c\u548c\u4e25\u91cd\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u4e09\u96be\u56f0\u5883\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEvoRoute\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18LLM\u4e3b\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u73af\u5883\u53cd\u9988\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u5316\u8def\u7531\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u81ea\u6f14\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u8def\u7531\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728GAIA\u548cBrowseComp+\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cEvoRoute\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u540e\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u964d\u53cd\u5347\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u6700\u591a80%\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u8d8570%\u3002", "conclusion": "EvoRoute\u6709\u6548\u7834\u89e3\u4e86\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e09\u96be\u56f0\u5883\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

For more information visit https://orchestral-ai.com", "summary": "The rapid proliferation of LLM agent frameworks has forced developers to choose between vendor lock-in through provider-specific SDKs and complex multi-package ecosystems that obscure control flow and hinder reproducibility. Integrating tool calling across multiple LLM providers remains a core engineering challenge due to fragmented APIs, incompatible message formats, and inconsistent streaming and tool-calling behavior, making it difficult to build portable, reliable agent systems. We introduce Orchestral, a lightweight Python framework that provides a unified, type-safe interface for building LLM agents across major providers while preserving the simplicity required for scientific computing and production deployment. Orchestral defines a single universal representation for messages, tools, and LLM usage that operates seamlessly across providers, eliminating manual format translation and reducing framework-induced complexity. Automatic tool schema generation from Python type hints removes the need for handwritten descriptors while maintaining type safety across provider boundaries. A synchronous execution model with streaming support enables deterministic behavior, straightforward debugging, and real-time interaction without introducing server dependencies. The framework's modular architecture cleanly separates provider integration, tool execution, conversation orchestration, and user-facing interfaces, enabling extensibility without architectural entanglement. Orchestral supports advanced agent capabilities found in larger frameworks, including rich tool calling, context compaction, workspace sandboxing, user approval workflows, sub-agents, memory management, and MCP integration.", "AI": {"tldr": "Orchestral \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7 Python \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u591a LLM \u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u7c7b\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6784\u5efa\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3001\u683c\u5f0f\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u548c\u53ef\u79fb\u690d\u6027\u5dee\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709 LLM \u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u5b58\u5728\u5382\u5546\u9501\u5b9a\u3001\u591a\u5305\u751f\u6001\u590d\u6742\u3001API \u548c\u6d88\u606f\u683c\u5f0f\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u53ef\u79fb\u690d\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6d88\u606f/\u5de5\u5177/LLM \u4f7f\u7528\u62bd\u8c61\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e Python \u7c7b\u578b\u63d0\u793a\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u5de5\u5177 schema\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u540c\u6b65\u6267\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u652f\u6301\u6d41\u5f0f\u54cd\u5e94\uff1b\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u67b6\u6784\u5206\u79bb provider\u3001tool\u3001orchestration \u548c interface \u5c42\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8de8\u4e3b\u6d41 LLM \u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\uff08\u5982 OpenAI\u3001Anthropic \u7b49\uff09\u7684\u65e0\u7f1d\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\uff1b\u652f\u6301\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u538b\u7f29\u3001\u6c99\u76d2\u5de5\u4f5c\u533a\u3001\u7528\u6237\u5ba1\u6279\u3001\u5b50\u4ee3\u7406\u3001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7ba1\u7406\u53ca MCP \u96c6\u6210\u7b49\u9ad8\u7ea7\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6846\u67b6\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Orchestral \u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8f7b\u91cf\u4e0e\u7b80\u6d01\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5ab2\u7f8e\u5927\u578b\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u79d1\u7814\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u4e0e\u751f\u4ea7\u90e8\u7f72\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u662f\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u79fb\u690d\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u6613\u8c03\u8bd5 LLM \u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This observation has led researchers towards identifying elementary building blocks of motion known as movement primitives, which are well-suited for generating motor commands in autonomous systems, such as robots. In this survey, we provide an encyclopedic overview of movement primitive approaches and applications in chronological order. Concretely, we present movement primitive frameworks as a way of representing robotic control trajectories acquired through human demonstrations. Within the area of robotics, movement primitives can encode basic motions at the trajectory level, such as how a robot would grasp a cup or the sequence of motions necessary to toss a ball. Furthermore, movement primitives have been developed with the desirable analytical properties of a spring-damper system, probabilistic coupling of multiple demonstrations, using neural networks in high-dimensional systems, and more, to address difficult challenges in robotics. Although movement primitives have widespread application to a variety of fields, the goal of this survey is to inform practitioners on the use of these frameworks in the context of robotics.

Therefore, we propose a novel approach called Modality Interaction and Alignment Representation (MIAR). This network integrates contextual features across different modalities using a feature interaction to generate feature tokens to represent global representations of this modality extracting information from other modalities. These four tokens represent global representations of how each modality extracts information from others. MIAR aligns different modalities using contrastive learning and normalization strategies.

Standard training procedures are primarily based on cross-entropy and focus solely on fluency. Building on RECIPE-NLG, we investigate the use of several composite objectives and present a new topological loss that represents ingredient lists as point clouds in embedding space, minimizing the divergence between predicted and gold ingredients. Using both standard NLG metrics and recipe-specific metrics, we find that our loss significantly improves ingredient- and action-level metrics. Meanwhile, the Dice loss excels in time/temperature precision, and the mixed loss yields competitive trade-offs with synergistic gains in quantity and time.

We adapt Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (\\mhc)~\\citep{xie2025mhc}, recently proposed for Transformers, to graph neural networks. Our method, mHC-GNN, expands node representations across $n$ parallel streams and constrains stream-mixing matrices to the Birkhoff polytope via Sinkhorn-Knopp normalization. We prove that mHC-GNN exhibits exponentially slower over-smoothing (rate $(1-\u03b3)^{L/n}$ vs.\\ $(1-\u03b3)^L$) and can distinguish graphs beyond 1-WL. Experiments on 10 datasets with 4 GNN architectures show consistent improvements. Depth experiments from 2 to 128 layers reveal that standard GNNs collapse to near-random performance beyond 16 layers, while mHC-GNN maintains over 74\\% accuracy even at 128 layers, with improvements exceeding 50 percentage points at extreme depths. Ablations confirm that the manifold constraint is essential: removing it causes up to 82\\% performance degradation.

Recently, platforms such as Amazon and Instagram have begun providing recommendation rationales to users, acknowledging their critical role in fostering trust and enhancing engagement; however, most existing systems still treat them as post-hoc artifacts. We propose an LLM-based recommender (LLM-Rec) that not only predicts items but also generates logically grounded rationales. Our approach leverages a self-annotated rationale dataset and instruction tuning in a rationale-first format, where the model generates an explanation before outputting the recommended item. By adopting this strategy and representing rationales in a chain-of-thought (CoT) style, LLM-Rec strengthens both interpretability and recommendation performance. Experiments on the Fashion and Scientific domains of the Amazon Review dataset demonstrate significant improvements over well-established baselines. To encourage reproducibility and future research, we publicly release a rationale-augmented recommendation dataset containing user histories, rationales, and recommended items.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edfLLM-Rec\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5728\u63a8\u8350\u7269\u54c1\u524d\u5148\u751f\u6210\u903b\u8f91\u4e25\u8c28\u3001\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\uff08CoT\uff09\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u516c\u5f00\u4e86\u5e26\u7406\u7531\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4fa7\u91cd\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u77ed\u671f\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u900f\u660e\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff1b\u5f53\u524d\u5e73\u53f0\u867d\u5f00\u59cb\u63d0\u4f9b\u63a8\u8350\u7406\u7531\uff0c\u4f46\u591a\u4e3a\u4e8b\u540e\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0e\u63a8\u8350\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u6574\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edfLLM-Rec\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u2018\u7406\u7531\u4f18\u5148\u2019\uff08rationale-first\uff09\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u7406\u7531\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5c06\u7406\u7531\u751f\u6210\u7f6e\u4e8e\u7269\u54c1\u9884\u6d4b\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\uff08CoT\uff09\u5f62\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u7406\u7531\u3002", "result": "\u5728Amazon\u8bc4\u8bba\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684Fashion\u548cScientific\u5b50\u9886\u57df\u4e0a\uff0cLLM-Rec\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u8350\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u7406\u7531\u751f\u6210\u6df1\u5ea6\u5d4c\u5165\u63a8\u8350\u6d41\u7a0b\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u7406\u7531\u4f18\u5148+CoT\u7ed3\u6784\uff09\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u4fe1\u6027\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u6240\u53d1\u5e03\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u63a8\u8350\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Despite each modelled language learner starting from a blank slate, the presence of a bottleneck limiting the number of utterances to which the learner is exposed can lead to the emergence of language that lacks ambiguity, is governed by grammatical rules, and is consistent over successive generations, that is, one that is expressive, compositional and stable. The recent introduction of a more computationally tractable and ecologically valid semi supervised iterated learning model, combining supervised and unsupervised learning within an autoencoder architecture, has enabled exploration of language transmission dynamics for much larger meaning-signal spaces. Here, for the first time, the model has been successfully applied to a language learning task involving the communication of much more complex meanings: seven-segment display images. Agents in this model are able to learn and transmit a language that is expressive: distinct codes are employed for all 128 glyphs; compositional: signal components consistently map to meaning components, and stable: the language does not change from generation to generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u8fed\u4ee3\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u4e0e\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e03\u6bb5\u6570\u7801\u7ba1\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u590d\u6742\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u3001\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u8bed\u8a00\u5728\u4ee3\u9645\u4f20\u9012\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4f20\u8f93\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u81ea\u53d1\u5f62\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5982\u65e0\u6b67\u4e49\u6027\u3001\u8bed\u6cd5\u6027\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u5927\u3001\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u610f\u4e49-\u4fe1\u53f7\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e00\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0a\u66f4\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u751f\u6001\u6548\u5ea6\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u8fed\u4ee3\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u5408\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e03\u6bb5\u6570\u7801\u7ba1\uff08128\u79cdglyph\uff09\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u4e60\u5f97\u5e76\u4ee3\u9645\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f20\u9012\u4e00\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\uff1a\u5bf9\u5168\u90e8128\u4e2aglyph\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7f16\u7801\uff08\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u4fe1\u53f7\u6210\u5206\u4e0e\u610f\u4e49\u6210\u5206\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u6620\u5c04\uff08\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u8bed\u8a00\u5728\u591a\u4ee3\u95f4\u4e0d\u53d1\u751f\u6f02\u53d8\uff08\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u8fed\u4ee3\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u590d\u6742\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u6d8c\u73b0\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u7ed3\u6784\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee3\u9645\u5b66\u4e60\u74f6\u9888\u81ea\u7136\u4ea7\u751f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5148\u5929\u8bed\u6cd5\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002"}}

To this end, we focus on a task of translating live-stream chat messages and manually construct LiveChatBench, a benchmark consisting of 1,000 Korean-English parallel sentence pairs. Experiments on five mobile devices demonstrate that, although serving a large and heterogeneous user base requires careful consideration of highly constrained deployment settings and model selection, the proposed approach nevertheless achieves performance comparable to commercial models such as GPT-5.1 on the well-targeted task.

To synergize semantic understanding with dynamic predictive capabilities, we present InternVLA-A1. This model employs a unified Mixture-of-Transformers architecture, coordinating three experts for scene understanding, visual foresight generation, and action execution. These components interact seamlessly through a unified masked self-attention mechanism. Building upon InternVL3 and Qwen3-VL, we instantiate InternVLA-A1 at 2B and 3B parameter scales. We pre-train these models on hybrid synthetic-real datasets spanning InternData-A1 and Agibot-World, covering over 533M frames. This hybrid training strategy effectively harnesses the diversity of synthetic simulation data while minimizing the sim-to-real gap. We evaluated InternVLA-A1 across 12 real-world robotic tasks and simulation benchmark.

Accurately recognizing human emotional states is crucial for facilitating smooth communication between humans and machines. Despite some progress in multimodal sentiment analysis research, numerous challenges remain. The first challenge is the limited and insufficiently rich features extracted from single modality data. Secondly, most studies focus only on the consistency of inter-modal feature information, neglecting the differences between features, resulting in inadequate feature information fusion. In this paper, we first extract multi-channel features to obtain more comprehensive feature information. We employ dual-channel features in both the visual and auditory modalities to enhance intra-modal feature representation. Secondly, we propose a symmetric mutual promotion (SMP) inter-modal feature fusion method. This method combines symmetric cross-modal attention mechanisms and self-attention mechanisms, where the cross-modal attention mechanism captures useful information from other modalities, and the self-attention mechanism models contextual information.

While Best-of-N and self-consistency methods show that aggregating multiple generations can improve performance, existing approaches typically rely on external evaluators, reward models, or exact string-match voting, limiting their applicability and efficiency. We propose Mode Extraction (ModeX), an evaluator-free Best-of-N selection framework that generalizes majority voting to open-ended text generation by identifying the modal output representing the dominant semantic consensus among generated texts. ModeX constructs a similarity graph over candidate generations and recursively applies spectral clustering to select a representative centroid, without requiring additional inference or auxiliary models. We further instantiate this selection principle as ModeX-Lite, an improved version of ModeX with early pruning for efficiency. Across open-ended tasks -- including text summarization, code generation, and mathematical reasoning -- our approaches consistently outperform standard single- and multi-path baselines, providing a computationally efficient solution for robust open-ended text generation.

These models consist of a forward process, which gradually diffuses the data distribution to a noise distribution spanning the whole space, and a backward process, which inverts this transformation to recover the data distribution from noise. Most of the existing literature assumes that the underlying space is Euclidean. However, in many practical applications, the data are constrained to lie on a submanifold of Euclidean space. Addressing this setting, De Bortoli et al. (2022) introduced Riemannian diffusion models and proved that using an exponentially small step size yields a small sampling error in the Wasserstein distance, provided the data distribution is smooth and strictly positive, and the score estimate is $L_\\infty$-accurate. In this paper, we greatly strengthen this theory by establishing that, under $L_2$-accurate score estimate, a {\\em polynomially small stepsize} suffices to guarantee small sampling error in the total variation distance, without requiring smoothness or positivity of the data distribution. Our analysis only requires mild and standard curvature assumptions on the underlying manifold. The main ingredients in our analysis are Li-Yau estimate for the log-gradient of heat kernel, and Minakshisundaram-Pleijel parametrix expansion of the perturbed heat equation.

Retrieval quality is pivotal, yet failures can arise at several stages: understanding user intent, choosing content types, finding candidates (recall), or ranking results. Meanwhile, sending and processing images is costly, making naive multimodal approaches impractical. We present FUSE: Failure-aware Usage of Subagent Evidence for MultiModal Search and Recommendation. FUSE replaces most raw-image prompting with a compact Grounded Design Representation (GDR): a selection aware JSON of canvas elements (image, text, shape, icon, video, logo), structure, styles, salient colors, and user selection provided by the Planner team. FUSE implements seven context budgeting strategies: comprehensive baseline prompting, context compression, chain-of-thought reasoning, mini-shot optimization, retrieval-augmented context, two-stage processing, and zero-shot minimalism. Finally, a pipeline attribution layer monitors system performance by converting subagent signals into simple checks: intent alignment, content-type/routing sanity, recall health (e.g., zero-hit and top-match strength), and ranking displacement analysis. We evaluate the seven context budgeting variants across 788 evaluation queries from diverse users and design templates (refer Figure 3). Our systematic evaluation reveals that Context Compression achieves optimal performance across all pipeline stages, with 93.3% intent accuracy, 86.8% routing success(with fallbacks), 99.4% recall, and 88.5% NDCG@5.

While existing production systems excel at holistic route-level dependency modeling, they struggle to capture city-scale traffic dynamics and long-tail scenarios, leading to unreliable predictions in large urban networks. In this paper, we propose \\model, a scalable and adaptive framework that synergistically integrates link-level modeling with industrial route-level TTE systems. Specifically, we propose a spatio-temporal external attention module to capture global traffic dynamic dependencies across million-scale road networks efficiently. Moreover, we construct a stabilized graph mixture-of-experts network to handle heterogeneous traffic patterns while maintaining inference efficiency. Furthermore, an asynchronous incremental learning strategy is tailored to enable real-time and stable adaptation to dynamic traffic distribution shifts.

Existing work often responds with \"no results\" or relaxes constraints using ad hoc rules, which can violate user intent by discarding requirements the user cares about most. We frame infeasibility handling as a preference-aware query repair problem: when a query is unsatisfiable, the agent should relax the least important constraints to the user. We propose three LLM-based methods for inferring relative constraint importance from dialogue: (1) local weighting, (2) global one-shot weighting, and (3) pairwise ranking. Experiments show local weighting achieves the best preference alignment, while global weighting performs best on correct constraint relaxation.

We formalize these complexities into a new class of problems, dubbed Spatio-Temporal Efficacy-optimized Allocation for Multi-robot systems (STEAM). STEAM builds upon trait-based frameworks that model robots using their capabilities (e.g., payload and speed), but goes beyond the typical binary success-failure model by explicitly modeling the efficacy of allocations as trait-efficacy maps. These maps encode how the aggregated capabilities assigned to a task determine performance. Further, STEAM accommodates spatio-temporal constraints, including a user-specified time budget (i.e., maximum makespan). To solve STEAM problems, we contribute a novel algorithm named Efficacy-optimized Incremental Task Allocation Graph Search (E-ITAGS) that simultaneously optimizes task performance and respects time budgets by interleaving task allocation, scheduling, and path planning. Motivated by the fact that trait-efficacy maps are difficult, if not impossible, to specify, E-ITAGS efficiently learns them using a realizability-aware active learning module. Our approach is realizability-aware since it explicitly accounts for the fact that not all combinations of traits are realizable by the robots available during learning.

Detailed numerical simulations and experiments using an emergency response domain demonstrate that E-ITAGS generates allocations of higher efficacy compared to baselines, while respecting resource and spatio-temporal constraints.

Existing dynamic-depth and layer-skipping methods reduce this cost, but often rely on auxiliary routing mechanisms or incur accuracy degradation when bypassed layers are left uncompensated. We present \\textbf{LoRA-Drop}, a plug-and-play inference framework that accelerates decoding by applying a \\emph{temporal compute schedule} to a fixed subset of intermediate layers: on most decoding steps, selected layers reuse the previous-token hidden state and apply a low-rank LoRA correction, while periodic \\emph{refresh} steps execute the full model to prevent drift. LoRA-Drop requires no routing network, is compatible with standard KV caching, and can reduce KV-cache footprint by skipping KV updates in droppable layers during LoRA steps and refreshing periodically. Across \\textbf{LLaMA2-7B}, \\textbf{LLaMA3-8B}, \\textbf{Qwen2.5-7B}, and \\textbf{Qwen2.5-14B}, LoRA-Drop achieves up to \\textbf{2.6$\\times$ faster decoding} and \\textbf{45--55\\% KV-cache reduction} while staying within \\textbf{0.5 percentage points (pp)} of baseline accuracy.

The classical graph recommendation model utilizes ID embedding to store essential collaborative information. However, this ID-based paradigm faces challenges in transferring to a new domain, making it hard to build a pre-trained graph recommendation model. This phenomenon primarily stems from two inherent challenges: (1) the non-transferability of ID embeddings due to isolated domain-specific ID spaces, and (2) structural incompatibility between heterogeneous interaction graphs across domains.\n  To address these issues, we propose TextBridgeGNN, a pre-training and fine-tuning framework that can effectively transfer knowledge from a pre-trained GNN to downstream tasks. We believe the key lies in how to build the relationship between domains. Specifically, TextBridgeGNN uses text as a semantic bridge to connect domains through multi-level graph propagation. During the pre-training stage, textual information is utilized to break the data islands formed by multiple domains, and hierarchical GNNs are designed to learn both domain-specific and domain-global knowledge with text features, ensuring the retention of collaborative signals and the enhancement of semantics. During the fine-tuning stage, a similarity transfer mechanism is proposed. This mechanism initializes ID embeddings in the target domain by transferring from semantically related nodes, successfully transferring the ID embeddings and graph pattern.\n  Experiments demonstrate that TextBridgeGNN outperforms existing methods in cross-domain, multi-domain, and training-free settings, highlighting its ability to integrate Pre-trained Language Model (PLM)-driven semantics with graph-based collaborative filtering without costly language model fine-tuning or real-time inference overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faTextBridgeGNN\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6587\u672c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8de8\u57df\u8bed\u4e49\u6865\u6881\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ea7\u56fe\u4f20\u64ad\u5b9e\u73b0\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u63a8\u8350\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86ID\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0d\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u548c\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u5f02\u6784\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "ID\u5d4c\u5165\u56e0\u57df\u9694\u79bb\u548c\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u5f02\u6784\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u8de8\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u56fe\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u590d\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTextBridgeGNN\uff1a\u4ee5\u6587\u672c\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u6865\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u7ea7\u56fe\u4f20\u64ad\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08\u878d\u5408\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u57df\u7279\u5f02\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u77e5\u8bc6\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u9636\u6bb5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u8fc1\u79fb\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06\u6e90\u57df\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u8282\u70b9\u7684ID\u5d4c\u5165\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8de8\u57df\u3001\u591a\u57df\u53ca\u514d\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u517c\u987ePLM\u8bed\u4e49\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0e\u56fe\u534f\u540c\u8fc7\u6ee4\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "TextBridgeGNN\u6709\u6548\u6253\u901a\u4e86\u56fe\u63a8\u8350\u4e2dID\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u58c1\u5792\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u56fe\u63a8\u8350\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

We present ReCCur (Recursive Corner-Case Curation), a low-compute framework that converts noisy web imagery into auditable fine-grained labels via a multi-agent recursive pipeline. First, large-scale data acquisition and filtering expands a domain vocabulary with a vision-language model (VLM), crawls the web, and enforces tri-modal (image, description, keyword) consistency with light human spot checks to yield refined candidates. Next, mixture-of-experts knowledge distillation uses complementary encoders (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2, BEiT) for kNN voting with dual-confidence activation and uncertainty sampling, converging to a high-precision set. Finally, region-evidence VLM adversarial labeling pairs a proposer (multi-granularity regions and semantic cues) with a validator (global and local chained consistency) to produce explainable labels and close the loop. On realistic corner-case scenarios (e.g., flooded-car inspection), ReCCur runs on consumer-grade GPUs, steadily improves purity and separability, and requires minimal human supervision, providing a practical substrate for downstream training and evaluation under resource constraints.

A key assumption in these works is that the goal region is reachable; an assumption that often fails in practice when environments are disconnected. Motivated by this limitation, we consider known 3D environments comprising objects, also called blocks, that form distinct navigable support surfaces (planes), and that are either non-movable (e.g., tables) or movable (e.g., boxes). These surfaces may be mutually disconnected due to height differences, holes, or lateral separations. Our focus is on tasks where the robot must reach a goal region residing on an elevated plane that is unreachable. Rather than declaring such tasks infeasible, an effective strategy is to enable the robot to interact with the environment, rearranging movable objects to create new traversable connections; a problem known as Navigation Among Movable Objects (NAMO). Existing NAMO planners typically address 2D environments, where obstacles are pushed aside to clear a path. These methods cannot directly handle the considered 3D setting; in such cases, obstacles must be placed strategically to bridge these physical disconnections. We address this challenge by developing BRiDGE (Block-based Reconfiguration in Disconnected 3D Geometric Environments), a sampling-based planner that incrementally builds trees over robot and object configurations to compute feasible plans specifying which objects to move, where to place them, and in what order, while accounting for a limited number of movable objects. To accelerate planning, we introduce non-uniform sampling strategies. We show that our method is probabilistically complete and we provide extensive numerical and hardware experiments validating its effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faBRiDGE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b33D\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u56e0\u652f\u6301\u9762\u65ad\u5f00\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5230\u8fbe\u76ee\u6807\u533a\u57df\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u6392\u53ef\u52a8\u7269\u4f53\uff08\u5982\u7bb1\u5b50\uff09\u6765\u642d\u5efa\u8fde\u63a5\u6865\u6881\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u5047\u8bbe\u76ee\u6807\u533a\u57df\u53ef\u8fbe\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u96453D\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u56e0\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5dee\u3001\u7a7a\u6d1e\u6216\u6a2a\u5411\u5206\u79bb\u5bfc\u81f4\u652f\u6301\u9762\u65ad\u5f00\uff0c\u4f7f\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u53ef\u8fbe\uff1b\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\uff08\u91cd\u6392\u53ef\u52a8\u7269\u4f53\uff09\u6765\u5efa\u7acb\u65b0\u901a\u8def\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBRiDGE\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff0c\u589e\u91cf\u6784\u5efa\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0e\u7269\u4f53\u8054\u5408\u6784\u578b\u6811\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9009\u62e9\u79fb\u52a8\u54ea\u4e9b\u7269\u4f53\u3001\u653e\u7f6e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u53ca\u987a\u5e8f\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u975e\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u52a0\u901f\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6982\u7387\u5b8c\u5907\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u503c\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u786c\u4ef6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86BRiDGE\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u884c\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u57283D\u65ad\u8fde\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bfc\u822a\u4e0e\u7269\u4f53\u91cd\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "conclusion": "BRiDGE\u6709\u6548\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86NAMO\u95ee\u9898\u81f33D\u51e0\u4f55\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf2D\u63a8\u52a8\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u81ea\u4e3b\u642d\u5efa\u901a\u8def\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

While fact-checking can mitigate these errors, existing methods typically retrieve external evidence indiscriminately, overlooking the model's internal knowledge and potentially introducing irrelevant noise. Moreover, current systems lack targeted mechanisms to resolve specific uncertainties in the model's reasoning. Inspired by how humans fact-check, we argue that LLMs should adaptively decide whether to rely on internal knowledge or initiate retrieval based on their confidence in a given claim. We introduce Probabilistic Certainty and Consistency (PCC), a framework that estimates factual confidence by jointly modeling an LLM's probabilistic certainty and reasoning consistency. These confidence signals enable an adaptive verification strategy: the model answers directly when confident, triggers targeted retrieval when uncertain or inconsistent, and escalates to deep search when ambiguity is high. Our confidence-guided routing mechanism ensures that retrieval is invoked only when necessary, improving both efficiency and reliability. Extensive experiments across three challenging benchmarks show that PCC achieves better uncertainty quantification than verbalized confidence and consistently outperforms strong LLM-based fact-checking baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PCC generalizes well across various LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPCC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6982\u7387\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u51b3\u5b9a\u662f\u5426\u4f9d\u8d56\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u89e6\u53d1\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u7d22\u6216\u5347\u7ea7\u6df1\u5ea6\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u52a0\u533a\u5206\u5730\u68c0\u7d22\u5916\u90e8\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u5165\u65e0\u5173\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9488\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7279\u5b9a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6982\u7387\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08PCC\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21LLM\u7684\u6982\u7387\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4ee5\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cPCC\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u53e3\u5934\u5316\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u6301\u7eed\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f3aLLM\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u8de8\u591a\u79cdLLM\u7684\u826f\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "PCC\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5185\u90e8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u68c0\u7d22\u6709\u673a\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u53ef\u4fe1\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

While Multi-gate Mixture-of-Experts (MMOE) thrives in ranking, its transfer to the matching stage is hindered by the blind optimization inherent to independent two-tower architectures and the parameter dominance of head scenarios. To address these structural and distributional bottlenecks, we propose Distillation-based Scenario-Adaptive Mixture-of-Experts (DSMOE).

Common remedies such as context compression or retrieval-augmented prompting introduce trade-offs between information fidelity and reasoning stability. We present InfiAgent, a general-purpose framework that keeps the agent's reasoning context strictly bounded regardless of task duration by externalizing persistent state into a file-centric state abstraction. At each step, the agent reconstructs context from a workspace state snapshot plus a fixed window of recent actions. Experiments on DeepResearch and an 80-paper literature review task show that, without task-specific fine-tuning, InfiAgent with a 20B open-source model is competitive with larger proprietary systems and maintains substantially higher long-horizon coverage than context-centric baselines. These results support explicit state externalization as a practical foundation for stable long-horizon agents.

This principle is equally critical in prompt engineering, where designing effective prompts for large language models constitutes a complex optimization challenge. A structured optimization approach requires automated or semi-automated procedures to develop improved prompts, thereby reducing manual effort, improving performance, and yielding an interpretable process. However, current prompt optimization methods often induce prompt drift, where new prompts fix prior failures but impair performance on previously successful tasks. Additionally, generating prompts from scratch can compromise interpretability. To address these limitations, this study proposes the Hierarchical Attribution Prompt Optimization (HAPO) framework, which introduces three innovations: (1) a dynamic attribution mechanism targeting error patterns in training data and prompting history, (2) semantic-unit optimization for editing functional prompt segments, and (3) multimodal-friendly progression supporting both end-to-end LLM and LLM-MLLM workflows.

While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has shown strong performance, it often fails to adapt to real-world short-term distribution shifts, which arise as different batches of goods arrive sequentially, causing performance drops. We argue that the short-term lookahead information available in modern logistics systems is key to mitigating this issue, especially during distribution shifts. We formulate online 3D-BP with lookahead parcels as a Model Predictive Control (MPC) problem and adapt the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework to solve it.

Pruning has emerged as a promising direction for reducing ViT complexity. However, existing approaches either (i) produce a single pruned model shared across all devices, ignoring device heterogeneity, or (ii) rely on fine-tuning with device-local data, which is often infeasible due to limited on-device resources and strict privacy constraints. As a result, current methods fall short of enabling task-customized ViT pruning in privacy-preserving mobile computing settings. This paper introduces TAP-ViTs, a novel task-adaptive pruning framework that generates device-specific pruned ViT models without requiring access to any raw local data. Specifically, to infer device-level task characteristics under privacy constraints, we propose a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based metric dataset construction mechanism. Each device fits a lightweight GMM to approximate its private data distribution and uploads only the GMM parameters. Using these parameters, the cloud selects distribution-consistent samples from public data to construct a task-representative metric dataset for each device. Based on this proxy dataset, we further develop a dual-granularity importance evaluation-based pruning strategy that jointly measures composite neuron importance and adaptive layer importance, enabling fine-grained, task-aware pruning tailored to each device's computational budget. Extensive experiments across multiple ViT backbones and datasets demonstrate that TAP-ViTs consistently outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods under comparable compression ratios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faTAP-ViTs\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u539f\u59cb\u672c\u5730\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u81ea\u9002\u5e94ViT\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7GMM\u5efa\u6a21\u79c1\u6709\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u6784\u5efa\u4ee3\u7406\u5ea6\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53cc\u7c92\u5ea6\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u6027\u4e0e\u8bbe\u5907\u7b97\u529b\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709ViT\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u517c\u987e\u8bbe\u5907\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u4e0e\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u9700\u6c42\uff1a\u8981\u4e48\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u526a\u679d\u6a21\u578b\u5ffd\u7565\u8bbe\u5907\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u672c\u5730\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u800c\u540e\u8005\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0e\u9690\u79c1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTAP-ViTs\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5404\u8bbe\u5907\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff08GMM\uff09\u8fd1\u4f3c\u672c\u5730\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u5e76\u4e0a\u4f20\u53c2\u6570\uff1b2\uff09\u4e91\u7aef\u57fa\u4e8eGMM\u53c2\u6570\u4ece\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u9009\u53d6\u5206\u5e03\u4e00\u81f4\u6837\u672c\u6784\u5efa\u8bbe\u5907\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\u4ee3\u8868\u5ea6\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b3\uff09\u5728\u6b64\u4ee3\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u878d\u5408\u590d\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5c42\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u7684\u53cc\u7c92\u5ea6\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aViT\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTAP-ViTs\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "TAP-ViTs\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u8bbe\u5907\u5b9a\u5236\u5316ViT\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8fb9\u7f18\u573a\u666f\u90e8\u7f72\u9ad8\u6027\u80fdViT\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Here we introduce DataParasite, an open-source, modular pipeline for scalable online data collection. DataParasite decomposes tabular curation tasks into independent, entity-level searches defined through lightweight configuration files and executed through a shared, task-agnostic python script. Crucially, the same pipeline can be repurposed to new tasks, including those without predefined entity lists, using only natural-language instructions. We evaluate the pipeline on multiple canonical tasks in computational social science, including faculty hiring histories, elite death events, and political career trajectories. Across tasks, DataParasite achieves high accuracy while reducing data-collection costs by an order of magnitude relative to manual curation.

However, time series anomaly detection often suffers from sparse labels, complex temporal patterns, and costly expert annotation. We propose a unified framework that integrates Large Language Model (LLM)-based potential functions for reward shaping with Reinforcement Learning (RL), Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-enhanced dynamic reward scaling, and active learning with label propagation. An LSTM-based RL agent leverages LLM-derived semantic rewards to guide exploration, while VAE reconstruction errors add unsupervised anomaly signals.

Conventional approaches often struggle with ambiguity, lexicon inconsistencies, and limited contextual understanding, particularly in multi-source news environments. Existing models typically treat sentiment as a secondary feature, reducing their ability to adapt to users' affective preferences. To address these limitations, this study develops an adaptive, sentiment-aware news recommendation framework by integrating hybrid sentiment analysis with reinforcement learning. Using the BBC News dataset, a hybrid sentiment model combines VADER, AFINN, TextBlob, and SentiWordNet scores to generate robust article-level sentiment estimates. Articles are categorised as positive, negative, or neutral, and these sentiment states are embedded within a Q-learning architecture to guide the agent in learning optimal recommendation policies. The proposed system effectively identifies and recommends articles with aligned emotional profiles while continuously improving personalisation through iterative Q-learning updates. The results demonstrate that coupling hybrid sentiment modelling with reinforcement learning provides a feasible, interpretable, and adaptive approach for user-centred news recommendation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u6df7\u5408\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u60c5\u611f\u611f\u77e5\u65b0\u95fb\u63a8\u8350\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u63a8\u8350\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b0\u95fb\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6e90\u65b0\u95fb\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u6b67\u4e49\u3001\u8bcd\u5178\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u6709\u9650\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u5e38\u5c06\u60c5\u611f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6b21\u8981\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u7528\u6237\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u504f\u597d\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u6df7\u5408\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u878d\u5408VADER\u3001AFINN\u3001TextBlob\u548cSentiWordNet\uff09\uff0c\u5bf9BBC News\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u6587\u7ae0\u8fdb\u884c\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u7c7b\uff08\u6b63/\u8d1f/\u4e2d\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u60c5\u611f\u72b6\u6001\u5d4c\u5165Q-learning\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a8\u8350\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u63a8\u8350\u7b26\u5408\u7528\u6237\u60c5\u611f\u504f\u597d\u7684\u65b0\u95fb\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3Q-learning\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u5316\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6548\u679c\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5177\u5907\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u6df7\u5408\u60c5\u611f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ee5\u7528\u6237\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u65b0\u95fb\u63a8\u8350\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Traditional safety frameworks treat contact as unsafe, restricting robots to collision avoidance and limiting their ability to function in dense, everyday settings. As the number of objects grows, model-based approaches for safe manipulation become computationally intractable; meanwhile, learned methods typically tie safety to the task at hand, making them hard to transfer to new tasks without retraining. In this work we introduce Dense Contact Barrier Functions(DCBF). Our approach bypasses the computational complexity of explicitly modeling multi-object dynamics by instead learning a composable, object-centric function that implicitly captures the safety constraints arising from physical interactions. Trained offline on interactions with a few objects, the learned DCBFcomposes across arbitrary object sets at runtime, producing a single global safety filter that scales linearly and transfers across tasks without retraining. We validate our approach through simulated experiments in dense clutter, demonstrating its ability to enable collision-free navigation and safe, contact-rich interaction in suitable settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDense Contact Barrier Functions (DCBF)\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u3001\u53ef\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5b89\u5168\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u6742\u4e71\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u5b89\u5168\u5bfc\u822a\u4e0e\u63a5\u89e6\u5f0f\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u63a5\u89e6\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u65e5\u5e38\u5bc6\u96c6\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u529f\u80fd\uff1b\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u53c8\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDense Contact Barrier Functions\uff08DCBF\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u5c11\u91cf\u7269\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5b89\u5168\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5bf9\u4efb\u610f\u7269\u4f53\u96c6\u5408\u751f\u6210\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u5b89\u5168\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u6742\u4e71\u73af\u5883\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cDCBF\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u78b0\u649e\u5bfc\u822a\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "conclusion": "DCBF\u7ed5\u8fc7\u4e86\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u591a\u7269\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u8de8\u7269\u4f53\u96c6\u5408\u548c\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5bc6\u96c6\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

This work addresses these questions from an information-flow perspective by comparing existing BIQA models with three paradigms designed to learn the image-text-score relationship: Chain-of-Thought, Self-Consistency, and Autoencoder. Our experiments show that the score prediction performance of the existing model significantly drops when only textual information is used for prediction. Whereas the Chain-of-Thought paradigm introduces little improvement in BIQA performance, the Self-Consistency paradigm significantly reduces the gap between image- and text-conditioned predictions, narrowing the PLCC/SRCC difference to 0.02/0.03. The Autoencoder-like paradigm is less effective in closing the image-text gap, yet it reveals a direction for further optimization. These findings provide insights into how to improve the textual reasoning for BIQA and high-level vision tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u76f2\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08BIQA\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86Chain-of-Thought\u3001Self-Consistency\u548cAutoencoder\u4e09\u79cd\u8303\u5f0f\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c-\u5206\u6570\u5173\u7cfb\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0Self-Consistency\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u5c0f\u4ec5\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u4ec5\u7528\u6587\u672c\u9884\u6d4b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u76f2\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08BIQA\uff09\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u5982\u4f55\u8d21\u732e\u4e8e\u8d28\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6587\u672c\u80fd\u5728\u591a\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8868\u5f81\u4e0e\u8bc4\u5206\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u89c6\u89d2\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e09\u79cd\u5b66\u4e60\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c-\u5206\u6570\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\uff1aChain-of-Thought\u3001Self-Consistency \u548c Autoencoder\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u73b0\u6709BIQA\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u4ec5\u7528\u6587\u672c\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff1bChain-of-Thought\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u9650\uff1bSelf-Consistency\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u5c0f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5dee\u8ddd\uff08PLCC/SRCC\u5dee\u964d\u81f30.02/0.03\uff09\uff1bAutoencoder\u8303\u5f0f\u6548\u679c\u8f83\u5f31\u4f46\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "Self-Consistency\u8303\u5f0f\u66f4\u5229\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u5728BIQA\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u8be5\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347BIQA\u53ca\u9ad8\u5c42\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Leveraging the Qwen-3 dense model series and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we train models to generate responses to multiple choice questions conditioned on discrete ability descriptors. We reconstruct the probability of a correct response as a function of student ability, effectively generating synthetic Item Characteristic Curves (ICCs) to estimate IRT parameters.

For molecular property prediction, SMILES-based NTP scales well but lacks explicit topology, whereas graph-native masked modeling captures connectivity but risks disrupting the pivotal chemical details (e.g., activity cliffs). CamS bridges this gap by serializing molecular graphs into structure-rich causal sequences. CamS first mines data-driven connection-aware motifs. It then serializes motifs via scaffold-rooted breadth-first search (BFS) to establish a stable core-to-periphery order. Crucially, CamS enables hierarchical modeling by concatenating sequences from fine to coarse motif scales, allowing the model to condition global scaffolds on dense, uncorrupted local structural evidence. We instantiate CamS-LLaMA by pre-training a vanilla LLaMA backbone on CamS sequences. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on MoleculeNet and the activity-cliff benchmark MoleculeACE, outperforming both SMILES-based language models and strong graph baselines.

Language relies on problem space search for deep semantic reasoning. While early large language models (LLMs) could generate fluent text, they lacked robust semantic reasoning capabilities. Prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) extended reasoning paths by making intermediate steps explicit. Recent models like DeepSeek-R1 enhanced performance through explicit reasoning trajectories. However, these methods have limitations in search completeness and efficiency.\n  This highlights the need for \"Time-Scaling\"--the systematic extension and optimization of an agent's ability to unfold reasoning over time. Time-Scaling refers to architectural design utilizing extended temporal pathways, enabling deeper problem space exploration, dynamic strategy adjustment, and enhanced metacognitive control, paralleling human sequential reasoning under cognitive constraints. It represents a critical frontier for enhancing deep reasoning and problem-solving without proportional increases in static model parameters. Advancing intelligent agent capabilities requires placing Time-Scaling principles at the forefront, positioning explicit temporal reasoning management as foundational.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u201c\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u653e\u201d\uff08Time-Scaling\uff09\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u6df1\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u7545\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u4ecd\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1bCoT\u3001ToT\u7b49\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u641c\u7d22\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u65f6\u5e8f\u5316\u9010\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5efa\u6a21\u7c7b\u4f3c\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTime-Scaling\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u67b6\u6784\u5c42\u9762\u8bbe\u8ba1\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a2\u7d22\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u7b56\u7565\u8c03\u6574\u4e0e\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u53d7\u8ba4\u77e5\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u786e\u7acbTime-Scaling\u4e3a\u589e\u5f3a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6df1\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u524d\u6cbf\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4e3b\u5f20\u5c06\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u7ba1\u7406\u4f5c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u539f\u5219\u3002", "conclusion": "Time-Scaling\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u7c7b\u4eba\u6df1\u5c42\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e94\u6210\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u8ba4\u77e5\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u9996\u8981\u8003\u91cf\u3002"}}

However, none of these manipulators share exactly the same structure, as the order of joints and the ratio of link lengths differ among robots.

We evaluated MLLM architectures on knee osteoarthritis (OA) radiograph classification, which remains underrepresented in existing medical MLLM benchmarks, even though knee OA affects an estimated 300 to 400 million people worldwide. Through systematic ablation studies manipulating the vision encoder, the connector, and the large language model (LLM) across diverse training strategies, we measured each component's contribution to diagnostic accuracy. In our classification task, a trained vision encoder alone could outperform full MLLM pipelines in classification accuracy and fine-tuning the LLM provided no meaningful improvement over prompt-based guidance. And LoRA fine-tuning on a small, class-balanced dataset (500 images) gave better results than training on a much larger but class-imbalanced set (5,778 images), indicating that data balance and quality can matter more than raw scale for this task. These findings suggest that for domain-specific medical classification, LLMs are more effective as interpreters and report generators rather than as primary classifiers. Therefore, the MLLM architecture appears less suitable for medical image diagnostic classification tasks that demand high certainty. We recommend prioritizing vision encoder optimization and careful dataset curation when developing clinically applicable systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u5728\u819d\u9aa8\u5173\u8282\u708e\uff08OA\uff09X\u5149\u7247\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0d\u5982\u5355\u72ec\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff1bLLM\u5fae\u8c03\u5bf9\u5206\u7c7b\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u800c\u6570\u636e\u5e73\u8861\u6027\u6bd4\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\uff1b\u7ed3\u8bba\u662fMLLM\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u548c\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u9ad8\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u8bca\u65ad\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u819d\u9aa8\u5173\u8282\u708e\u5f71\u54cd\u5168\u74033\u20134\u4ebf\u4eba\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u533b\u5b66MLLM\u57fa\u51c6\u4e2d\u4e25\u91cd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\uff1b\u5f53\u524dMLLM\u5728VQA\u548c\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u80fd\u529b\u96be\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u75be\u75c5\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u64cd\u63a7\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001\u8fde\u63a5\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\u3001LoRA\u3001\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\uff09\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u819dOA X\u5149\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8d21\u732e\uff1b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0e\u5e73\u8861\u6027\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5355\u72ec\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5b8c\u6574MLLM\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1bLLM\u5fae\u8c03\u65e0\u660e\u663e\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u5f0f\u5f15\u5bfc\u5373\u8db3\u591f\uff1b\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u4f46\u7c7b\u522b\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08500\u5f20\uff09\u7ecfLoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff085778\u5f20\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9ad8\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u8bca\u65ad\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0cMLLM\u67b6\u6784\u5e76\u4e0d\u7406\u60f3\uff1bLLM\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u548c\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff1b\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e94\u4f18\u5148\u4f18\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5e76\u5ba1\u614e\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002"}}

Transforming scientific papers into patent descriptions is particularly challenging due to their differing rhetorical styles and stringent legal requirements. Unlike black-box text-to-text approaches that struggle to model structural reasoning and legal constraints, we propose FlowPlan-G2P, a novel framework that mirrors the cognitive workflow of expert drafters by reformulating this task into three stages: (1) Concept Graph Induction, extracting technical entities and relationships into a directed graph via expert-like reasoning; (2) Paragraph and Section Planning, reorganizing the graph into coherent clusters aligned with canonical patent sections; and (3) Graph-Conditioned Generation, producing legally compliant paragraphs using section-specific subgraphs and tailored prompts. Experiments demonstrate that FlowPlan-G2P significantly improves logical coherence and legal compliance over end-to-end LLM baselines. Our framework establishes a new paradigm for paper-to-patent generation and advances structured text generation for specialized domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFlowPlan-G2P\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u79d1\u7814\u8bba\u6587\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e13\u5229\u6587\u672c\u5206\u4e3a\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u6982\u5ff5\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u3001\u6bb5\u843d\u4e0e\u7ae0\u8282\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u56fe\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u903b\u8f91\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u4e0e\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u79d1\u7814\u8bba\u6587\u4e0e\u4e13\u5229\u5728\u4fee\u8f9e\u98ce\u683c\u548c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u8981\u6c42\u4e0a\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9ed1\u7bb1\u5f0f\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFlowPlan-G2P\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a(1) \u6982\u5ff5\u56fe\u5f52\u7eb3\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u4f53\u4e0e\u5173\u7cfb\u6784\u5efa\u6709\u5411\u56fe\uff1b(2) \u6bb5\u843d\u4e0e\u7ae0\u8282\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u5c06\u56fe\u805a\u7c7b\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e13\u5229\u6807\u51c6\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b(3) \u56fe\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b50\u56fe\u4e0e\u5b9a\u5236\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u5408\u89c4\u6bb5\u843d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "FlowPlan-G2P\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u8bba\u6587\u5230\u4e13\u5229\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

We first observe that the model's NCMI is inversely proportional to its accuracy. Building on this insight, we introduce an alternating algorithm to efficiently minimize the NCMI. Across image recognition and whole-slide imaging (WSI) subtyping benchmarks, NCMI-trained models surpass state of the art losses by substantial margins at a computational cost comparable to that of CE. Notably, on ImageNet, NCMI yields a 2.77% top-1 accuracy improvement with ResNet-50 comparing to the CE; on CAMELYON-17, replacing CE with NCMI improves the macro-F1 by 8.6% over the strongest baseline.

While recent Generative Graph Models (e.g., HiGPT, OFA) demonstrate promising semantic capabilities, their prohibitive inference latency (often exceeding 13 minutes per 1,000 requests) and massive computational costs render them practically undeployable for real-time, million-scale applications. To bridge this gap between generative quality and industrial scalability, we propose TAG-HGT, a cost-effective neuro-symbolic framework. Adopting a decoupled \"Semantics-First, Structure-Refined\" paradigm, TAG-HGT utilizes a frozen Large Language Model (DeepSeek-V3) as an offline semantic factory and distills its knowledge into a lightweight Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT) via Cross-View Contrastive Learning (CVCL). We present a key insight: while LLM semantics provide necessary global recall, structural signals offer the critical local discrimination needed to distinguish valid collaborators from semantically similar but socially unreachable strangers in dense embedding spaces. Validated under a strict Time-Machine Protocol on the massive OpenAlex dataset, TAG-HGT achieves a SOTA System Recall@10 of 91.97%, outperforming structure-only baselines by 20.7%. Most significantly, from an industrial perspective, TAG-HGT reduces inference latency by five orders of magnitude ($4.5 \\times 10^{5}\\times$) compared to generative baselines (from 780s down to 1.73 ms), and slashes inference costs from $\\sim$$1.50 to $<$$0.001 per 1k queries.

This chapter examines the emergence of agentic AI systems that integrate planning, memory, tool use, and iterative reasoning to operate autonomously in complex environments. We trace the architectural progression from statistical models to transformer-based systems, identifying capabilities that enable agentic behavior: long-range reasoning, contextual awareness, and adaptive decision-making. The chapter provides three contributions: (1) a synthesis of how LLM capabilities extend toward agency through reasoning-action-reflection loops; (2) an integrative framework describing core components perception, memory, planning, and tool execution that bridge LLMs with autonomous behavior; (3) a critical assessment of applications and persistent challenges in safety, alignment, reliability, and sustainability. Unlike existing surveys, we focus on the architectural transition from language understanding to autonomous action, emphasizing the technical gaps that must be resolved before deployment. We identify critical research priorities, including verifiable planning, scalable multi-agent coordination, persistent memory architectures, and governance frameworks.

We propose a method to improve loop closure performance in DPV-SLAM. Our approach integrates AnyLoc, a learning-based visual place recognition technique, as a replacement for the classical Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) loop detection method. In contrast to BoVW, which relies on handcrafted features, AnyLoc utilizes deep feature representations, enabling more robust image retrieval across diverse viewpoints and lighting conditions. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive mechanism that dynamically adjusts similarity threshold based on environmental conditions, removing the need for manual tuning. Experiments on both indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the original DPV-SLAM in terms of loop closure accuracy and robustness.

Traditional long-range forecasting, whether statistical or dynamical, has predominantly focused on predicting a single, spatially-averaged seasonal value, lacking the spatial detail essential for regional-level resource management. To address this gap, we introduce a novel deep learning framework that reframes gridded monsoon prediction as a spatio-temporal computer vision task. We treat multi-variable, pre-monsoon atmospheric and oceanic fields as a sequence of multi-channel images, effectively creating a video-like input tensor. Using 85 years of ERA5 reanalysis data for predictors and IMD rainfall data for targets, we employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based architecture to learn the complex mapping from the five-month pre-monsoon period (January-May) to a high-resolution gridded rainfall pattern for the subsequent monsoon season. Our framework successfully produces distinct forecasts for each of the four monsoon months (June-September) as well as the total seasonal average, demonstrating its utility for both intra-seasonal and seasonal outlooks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5370\u5ea6\u590f\u5b63\u98ce\uff08ISM\uff09\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u683c\u70b9\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u5927\u6c14\u6d77\u6d0b\u573a\u89c6\u4e3a\u591a\u901a\u9053\u56fe\u50cf\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5229\u7528CNN\u4ece5\u4e2a\u6708\u524d\u5146\u6570\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u5b63\u98ce\u671f\u9010\u6708\u53ca\u5b63\u8282\u603b\u964d\u96e8\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u957f\u671f\u9884\u62a5\u4ec5\u9884\u6d4b\u5355\u4e00\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e73\u5747\u503c\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u533a\u57df\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u5c061936\u20132020\u5e74ERA5\u518d\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\uff08\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\uff09\u548cIMD\u964d\u6c34\u6570\u636e\uff08\u76ee\u6807\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u5f0f\u591a\u901a\u9053\u65f6\u7a7a\u5f20\u91cf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528CNN\u67b6\u6784\u5efa\u6a211\u6708\u20135\u6708\u524d\u5146\u573a\u52306\u6708\u20139\u6708\u9010\u6708\u53ca\u5b63\u8282\u603b\u964d\u6c34\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u6620\u5c04\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u751f\u6210\u56db\u4e2a\u6708\u4efd\uff086\u20139\u6708\uff09\u53ca\u6574\u4e2a\u5b63\u98ce\u671f\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u683c\u70b9\u964d\u6c34\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ec6\u8282\u548c\u65f6\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u5b63\u98ce\u9884\u6d4b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u65f6\u7a7a\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4e3a\u533a\u57df\u6c34\u6587\u4e0e\u519c\u4e1a\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u957f\u7a0b\u9884\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

This study presents a pipeline for developing a lung cancer knowledge base using Open Information Extraction (OpenIE). The process includes: (1) identifying medical concepts with the MeSH thesaurus; (2) filtering open-access PubMed literature with permissive licenses (CC0); (3) extracting (subject, relation, object) triplets using OpenIE method; and (4) enriching triplet sets with Named Entity Recognition (NER) to ensure biomedical relevance.

Existing approaches predominantly aim to infer the diversity of user preferences from observed user feedback. Nonetheless, due to inherent data biases, the observed data may not fully reflect user interests, where underexplored preferences can be overwhelmed or remain unmanifested. Failing to capture these preferences can lead to suboptimal diversity in recommendations. To fill this gap, this work aims to study diversified recommendation from a data-bias perspective. Inspired by the outstanding performance of large language models (LLMs) in zero-shot inference leveraging world knowledge, we propose a novel approach that utilizes LLMs' expertise to uncover underexplored user preferences from observed behavior, ultimately providing diverse and relevant recommendations. To achieve this, we first introduce Tree of Preferences (ToP), an innovative structure constructed to model user preferences from coarse to fine. ToP enables LLMs to systematically reason over the user's rationale behind their behavior, thereby uncovering their underexplored preferences. To guide diversified recommendations using uncovered preferences, we adopt a data-centric approach, identifying candidate items that match user preferences and generating synthetic interactions that reflect underexplored preferences. These interactions are integrated to train a general recommender for diversification. Moreover, we scale up overall efficiency by dynamically selecting influential users during optimization. Extensive evaluations of both diversity and relevance show that our approach outperforms existing methods in most cases and achieves near-optimal performance in others, with reasonable inference latency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u2018\u504f\u597d\u6811\u2019\uff08ToP\uff09\u6765\u6316\u6398\u7528\u6237\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5c55\u73b0\u7684\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6837\u5316\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u7528\u6237\u672a\u663e\u5316\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u8350\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u2018\u504f\u597d\u6811\u2019\uff08ToP\uff09\u7ed3\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u7528\u6237\u4ece\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u7684\u504f\u597d\uff1b\u5229\u7528LLM\u63a8\u7406\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u673a\uff1b\u751f\u6210\u5339\u914d\u672a\u63a2\u7d22\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5408\u6210\u4ea4\u4e92\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u7528\u6237\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u6307\u6807\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u4e14\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5408\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u504f\u5dee\u89c6\u89d2\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u6316\u6398\u9690\u6027\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6837\u5316\u63a8\u8350\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

As a result, tracking aggressive trajectories accurately could be challenging due to the existence of residual physics during controller synthesis. This paper presents a self-supervised residual learning and trajectory optimization framework to address the aforementioned challenges. At first, unknown dynamic effects on the closed-loop model are learned and treated as residuals of the nominal dynamics, jointly forming a hybrid model. We show that learning with analytic gradients can be achieved using only trajectory-level data while enjoying accurate long-horizon prediction with an arbitrary integration step size. Subsequently, a trajectory optimizer is developed to compute the optimal reference trajectory with the residual physics along it minimized. It ends up with trajectories that are friendly to the following control level. The agile flight of quadrotors illustrates that by utilizing the hybrid dynamics, the proposed optimizer outputs aggressive motions that can be precisely tracked.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6b8b\u5dee\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u95ed\u73af\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u672a\u77e5\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6548\u5e94\u4f5c\u4e3a\u540d\u4e49\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6df7\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6b8b\u5dee\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u751f\u6210\u6613\u4e8e\u5e95\u5c42\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7cbe\u786e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u6fc0\u8fdb\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u96be\u4ee5\u88ab\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\u6790\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7efc\u5408\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6b8b\u4f59\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6fc0\u8fdb\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6b8b\u5dee\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u5229\u7528\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u3001\u501f\u52a9\u89e3\u6790\u68af\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u540d\u4e49\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u6b8b\u5dee\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u8fdb\u800c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6cbf\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u7269\u7406\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u654f\u6377\u98de\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df7\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u88ab\u7cbe\u786e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u6fc0\u8fdb\u8fd0\u52a8\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u6fc0\u8fdb\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u5efa\u6a21\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u53cb\u597d\u6027\u3002"}}

Minor revision resubmitted; decision pending", "summary": "Routine clinical imaging of the retina using optical coherence tomography (OCT) is performed with large slice spacing, resulting in highly anisotropic images and a sparsely scanned retina. Most learning-based methods circumvent the problems arising from the anisotropy by using 2D approaches rather than performing volumetric analyses. These approaches inherently bear the risk of generating inconsistent results for neighboring B-scans. For example, 2D retinal layer segmentations can have irregular surfaces in 3D. Furthermore, the typically used convolutional neural networks are bound to the resolution of the training data, which prevents their usage for images acquired with a different imaging protocol. Implicit neural representations (INRs) have recently emerged as a tool to store voxelized data as a continuous representation. Using coordinates as input, INRs are resolution-agnostic, which allows them to be applied to anisotropic data. In this paper, we propose two frameworks that make use of this characteristic of INRs for dense 3D analyses of retinal OCT volumes. 1) We perform inter-B-scan interpolation by incorporating additional information from en-face modalities, that help retain relevant structures between B-scans. 2) We create a resolution-agnostic retinal atlas that enables general analysis without strict requirements for the data. Both methods leverage generalizable INRs, improving retinal shape representation through population-based training and allowing predictions for unseen cases. Our resolution-independent frameworks facilitate the analysis of OCT images with large B-scan distances, opening up possibilities for the volumetric evaluation of retinal structures and pathologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9690\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\uff08INR\uff09\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u9ad8\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u626b\u63cf\u7684\u89c6\u7f51\u819cOCT\u4f53\u79ef\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5bc6\u96c6\u4e09\u7ef4\u5206\u6790\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u7ed3\u5408en-face\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u5b9e\u73b0B-scan\u95f4\u63d2\u503c\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u6784\u5efa\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6cdb\u5316\u5206\u6790\u3002\u4e8c\u8005\u5747\u5229\u7528INR\u7684\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65e0\u5173\u6027\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e09\u7ef4\u7ed3\u6784\u8868\u5f81\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u6210\u50cf\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e38\u89c4OCT\u4e34\u5e8a\u6210\u50cf\u5207\u7247\u95f4\u8ddd\u5927\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u56fe\u50cf\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u4e0e\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u91c7\u6837\u7a00\u758f\uff1b\u73b0\u67092D\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u6613\u9020\u6210\u76f8\u90bbB-scan\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff08\u5982\u5c42\u5206\u5272\u8868\u9762\u4e0d\u5149\u6ed1\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u81f3\u4e0d\u540c\u6210\u50cf\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9690\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\uff08INR\uff09\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u878d\u5408en-face\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u7684B-scan\u95f4\u63d2\u503c\uff1b2\uff09\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u56fe\u8c31\u6784\u5efa\uff1b\u4e8c\u8005\u5747\u91c7\u7528\u5750\u6807\u8f93\u5165\u7684INR\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7fa4\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u73b0\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f3D\u63d2\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u51fa\u53ef\u8de8\u8bbe\u5907\u3001\u8de8\u534f\u8bae\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u56fe\u8c31\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u5927\u95f4\u8dddOCT\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e09\u7ef4\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u8868\u5f81\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "INR\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3OCT\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u4e0e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4f9d\u8d56\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff1b\u6240\u63d0\u4e24\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u7a00\u758fOCT\u6570\u636e\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u901a\u7528\u4e09\u7ef4\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4e34\u5e8a\u8f6c\u5316\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

This paper introduces LendNova, the first practical automated end-to-end pipeline for credit risk assessment, designed to utilize all available information in raw credit records by leveraging advanced NLP techniques and language models. LendNova transforms risk modeling by operating directly on raw, jargon-heavy credit bureau text using a language model that learns task-relevant representations without manual feature engineering. By automatically capturing patterns and risk signals embedded in the text, it replaces manual preprocessing steps, reducing costs and improving scalability.

Creators, in turn, adapt their content to align with users preferences and enhance their popularity. At the same time, users preferences evolve under the influence of both suggested content from the recommender system and content shared within their social circles. This feedback loop generates a complex interplay between users, creators, and recommender algorithms, which is the key cause of filter bubbles and opinion polarization. We develop a social network-aware recommender system that explicitly accounts for this user-creators feedback interaction and strategically exploits the topology of the user's own social network to promote diversification. Our approach highlights how accounting for and exploiting user's social network in the recommender system design is crucial to mediate filter bubble effects while balancing content diversity with personalization. Provably, opinion clusterization is positively correlated with the influence of recommended content on user opinions. Ultimately, the proposed approach shows the power of socially-aware recommender systems in combating opinion polarization and clusterization phenomena.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u7528\u6237-\u521b\u4f5c\u8005-\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u7528\u6237\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5185\u5bb9\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7f13\u89e3\u4fe1\u606f\u8327\u623f\u548c\u89c2\u70b9\u6781\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u6f14\u5316\u3001\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\u5185\u5bb9\u8c03\u6574\u4e0e\u7b97\u6cd5\u63a8\u8350\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u606f\u8327\u623f\u548c\u89c2\u70b9\u6781\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u7528\u6237-\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\u53cd\u9988\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5e76\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u5229\u7528\u7528\u6237\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5185\u5bb9\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u63a8\u8350\u5185\u5bb9\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u89c2\u70b9\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u6b63\u5411\u5173\u8054\u4e8e\u89c2\u70b9\u805a\u7c7b\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u89c2\u70b9\u6781\u5316\u4e0e\u805a\u7c7b\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7eb3\u5165\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u7528\u6237\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5bf9\u7f13\u89e3\u4fe1\u606f\u8327\u623f\u3001\u5e73\u8861\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

As a result, improvements in human-like behavior are largely driven by scale or broad supervised training, rather than targeted alignment. We introduce Human Aligning LLMs (HAL), a framework for aligning language models to conversational human-likeness using an interpretable, data-driven reward. HAL derives explicit conversational traits from contrastive dialogue data, combines them into a compact scalar score, and uses this score as a transparent reward signal for alignment with standard preference optimization methods. Using this approach, we align models of varying sizes without affecting their overall performance. In large-scale human evaluations, models aligned with HAL are more frequently perceived as human-like in conversation. Because HAL operates over explicit, interpretable traits, it enables inspection of alignment behavior and diagnosis of unintended effects. More broadly, HAL demonstrates how soft, qualitative properties of language--previously outside the scope for alignment--can be made measurable and aligned in an interpretable and explainable way.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faHAL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u5230\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5176\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5728\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5b9a\u4e49\u3001\u5ea6\u91cf\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u4e00\u76f4\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5f53\u524d\u6539\u8fdb\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u89c4\u6a21\u6216\u5bbd\u6cdb\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "method": "HAL\u6846\u67b6\u4ece\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u663e\u5f0f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u878d\u5408\u4e3a\u7d27\u51d1\u6807\u91cf\u5f97\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u6b64\u4f5c\u4e3a\u900f\u660e\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6807\u51c6\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "HAL\u6210\u529f\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u88ab\u611f\u77e5\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b-like\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u635f\u5bb3\u5176\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u5bf9\u9f50\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u4e0e\u526f\u4f5c\u7528\u8bca\u65ad\u3002", "conclusion": "HAL\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u8f6f\u6027\u3001\u5b9a\u6027\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u5982\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff09\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Existing meta-learning-based approaches require a shared representation of environmental structures, which lack flexibility for realistic non-structural disturbances. Besides, representation error and the distribution shifts can lead to heavy degradation in prediction accuracy. This work presents a generalizable disturbance estimation framework that builds on meta-learning and feedback-calibrated online adaptation. By extracting features from a finite time window of past observations, a unified representation that effectively captures general non-structural disturbances can be learned without predefined structural assumptions. The online adaptation process is subsequently calibrated by a state-feedback mechanism to attenuate the learning residual originating from the representation and generalizability limitations. Theoretical analysis shows that simultaneous convergence of both the online learning error and the disturbance estimation error can be achieved. Through the unified meta-representation, our framework effectively estimates multiple rapidly changing disturbances, as demonstrated by quadrotor flight experiments.

We address this gap by introducing an encoder-only 3D model that produces language-aligned patch-level features directly from point clouds. Our pre-training approach builds on existing data engines that generate part-annotated 3D shapes by pairing multi-view SAM regions with VLM captioning. Using this data, we train a point cloud transformer encoder in two stages: (1) distillation of dense 2D features from visual encoders such as DINOv2 into 3D patches, and (2) alignment of these patch embeddings with part-level text embeddings through a multi-positive contrastive objective. Our 3D encoder achieves zero-shot 3D part segmentation with fast single-pass inference without any test-time multi-view rendering, while significantly outperforming previous rendering-based and feed-forward approaches across several 3D part segmentation benchmarks.

The conventional rule-based security systems are not always scalable and dynamic to meet such a threat. This paper introduces a threat detection framework based on machine learning that can be used to classify malicious behavior in the social media network environment based on the nature of network traffic. Exploiting a rich network traffic dataset, the massive preprocessing and exploratory data analysis is conducted to overcome the problem of data imbalance, feature inconsistency, and noise. A model of artificial neural network (ANN) is then created to acquire intricate, non-linear tendencies of malicious actions. The proposed model is tested on conventional performance metrics, such as accuracy, accuracy, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC, and shows good detection and high levels of strength. The findings suggest that neural network-based solutions have the potential to be used effectively to identify the latent threat dynamics within the context of a large-scale social media network and that they can be employed to complement the existing intrusion detection system and better to conduct proactive cybersecurity operations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08ANN\uff09\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5a01\u80c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u7f51\u7edc\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6839\u636e\u7f51\u7edc\u6d41\u91cf\u7279\u5f81\u8bc6\u522b\u6076\u610f\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u9884\u5904\u7406\u4e0e\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u5206\u6790\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u3001F1\u5206\u6570\u548cROC-AUC\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u590d\u6742\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\uff08\u5982\u5165\u4fb5\u3001\u5f02\u5e38\u6d41\u91cf\u3001\u6709\u7ec4\u7ec7\u653b\u51fb\uff09\uff1b\u4e9f\u9700\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08ANN\uff09\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7f51\u7edc\u6d41\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5ea6\u9884\u5904\u7406\u4e0e\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u3001F1-score\u548cROC-AUC\u7b49\u5e38\u89c4\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5a01\u80c1\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u73b0\u6709\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6709\u529b\u8865\u5145\uff0c\u652f\u6491\u4e3b\u52a8\u5f0f\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u8fd0\u7ef4\u3002"}}

Frequently retrieved items are consolidated and protected from forgetting, while rarely used items gradually decay, inspired by cognitive consolidation and forgetting principles. On a lightweight retrieval benchmark, ARM reaches near state-of-the-art performance (e.g., NDCG@5 $\\approx$ 0.940, Recall@5 $=1.000$) with only $\\sim$22M parameters in the embedding layer, achieving the best efficiency among ultra-efficient models ($<$25M parameters). In addition, we compare static vs. dynamic RAG combinations across Llama 3.1 and GPT-4o. Llama 3.1 with static RAG achieves the highest key-term coverage (67.2\\%) at moderate latency, while GPT-4o with a dynamic selective retrieval policy attains the fastest responses (8.2s on average) with competitive coverage (58.7\\%).

This work presents a novel multi-modal EPW control system designed to prioritize patient needs while allowing seamless switching between control modes. Four complementary interfaces, namely joystick, speech, hand gesture, and electrooculography (EOG), are integrated with a continuous vital sign monitoring framework measuring heart rate variability, oxygen saturation (SpO2), and skin temperature. This combination enables greater patient independence while allowing caregivers to maintain real-time supervision and early intervention capability.\n  Two-point calibration of the biophysical sensors against clinical reference devices resulted in root mean square errors of at most 2 bpm for heart rate, 0.5 degree Celsius for skin temperature, and 1 percent for SpO2. Experimental evaluation involved twenty participants with mobility impairments executing a total of 500 indoor navigation commands. The achieved command recognition accuracies were 99 percent for joystick control, 97 percent plus or minus 2 percent for speech, and 95 percent plus or minus 3 percent for hand gesture, with an average closed-loop latency of 20 plus or minus 0.5 milliseconds. Caregivers receive real-time alerts through an Android application following encrypted cloud transmission of physiological data. By integrating multi-modal mobility control with cloud-enabled health monitoring and reporting latency and energy budgets, the proposed prototype addresses key challenges in assistive robotics, contributes toward compliance with ISO 7176-31 and IEC 80601-2-78 safety standards, and establishes a foundation for future adaptive machine learning enhancements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7535\u52a8\u8f6e\u6905\uff08EPW\uff09\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u64cd\u7eb5\u6746\u3001\u8bed\u97f3\u3001\u624b\u52bf\u548c\u773c\u7535\u56fe\uff08EOG\uff09\u56db\u79cd\u63a7\u5236\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8fde\u7eed\u751f\u547d\u4f53\u5f81\u76d1\u6d4b\uff08\u5fc3\u7387\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u3001\u8840\u6c27\u9971\u548c\u5ea6\u3001\u76ae\u80a4\u6e29\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u60a3\u8005\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u4e0e\u62a4\u7406\u4eba\u5458\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u62a4\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e0e\u5de5\u4e1a\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9ALS\u3001\u4e2d\u98ce\u540e\u504f\u762b\u53ca\u75f4\u5446\u76f8\u5173\u884c\u52a8\u969c\u788d\u60a3\u8005\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7535\u52a8\u8f6e\u6905\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u5f0f\u5355\u4e00\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5065\u5eb7\u72b6\u6001\u534f\u540c\u76d1\u63a7\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u96c6\u6210\u56db\u79cd\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u6001\uff08\u64cd\u7eb5\u6746\u3001\u8bed\u97f3\u3001\u624b\u52bf\u3001EOG\uff09\u4e0e\u5b9e\u65f6\u751f\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u76d1\u6d4b\uff08HRV\u3001SpO2\u3001\u76ae\u80a4\u6e29\u5ea6\uff09\u7684\u95ed\u73afEPW\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u70b9\u6821\u51c6\u63d0\u5347\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b\u901a\u8fc720\u540d\u6b8b\u969c\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5b8c\u6210500\u6b21\u5ba4\u5185\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u751f\u7406\u6570\u636e\u7ecf\u52a0\u5bc6\u4e91\u7aef\u4f20\u8f93\u81f3Android\u76d1\u62a4\u7aef\u3002", "result": "\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6821\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\uff1a\u5fc3\u7387\u22642 bpm\u3001SpO2\u22641%\u3001\u76ae\u80a4\u6e29\u5ea6\u22640.5\u2103\uff1b\u63a7\u5236\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1a\u64cd\u7eb5\u674699%\u3001\u8bed\u97f397\u00b12%\u3001\u624b\u52bf95\u00b13%\uff1b\u5e73\u5747\u95ed\u73af\u5ef6\u8fdf20\u00b10.5 ms\uff1b\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a0\u5bc6\u4e91\u4f20\u8f93\u4e0e\u5b9e\u65f6\u62a4\u7406\u7aef\u544a\u8b66\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u529f\u878d\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0e\u8fdc\u7a0b\u5065\u5eb7\u76d1\u62a4\uff0c\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3ISO 7176-31\u4e0eIEC 80601-2-78\u5b89\u5168\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u667a\u80fd\u8f85\u5177\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

This paper develops a lightweight computer vision framework that reconciles the efficiency of 2D detection with the necessity of 3D context by reformulating volumetric Computer Tomography (CT) data as sequential video streams. This video-viewpoint paradigm is applied to the time-sensitive task of Intracranial Hemorrhage (ICH) detection using the Hemorica dataset. To ensure operational efficiency, we benchmarked multiple generations of the YOLO architecture (v8, v10, v11 and v12) in their Nano configurations, selecting the version with the highest mAP@50 to serve as the slice-level backbone. A ByteTrack algorithm is then introduced to enforce anatomical consistency across the $z$-axis. To address the initialization lag inherent in video trackers, a hybrid inference strategy and a spatiotemporal consistency filter are proposed to distinguish true pathology from transient prediction noise. Experimental results on independent test data demonstrate that the proposed framework serves as a rigorous temporal validator, increasing detection Precision from 0.703 to 0.779 compared to the baseline 2D detector, while maintaining high sensitivity. By approximating 3D contextual reasoning at a fraction of the computational cost, this method provides a scalable solution for real-time patient prioritization in resource-constrained environments, such as mobile stroke units and IoT-enabled remote clinics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u89c6\u9891\u89c6\u89d2\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c063D CT\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u6d41\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408YOLO Nano\u7cfb\u5217\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u4e0eByteTrack\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u6df7\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6ee4\u6ce2\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9885\u5185\u51fa\u8840\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff08Precision\u4ece0.703\u5347\u81f30.779\uff09\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u4e0e3D\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a3D CNN\u56e0\u9ad8\u5185\u5b58\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u96be\u4ee5\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u800c2D\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5fc5\u89813D\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff1b\u4e9f\u9700\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u79fb\u52a8\u5352\u4e2d\u5355\u5143\uff09\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6ICH\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06CT\u4f53\u79ef\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u6cbfz\u8f74\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6d41\uff1b\u9009\u7528YOLO v8\u2013v12 Nano\u4e2dmAP@50\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u7248\u672c\u4f5c\u5207\u7247\u7ea7\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff1b\u5f15\u5165ByteTrack\u4fdd\u969cz\u8f74\u89e3\u5256\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6df7\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6ee4\u6ce2\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u8ddf\u8e2a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u5047\u9633\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u72ec\u7acb\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0aPrecision\u63d0\u5347\u81f30.779\uff08+7.6%\uff09\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff1b\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8fb9\u7f18\u7aef\u5b9e\u65f6\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u89c6\u9891\u89c6\u89d2\u8303\u5f0f\u53ef\u5728\u6781\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e0b\u8fd1\u4f3c3D\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u533b\u7597\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f18\u5148\u5206\u8bca\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We benchmark this behavior on two real-world settings: event-centric question answering over graph-structured knowledge (Event-QA) and persuasive response generation in Reddit ChangeMyView (CMV). Using LangChain and LangGraph, we compare a one-shot baseline against a plan-execute-replan agent equipped with task-specific tools (DBpedia SPARQL/lookup/schema exploration, Wikipedia-focused retrieval, and topical web search). We evaluate on 60 examples each from Event-QA and CMV (3 splits of 20), and report both mean end-to-end latency and per-example token cost estimates. We evaluate GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini under identical workflows and report accuracy and end-to-end latency. On Event-QA, the best tool-augmented configuration improves accuracy (e.g., 47.5\\% $\\rightarrow$ 67.5\\% for GPT-4o) while increasing latency by orders of magnitude ($\\sim$8s $\\rightarrow$ $\\sim$317s per example). On CMV, one-shot prompting is strongest (e.g., GPT-4o-mini achieves 75\\% at $\\sim$6s), and planning+search increases latency substantially without consistent gains. However, complex multi-tool orchestration exposes failure modes where the smaller model degrades.

We present Chronicals, an open-source training framework achieving 3.51x speedup over Unsloth through four synergistic optimizations: (1) fused Triton kernels eliminating 75% of memory traffic via RMSNorm (7x), SwiGLU (5x), and QK-RoPE (2.3x) fusion; (2) Cut Cross-Entropy reducing logit memory from 5GB to 135MB through online softmax computation; (3) LoRA+ with theoretically-derived 16x differential learning rates between adapter matrices; and (4) Best-Fit Decreasing sequence packing recovering 60-75% of compute wasted on padding.\n  On Qwen2.5-0.5B with A100-40GB, Chronicals achieves 41,184 tokens/second for full fine-tuning versus Unsloth's 11,736 tokens/second (3.51x).

To mitigate this issue, memory-based continual learning has been widely adopted for IR. However, existing methods rely on a fixed set of queries with ground-truth relevant documents, which limits generalization to unseen queries and documents, making them impractical for real-world applications. To enable more effective learning with unseen topics of a new corpus without ground-truth labels, we propose CREAM, a self-supervised framework for memory-based continual retrieval. CREAM captures the evolving semantics of streaming queries and documents into dynamically structured soft memory and leverages it to adapt to both seen and unseen topics in an unsupervised setting. We realize this through three key techniques: fine-grained similarity estimation, regularized cluster prototyping, and stratified coreset sampling. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that CREAM exhibits superior adaptability and retrieval accuracy, outperforming the strongest method in a label-free setting by 27.79\\% in Success@5 and 44.5\\% in Recall@10 on average, and achieving performance comparable to or even exceeding that of supervised methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCREAM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u5185\u5b58\u5f0f\u6301\u7eed\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8f6f\u5185\u5b58\u5efa\u6a21\u6d41\u5f0f\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0e\u6587\u6863\u8bed\u4e49\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\u5373\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u4e3b\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u67e5\u8be2\u53ca\u5176\u6807\u6ce8\u76f8\u5173\u6587\u6863\uff0c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u65e0\u6807\u6ce8\u3001\u65b0\u4e3b\u9898\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCREAM\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u3001\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u805a\u7c7b\u539f\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u6838\u5fc3\u96c6\u91c7\u6837\u4e09\u9879\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5c06\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0e\u6587\u6863\u8bed\u4e49\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u52a8\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8f6f\u5185\u5b58\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5df2\u89c1\u4e0e\u672a\u89c1\u4e3b\u9898\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cCREAM\u5728\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd527.79%\uff08Success@5\uff09\u548c44.5%\uff08Recall@10\uff09\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8e\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "CREAM\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u4e2d\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6301\u7eed\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, the wide range and high variability of permeability prevent existing methods from providing reliable predictions. For the first time in subsurface spatial prediction, this study presents a quantum-enhanced long short-term memory with attention (QLSTMA) model that incorporates variational quantum circuits (VQCs) into the recurrent cell. Using quantum entanglement and superposition principles, the QLSTMA significantly improves the ability to predict complex geological parameters such as permeability. Two quantization structures, QLSTMA with Shared Gates (QLSTMA-SG) and with Independent Gates (QLSTMA-IG), are designed to investigate and evaluate the effects of quantum structure configurations and the number of qubits on model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the 8-qubit QLSTMA-IG model significantly outperforms the traditional long short-term memory with attention (LSTMA), reducing Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by 19% and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) by 20%, with particularly strong performance in regions featuring complex well-logging data. These findings validate the potential of quantum-classical hybrid neural networks for reservoir prediction, indicating that increasing the number of qubits yields further accuracy gains despite the reliance on classical simulations. This study establishes a foundational framework for the eventual deployment of such models on real quantum hardware and their extension to broader applications in petroleum engineering and geoscience.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u91cf\u5b50\u589e\u5f3a\u7684LSTM-Attention\u6a21\u578b\uff08QLSTMA\uff09\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5c06\u53d8\u5206\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\uff08VQC\uff09\u878d\u5165\u5faa\u73af\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u50a8\u5c42\u6e17\u900f\u7387\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u5730\u8d28\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e8\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u7684QLSTMA-IG\u6a21\u578b\u8f83\u4f20\u7edfLSTMA\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eMAE\uff0819%\uff09\u548cRMSE\uff0820%\uff09\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u6df7\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u77f3\u6cb9\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u9884\u6d4b\u5177\u6709\u5bbd\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u9ad8\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u7684\u50a8\u5c42\u6e17\u900f\u7387\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u5730\u8d28\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u91cf\u5b50\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u957f\u77ed\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6-\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\uff08QLSTMA\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u53d8\u5206\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\uff08VQC\uff09\u5d4c\u5165RNN\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u4e0e\u53e0\u52a0\u539f\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e24\u79cd\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\uff1a\u5171\u4eab\u95e8\uff08QLSTMA-SG\uff09\u4e0e\u72ec\u7acb\u95e8\uff08QLSTMA-IG\uff09\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u91cf\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u914d\u7f6e\u53ca\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u6570\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "8\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u7684QLSTMA-IG\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6e17\u900f\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfLSTMA\uff0cMAE\u964d\u4f4e19%\uff0cRMSE\u964d\u4f4e20%\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6d4b\u4e95\u6570\u636e\u533a\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff1b\u589e\u52a0\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u6570\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4ea6\u80fd\u4f53\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u6df7\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u50a8\u5c42\u53c2\u6570\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5177\u5907\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff1b\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u6b64\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u5e76\u62d3\u5c55\u81f3\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u77f3\u6cb9\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e0e\u5730\u7403\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Yet existing VideoQA benchmarks struggle to capture this multimodal reasoning and are largely not open-ended, given the difficulty of evaluating free-form answers. In this paper, we introduce a novel open-ended multi-modal VideoQA benchmark, MovieRecapsQA created using movie recap videos--a distinctive type of YouTube content that summarizes a film by presenting its key events through synchronized visual (recap video) and textual (recap summary) modalities. Using the recap summary, we generate $\\approx 8.2$ K question-answer (QA) pairs (aligned with movie-subtitles) and provide the necessary \"facts\" needed to verify an answer in a reference-free manner. To our knowledge, this is the first open-ended VideoQA benchmark that supplies explicit textual context of the input (video and/or text); which we use for evaluation. Our benchmark provides videos of multiple lengths (i.e., recap-segments, movie-segments) and categorizations of questions (by modality and type) to enable fine-grained analysis. We evaluate the performance of seven state-of-the-art MLLMs using our benchmark and observe that: 1) visual-only questions remain the most challenging; 2) models default to textual inputs whenever available; 3) extracting factually accurate information from video content is still difficult for all models; and 4) proprietary and open-source models perform comparably on video-dependent questions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aMovieRecapsQA\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u7b54\uff08VideoQA\uff09\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7535\u5f71\u56de\u987e\u89c6\u9891\uff08\u540c\u6b65\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u6458\u8981\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u7ea68.2K\u4e2a\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4f9d\u636e\uff1b\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u652f\u6301\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5f53\u524dMLLM\u5728\u7eaf\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u89c6\u9891\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63d0\u53d6\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u663e\u8457\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VideoQA\u57fa\u51c6\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u89c6\u9891\uff08\u5982\u7535\u5f71\uff09\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u5927\u591a\u975e\u5f00\u653e\u6027\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u81ea\u7531\u751f\u6210\u7b54\u6848\uff1b\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u5907\u663e\u5f0f\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001\u652f\u6301\u5f00\u653e\u56de\u7b54\u548c\u53c2\u8003\u65e0\u5173\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eYouTube\u4e0a\u7684\u7535\u5f71\u56de\u987e\u89c6\u9891\uff08\u542b\u540c\u6b65 recap \u89c6\u9891\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u6458\u8981\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6587\u672c\u6458\u8981\u751f\u6210\u7ea68.2K\u4e2a\u4e0e\u5b57\u5e55\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u6027QA\u5bf9\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7b54\u6848\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u2018\u4e8b\u5b9e\u2019\u4f9d\u636e\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u957f\u5ea6\u89c6\u9891\u8f93\u5165\uff08recap-segments / movie-segments\uff09\u4e0e\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u7c7b\uff08\u6309\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u7c7b\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u57287\u4e2aSOTA\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "1\uff09\u7eaf\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u6700\u96be\uff1b2\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u503e\u5411\u4f9d\u8d56\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\uff1b3\uff09\u4ece\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u51c6\u786e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4ecd\u56f0\u96be\uff1b4\uff09\u95ed\u6e90\u4e0e\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u4f9d\u8d56\u578b\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "MovieRecapsQA\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u63d0\u4f9b\u663e\u5f0f\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u6027VideoQA\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524dMLLM\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u89c6\u9891\u8bed\u4e49\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5173\u952e\u77ed\u677f\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8bc4\u6d4b\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0e\u5206\u6790\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002"}}

This narrow focus prevents current benchmarks from revealing systematic reasoning failures, factual blind spots, and robustness limitations of modern LLMs. To bridge this gap, we present FactArena, a fully automated arena-style evaluation framework that conducts comprehensive, stage-wise benchmarking of LLMs across the complete fact-checking pipeline. FactArena integrates three key components: (i) an LLM-driven fact-checking process that standardizes claim decomposition, evidence retrieval via tool-augmented interactions, and justification-based verdict prediction; (ii) an arena-styled judgment mechanism guided by consolidated reference guidelines to ensure unbiased and consistent pairwise comparisons across heterogeneous judge agents; and (iii) an arena-driven claim-evolution module that adaptively generates more challenging and semantically controlled claims to probe LLMs' factual robustness beyond fixed seed data. Across 16 state-of-the-art LLMs spanning seven model families, FactArena produces stable and interpretable rankings. Our analyses further reveal significant discrepancies between static claim-verification accuracy and end-to-end fact-checking competence, highlighting the necessity of holistic evaluation.

Noise correlation, which estimates gradients by correlating perturbations of activity with changes in output, provides a biologically plausible solution to credit assignment but scales poorly as accurately estimating the Jacobian requires that the number of perturbations scale with network size. Moreover, isotropic noise conflicts with neurobiological observations that neural activity lies on a low-dimensional manifold. To address these drawbacks, we propose neural manifold noise correlation (NMNC), which performs credit assignment using perturbations restricted to the neural manifold. We show theoretically and empirically that the Jacobian row space aligns with the neural manifold in trained networks, and that manifold dimensionality scales slowly with network size. NMNC substantially improves performance and sample efficiency over vanilla noise correlation in convolutional networks trained on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-scale models, and recurrent networks. NMNC also yields representations more similar to the primate visual system than vanilla noise correlation.

Recent advancements show that incorporating propagation dynamics can significantly enhance detection performance compared to previous content-only approaches. However, this remains challenging at early stages due to the absence of observable propagation signals. To address this limitation, we propose AVOID, an \\underline{a}gent-driven \\underline{v}irtual pr\\underline{o}pagat\\underline{i}on for early fake news \\underline{d}etection. AVOID reformulates early detection as a new paradigm of evidence generation, where propagation signals are actively simulated rather than passively observed. Leveraging LLM-powered agents with differentiated roles and data-driven personas, AVOID realistically constructs early-stage diffusion behaviors without requiring real propagation data. The resulting virtual trajectories provide complementary social evidence that enriches content-based detection, while a denoising-guided fusion strategy aligns simulated propagation with content semantics. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that AVOID consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting the effectiveness and practical value of virtual propagation augmentation for early fake news detection.

However, state-of-the-art Deep RL (DRL) algorithms typically require large training datasets and often struggle to generalize beyond small-scale training scenarios, even within standard benchmarks. We propose a neuro-symbolic DRL approach that integrates background symbolic knowledge to improve sample efficiency and generalization to more challenging, unseen tasks. Partial policies defined for simple domain instances, where high performance is easily attained, are transferred as useful priors to accelerate learning in more complex settings and avoid tuning DRL parameters from scratch. To do so, partial policies are represented as logical rules, and online reasoning is performed to guide the training process through two mechanisms: (i) biasing the action distribution during exploration, and (ii) rescaling Q-values during exploitation. This neuro-symbolic integration enhances interpretability and trustworthiness while accelerating convergence, particularly in sparse-reward environments and tasks with long planning horizons.

We close this gap with a practical sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) framework that utilizes dense tactile feedback combined with joint torque sensing to explicitly regulate physical interactions. To enable effective sim-to-real transfer, we introduce (i) a computationally fast tactile simulation that computes distances between dense virtual tactile units and the object via parallel forward kinematics, providing high-rate, high-resolution touch signals needed by RL; (ii) a current-to-torque calibration that eliminates the need for torque sensors on dexterous hands by mapping motor current to joint torque; and (iii) actuator dynamics modeling to bridge the actuation gaps with randomization of non-ideal effects such as backlash, torque-speed saturation. Using an asymmetric actor-critic PPO pipeline trained entirely in simulation, our policies deploy directly to a five-finger hand. The resulting policies demonstrated two essential skills: (1) command-based, controllable grasp force tracking, and (2) reorientation of objects in the hand, both of which were robustly executed without fine-tuning on the robot. By combining tactile and torque in the observation space with effective sensing/actuation modeling, our system provides a practical solution to achieve reliable dexterous manipulation.

Such image manipulations can be produced using traditional image editing tools (known as \"shallowfakes\") or advanced artificial intelligence techniques (\"deepfakes\"). While numerous studies have focused on image manipulation localization on either shallowfake images or deepfake videos, few approaches address both cases. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using a deep learning network to localize manipulations in both shallow- and deep-fake images, and proposed a solution for such purpose. To precisely differentiate between authentic and manipulated pixels, we leverage the Vision Mamba network to extract feature maps that clearly describe the boundaries between tampered and untouched regions. To further enhance this separation, we propose a novel Guided Graph Neural Network (G-GNN) module that amplifies the distinction between manipulated and authentic pixels.

These resource limitations make jailbreaking expensive, and the queries generated by attacker LLMs often consist of non-interpretable random prefixes. This paper introduces Lexical Anchor Tree Search (), addressing these limitations through an attacker-LLM-free method that operates purely via lexical anchor injection. LATS reformulates jailbreaking as a breadth-first tree search over multi-turn dialogues, where each node incrementally injects missing content words from the attack goal into benign prompts. Evaluations on AdvBench and HarmBench demonstrate that LATS achieves 97-100% ASR on latest GPT, Claude, and Llama models with an average of only ~6.4 queries, compared to 20+ queries required by other methods. These results highlight conversational structure as a potent and under-protected attack surface, while demonstrating superior query efficiency in an era where high ASR is readily achievable.

Building on insights from prioritized replay in deep RL, as well as prior observations that rollouts with intermediate success rates tend to produce stronger learning signals under methods such as GRPO, our approach selects problems according to a simple, model-driven priority score derived from empirical success statistics. In contrast to conventional curriculum strategies that emphasize easier tasks early in training, the resulting schedule naturally focuses training on problems that are neither consistently solved nor consistently failed, while deprioritizing those that contribute little gradient information. The method yields a continuously adapting and automatic prioritization process that requires no predefined difficulty tiers, auxiliary predictors, or external labels. We further introduce lightweight mechanisms for practical deployment, including heap-based prioritized sampling and periodic retesting of solved and unsolved problems to mitigate starvation and forgetting. Overall, the approach offers a principled and scalable alternative to manually designed curricula while aligning data selection directly with the dynamics of GRPO-based post-training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u95ee\u9898\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u4e2d\u7b49\u96be\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u96be\u5ea6\u7b49\u7ea7\u6216\u5916\u90e8\u6807\u7b7e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u901a\u5e38\u5f3a\u8c03\u4ece\u7b80\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u4f46\u4e2d\u95f4\u6210\u529f\u7387\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u5f80\u5f80\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6216\u989d\u5916\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u5148\u56de\u653e\u601d\u60f3\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u7531\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u8bc4\u5206\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u5806\u6392\u5e8f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f18\u5148\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5468\u671f\u6027\u91cd\u6d4b\u5df2\u89e3/\u672a\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u9965\u997f\u4e0e\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u3001\u8fde\u7eed\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728GRPO\u7c7b\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u8bbe\u5b9a\u96be\u5ea6\u5c42\u7ea7\u6216\u8f85\u52a9\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578bRL\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u539f\u7406\u6e05\u6670\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u514d\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5bf9\u9f50GRPO\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002"}}

On many entertainment platforms such as Netflix, users typically interact with a wide range of titles, each represented by an artwork. Since users have diverse preferences, an artwork that appeals to one type of user may not resonate with another with different preferences. Given this user heterogeneity, our work explores the novel problem of personalized artwork recommendations according to diverse user preferences. Similar to the multi-dimensional nature of users' tastes, titles contain different themes and tones that may appeal to different viewers. For example, the same title might feature both heartfelt family drama and intense action scenes. Users who prefer romantic content may like the artwork emphasizing emotional warmth between the characters, while those who prefer action thrillers may find high-intensity action scenes more intriguing. Rather than a one-size-fits-all approach, we conduct post-training of pre-trained LLMs to make personalized artwork recommendations, selecting the most preferred visual representation of a title for each user and thereby improving user satisfaction and engagement. Our experimental results with Llama 3.1 8B models (trained on a dataset of 110K data points and evaluated on 5K held-out user-title pairs) show that the post-trained LLMs achieve 3-5\\% improvements over the Netflix production model, suggesting a promising direction for granular personalized recommendations using LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5c01\u9762\u56fe\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3LLM\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7528\u6237\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5951\u5408\u5176\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5f71\u89c6\u6807\u9898\u5c01\u9762\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u8350\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5a31\u4e50\u5e73\u53f0\uff08\u5982Netflix\uff09\u4e2d\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5f02\u8d28\uff0c\u540c\u4e00\u5f71\u89c6\u6807\u9898\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u827a\u672f\u5c01\u9762\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7528\u6237\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u2018\u4e00\u5200\u5207\u2019\u63a8\u8350\u7b56\u7565\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5c01\u9762\u63a8\u8350\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982Llama 3.1 8B\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5efa\u6a21\u7528\u6237-\u6807\u9898-\u5c01\u9762\u4e09\u5143\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6839\u636e\u7528\u6237\u5386\u53f2\u504f\u597d\u548c\u6807\u9898\u591a\u7ef4\u8bed\u4e49\uff08\u4e3b\u9898\u3001\u60c5\u7eea\u3001\u98ce\u683c\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7528\u6237\u4ece\u591a\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u5c01\u9762\u4e2d\u9009\u51fa\u6700\u4f18\u5339\u914d\u9879\u3002", "result": "\u572811\u4e07\u6837\u672c\u8bad\u7ec3\u30015\u5343\u5bf9\u7528\u6237-\u6807\u9898\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3LLM\u76f8\u8f83Netflix\u7ebf\u4e0a\u751f\u4ea7\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53473\u20135%\u63a8\u8350\u51c6\u786e\u7387/\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u5177\u5907\u5efa\u6a21\u7528\u6237\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u5185\u5bb9\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u504f\u597d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6491\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u827a\u672f\u5c01\u9762\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u6c89\u6d78\u5f0f\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, existing research on MAD suffers from two fundamental limitations: evaluations are conducted under fragmented and inconsistent settings, hindering fair comparison, and are largely restricted to single-modality scenarios that rely on textual inputs only. To address these gaps, we introduce M3MAD-Bench, a unified and extensible benchmark for evaluating MAD methods across Multi-domain tasks, Multi-modal inputs, and Multi-dimensional metrics. M3MAD-Bench establishes standardized protocols over five core task domains: Knowledge, Mathematics, Medicine, Natural Sciences, and Complex Reasoning, and systematically covers both pure text and vision-language datasets, enabling controlled cross-modality comparison. We evaluate MAD methods on nine base models spanning different architectures, scales, and modality capabilities. Beyond accuracy, M3MAD-Bench incorporates efficiency-oriented metrics such as token consumption and inference time, providing a holistic view of performance--cost trade-offs. Extensive experiments yield systematic insights into the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of MAD across text-only and multimodal scenarios. We believe M3MAD-Bench offers a reliable foundation for future research on standardized MAD evaluation.

We present a follow-the-leader endoscopic robot based on a flexible continuum structure designed to minimize contact between the endoscope body and intestinal walls, thereby reducing patient discomfort. To achieve this objective, we propose a vision-based deep reinforcement learning framework guided by monocular depth estimation. A realistic intestinal simulation environment was constructed in \\textit{NVIDIA Omniverse} to train and evaluate autonomous navigation strategies. Furthermore, thousands of synthetic intraluminal images were generated using NVIDIA Replicator to fine-tune the Depth Anything model, enabling dense three-dimensional perception of the intestinal environment with a single monocular camera. Subsequently, we introduce a geometry-aware reward and penalty mechanism to enable accurate lumen tracking.

Generating them from a single photograph in a controllable manner is particularly challenging. Existing image-animation techniques are restricted to simple, low-frequency motions and operate only in narrow domains with repetitive textures like water and smoke. In contrast, large-scale video diffusion models are not tailored for cinemagraph constraints and lack the specialized data required to generate seamless, controlled loops. We present DreamLoop, a controllable video synthesis framework dedicated to generating cinemagraphs from a single photo without requiring any cinemagraph training data. Our key idea is to adapt a general video diffusion model by training it on two objectives: temporal bridging and motion conditioning. This strategy enables flexible cinemagraph generation. During inference, by using the input image as both the first- and last- frame condition, we enforce a seamless loop. By conditioning on static tracks, we maintain a static background.

While many believe that LLMs do not memorize much of their training data, recent work shows that substantial amounts of copyrighted text can be extracted from open-weight models. However, it remains an open question if similar extraction is feasible for production LLMs, given the safety measures these systems implement. We investigate this question using a two-phase procedure: (1) an initial probe to test for extraction feasibility, which sometimes uses a Best-of-N (BoN) jailbreak, followed by (2) iterative continuation prompts to attempt to extract the book. We evaluate our procedure on four production LLMs -- Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Grok 3 -- and we measure extraction success with a score computed from a block-based approximation of longest common substring (nv-recall). With different per-LLM experimental configurations, we were able to extract varying amounts of text. For the Phase 1 probe, it was unnecessary to jailbreak Gemini 2.5 Pro and Grok 3 to extract text (e.g, nv-recall of 76.8% and 70.3%, respectively, for Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone), while it was necessary for Claude 3.7 Sonnet and GPT-4.1. In some cases, jailbroken Claude 3.7 Sonnet outputs entire books near-verbatim (e.g., nv-recall=95.8%). GPT-4.1 requires significantly more BoN attempts (e.g., 20X), and eventually refuses to continue (e.g., nv-recall=4.0%).

GPFs first introduce some prompt atoms and then learns the optimal prompt vector for each graph node using the linear combination of prompt atoms. However, existing GPFs generally conduct prompting over node's all feature dimensions which is obviously redundant and also be sensitive to node feature noise. To overcome this issue, for the first time, this paper proposes learning sparse graph prompts by leveraging the spiking neuron mechanism, termed Spiking Graph Prompt Feature (SpikingGPF). Our approach is motivated by the observation that spiking neuron can perform inexpensive information processing and produce sparse outputs which naturally fits the task of our graph sparse prompting. Specifically, SpikingGPF has two main aspects. First, it learns a sparse prompt vector for each node by exploiting a spiking neuron architecture, enabling prompting on selective node features. This yields a more compact and lightweight prompting design while also improving robustness against node noise. Second, SpikingGPF introduces a novel prompt representation learning model based on sparse representation theory, i.e., it represents each node prompt as a sparse combination of prompt atoms. This encourages a more compact representation and also facilitates efficient computation. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SpikingGPF.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSpikingGPF\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u56fe\u63d0\u793a\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u5728\u8282\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u8868\u793a\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u63d0\u793a\u7279\u5f81\uff08GPF\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8282\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5197\u4f59\u4e14\u5bf9\u7279\u5f81\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\uff1b\u800c\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5177\u6709\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u548c\u5929\u7136\u7a00\u758f\u8f93\u51fa\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a00\u758f\u56fe\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "method": "SpikingGPF\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\uff1a1\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u67b6\u6784\u5b66\u4e60\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u63d0\u793a\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u63d0\u793a\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u8868\u793a\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5c06\u8282\u70b9\u63d0\u793a\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u63d0\u793a\u539f\u5b50\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u7ebf\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSpikingGPF\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6297\u566a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709GPF\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SpikingGPF\u9996\u6b21\u5c06\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u673a\u5236\u5f15\u5165\u56fe\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e3a\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9002\u914d\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

While extended user-engagement histories can improve the prediction of user interests, it is equally important to embed activity sequences from multiple sources to ensure freshness of user and ad-representations, following scaling law principles. In this paper, we present a novel three-dimensional framework for enhancing user-ad representations without increasing model inference or serving complexity. The first dimension examines the impact of incorporating diverse event sources, the second considers the benefits of longer user histories, and the third focuses on enriching data with additional event attributes and multi-modal embeddings. We assess the return on investment (ROI) of our source enrichment framework by comparing organic user engagement sources, such as content viewing, with ad-impression sources. The proposed method can boost the area under curve (AUC) and the slope of scaling curves for ad-impression sources by 1.56 to 2 times compared to organic usage sources even for short online-sequence lengths of 100 to 10K. Additionally, click-through rate (CTR) prediction improves by 0.56% AUC over the baseline production ad-recommendation system when using enriched ad-impression event sources, leading to improved sequence scaling resolutions for longer and offline user-ad representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e09\u7ef4\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u591a\u6e90\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u5185\u5bb9\u89c2\u770b\u4e0e\u5e7f\u544a\u66dd\u5149\uff09\u3001\u5ef6\u957f\u7528\u6237\u5386\u53f2\u5e8f\u5217\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5c5e\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5e7f\u544a\u63a8\u8350\u6548\u679c\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728AUC\u548cCTR\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u5747\u6709\u660e\u663e\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u5546\u4e1a\u5e7f\u544a\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u591a\u6837\u5316\u3001\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u6765\u51c6\u786e\u523b\u753b\u7528\u6237\u5174\u8da3\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4e92\u52a8\u524d\u540e\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u517c\u987e\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u65b0\u9c9c\u5ea6\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6e90\u878d\u5408\u3001\u5386\u53f2\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e30\u5bcc\u5ea6\u4e09\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e09\u7ef4\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u878d\u5408\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6e90\uff08\u5982\u5185\u5bb9\u89c2\u770b vs \u5e7f\u544a\u66dd\u5149\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u5229\u7528\u66f4\u957f\u7684\u7528\u6237\u5386\u53f2\u5e8f\u5217\uff1b3\uff09\u4e3a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6dfb\u52a0\u5c5e\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\u53ca\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\u3002\u901a\u8fc7ROI\u5206\u6790\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u6e90\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8868\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u6709\u673a\u884c\u4e3a\u6e90\uff08\u5982\u5185\u5bb9\u89c2\u770b\uff09\uff0c\u5e7f\u544a\u66dd\u5149\u6e90\u7ecf\u672c\u6846\u67b6\u589e\u5f3a\u540e\uff0cAUC\u63d0\u53471.56\u20132\u500d\uff0c\u7f29\u653e\u66f2\u7ebf\u659c\u7387\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\uff1b\u5728\u77ed\u5e8f\u5217\uff08100\u201310K\uff09\u4e0b\u4ecd\u6709\u6548\uff1bCTR\u9884\u6d4bAUC\u76f8\u5bf9\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u53470.56%\uff0c\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0e\u79bb\u7ebf\u7528\u6237-\u5e7f\u544a\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6e90\u5e7f\u544a\u66dd\u5149\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u589e\u5f3a\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u5e7f\u544a\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u4e09\u7ef4\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u5728\u96f6\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u589e\u957f\u4e0b\u8fbe\u6210\u663e\u8457\u6536\u76ca\u3002"}}

The material remains compliant during normal interaction but rapidly stiffens under impact, absorbing and dissipating fall-induced forces. Physics-based simulations guide protector placement and thickness and enable learning of active fall policies. Applied to a 42 kg life-size humanoid, the protector markedly reduces peak impact and allows repeated falls without hardware damage, including drops from 3 m and tumbles down long staircases.

Although numerous detection methods have been proposed, their accuracy often degrades when applied to images generated by novel or unseen generative models, highlighting the challenge of achieving strong generalization. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel detection paradigm based on channel removal reconstruction. Specifically, we observe that when the green (G) channel is removed from real images and reconstructed, the resulting reconstruction errors differ significantly from those of AI-generated images. Building upon this insight, we propose G-channel Removed Reconstruction Error (GRRE), a simple yet effective method that exploits this discrepancy for robust AI-generated image detection.

Existing approaches face notable challenges. Filter methods are highly scalable but cannot capture complex relationships or eliminate redundancy. Deep learning-based approaches can model nonlinear patterns but often lack stability, interpretability, and efficiency at scale. Single-head attention improves interpretability but is limited in capturing multi-level dependencies and remains sensitive to initialization, reducing reproducibility. Most existing methods rarely combine statistical interpretability with the representational power of deep learning, particularly in ultra-high-dimensional settings. Here, we introduce MAFS (Multi-head Attention-based Feature Selection), a hybrid framework that integrates statistical priors with deep learning capabilities. MAFS begins with filter-based priors for stable initialization and guide learning. It then uses multi-head attention to examine features from multiple perspectives in parallel, capturing complex nonlinear relationships and interactions. Finally, a reordering module consolidates outputs across attention heads, resolving conflicts and minimizing information loss to generate robust and consistent feature rankings. This design combines statistical guidance with deep modeling capacity, yielding interpretable importance scores while maximizing retention of informative signals. Across simulated and real-world datasets, including cancer gene expression and Alzheimer's disease data, MAFS consistently achieves superior coverage and stability compared with existing filter-based and deep learning-based alternatives, offering a scalable, interpretable, and robust solution for feature selection in high-dimensional biomedical data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMAFS\uff08\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7edf\u8ba1\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff1a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5dee\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5f31\uff1b\u5355\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u83b7\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e14\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u654f\u611f\u3002\u4e9f\u9700\u878d\u5408\u7edf\u8ba1\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u8868\u5f81\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "MAFS\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ee4\u6ce2\u6cd5\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5148\u9a8c\u8fdb\u884c\u7a33\u5b9a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff1b2\uff09\u5229\u7528\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5e76\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b3\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u6a21\u5757\u6574\u5408\u5404\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u51b2\u7a81\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9c81\u68d2\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6392\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u53ca\u771f\u5b9e\u764c\u75c7\u57fa\u56e0\u8868\u8fbe\u3001\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u7b49\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cMAFS\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6ee4\u6ce2\u6cd5\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MAFS\u6210\u529f\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u4e2d\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u4e3a\u7cbe\u51c6\u533b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u517c\u5177\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Different from traditional e-commerce, live-streaming e-commerce shifts the focus from products to streamers, which requires ranking mechanism to balance both purchases and user-streamer interactions for long-term ecology. To trade off multiple objectives, a popular solution is to build an ensemble model to integrate multi-objective scores into a unified score. The ensemble model is usually supervised by multiple independent binary classification losses of all objectives. However, this paradigm suffers from two inherent limitations. First, the optimization direction of the binary classification task is misaligned with the ranking task (evaluated by AUC). Second, this paradigm overlooks the alignment between objectives, e.g., comment and buy behaviors are partially dependent which can be revealed in labels correlations. The model can achieve better trade-offs if it learns the aligned parts of ranking abilities among different objectives.\n  To mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel multi-objective ensemble framework HarmonRank to fulfill both alignment to the ranking task and alignment among objectives. For alignment to ranking, we formulate ranking metric AUC as a rank-sum problem and utilize differentiable ranking techniques for ranking-oriented optimization. For inter-objective alignment, we change the original one-step ensemble paradigm to a two-step relation-aware ensemble scheme.\n  Extensive offline experiments results on two industrial datasets and online experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

While recent approaches including ReAct, Reflexion, and Self-Refine improve reasoning through iterative refinement and reflection, they often lack structured exploration of alternative solution paths and persistent learning across problems. We propose ReTreVal (Reasoning Tree with Validation), a hybrid framework that integrates Tree-of-Thoughts exploration, self-refinement, LLM-based critique scoring, and reflexion memory to enable bounded and validated multi-step reasoning. ReTreVal constructs a structured reasoning tree with adaptive depth based on problem complexity, where each node undergoes iterative self-critique and refinement guided by explicit LLM-generated feedback. A dual validation mechanism evaluates reasoning quality, coherence, and correctness at each node while persistently storing insights from successful reasoning paths and failure patterns in a reflexion memory buffer, enabling cross-problem learning. Critique-based pruning retains only the top-k highest-scoring nodes at each level, controlling computational cost while preserving high-quality solution paths. We evaluate ReTreVal against ReAct, Reflexion, and Self-Refine across 500 mathematical problems and creative writing tasks using Qwen 2.5 7B as the underlying LLM, and demonstrate that ReTreVal consistently outperforms existing methods through its combination of structured exploration, critique-driven refinement, and cross-problem memory, making it particularly effective for tasks requiring exploratory reasoning, rigorous verification, and knowledge transfer.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faReTreVal\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u601d\u7ef4\u6811\u63a2\u7d22\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u7cbe\u70bc\u3001LLM\u6279\u5224\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0e\u53cd\u601d\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u754c\u4e14\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u4e0e\u521b\u610f\u5199\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4ecd\u662f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u521b\u610f\u5199\u4f5c\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982ReAct\u3001Reflexion\u548cSelf-Refine\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u66ff\u4ee3\u89e3\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a2\u7d22\u53ca\u8de8\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faReTreVal\uff08Reasoning Tree with Validation\uff09\uff1a\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u6811\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u7ecfLLM\u751f\u6210\u53cd\u9988\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u81ea\u6279\u5224\u4e0e\u7cbe\u70bc\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\u8bc4\u4f30\u8282\u70b9\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u7ef4\u62a4\u53cd\u601d\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6279\u5224\u5206\u6570\u7684\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\u4fdd\u7559top-k\u8282\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u5728500\u9053\u6570\u5b66\u9898\u4e0e\u521b\u610f\u5199\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ee5Qwen 2.5 7B\u4e3a\u57fa\u5ea7\u6a21\u578b\uff0cReTreVal\u5728\u5404\u9879\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u8d85\u8d8aReAct\u3001Reflexion\u548cSelf-Refine\u3002", "conclusion": "ReTreVal\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a2\u7d22\u3001\u6279\u5224\u9a71\u52a8\u7cbe\u70bc\u4e0e\u8de8\u95ee\u9898\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u534f\u540c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u4e25\u683c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Conventional optimization-based controllers can enforce physical constraints, but they struggle to produce feasible solutions quickly when many obstacles are present. Diffusion models can generate diverse trajectories around obstacles, yet prior approaches lacked a general and efficient way to condition them on scene structure. In this paper, we show that combining diffusion-based warm-starting conditioned with a latent object-centric representation of the scene and with a collision-aware model predictive controller (MPC) yields reliable and efficient motion generation under strict time limits. Our approach conditions a diffusion transformer on the system state, task, and surroundings, using an object-centric slot attention mechanism to provide a compact obstacle representation suitable for control. The sampled trajectories are refined by an optimal control problem that enforces rigid-body dynamics and signed-distance collision constraints, producing feasible motions in real time. On benchmark tasks, this hybrid method achieved markedly higher success rates and lower latency than sampling-based planners or either component alone.

We propose CAMO, a category-agnostic framework that transfers motion to diverse target meshes directly from monocular 2D videos without relying on predefined templates or explicit 3D supervision. The core of CAMO is a morphology-parameterized articulated 3D Gaussian splatting model combined with dense semantic correspondences to jointly adapt shape and pose through optimization. This approach effectively alleviates shape-pose ambiguities, enabling visually faithful motion transfer for diverse categories.

Although reasons for this are multi-faceted, the sparseness of context and the limited data basis of up to ten suggestions per search query pose the most significant problem in identifying bias in search query suggestions. The most proven method to reduce sparseness and improve the validity of bias identification of search query suggestions so far is to consider suggestions from subsequent searches over time for the same query. This work presents a new, alternative approach to search query bias identification that includes less high-level suggestions to deepen the data basis of bias analyses.

In this study, we present a systematic analysis of logical reasoning under controlled increases in logical complexity, and reveal a previously unrecognized phenomenon, which we term Logical Phase Transitions: rather than degrading smoothly, logical reasoning performance remains stable within a regime but collapses abruptly beyond a critical logical depth, mirroring physical phase transitions such as water freezing beyond a critical temperature threshold. Building on this insight, we propose Neuro-Symbolic Curriculum Tuning, a principled framework that adaptively aligns natural language with logical symbols to establish a shared representation, and reshapes training dynamics around phase-transition boundaries to progressively strengthen reasoning at increasing logical depths. Experiments on five benchmarks show that our approach effectively mitigates logical reasoning collapse at high complexity, yielding average accuracy gains of +1.26 in naive prompting and +3.95 in CoT, while improving generalization to unseen logical compositions.

Recent research has advanced this topic significantly; however, many existing approaches remain inefficient due to their reliance on heavy foundation models. To address this limitation, we propose LOST-3DSG, a lightweight open-vocabulary 3D scene graph designed to track dynamic objects in real-world environments. Our method adopts a semantic approach to entity tracking based on word2vec and sentence embeddings, enabling an open-vocabulary representation while avoiding the necessity of storing dense CLIP visual features. As a result, LOST-3DSG achieves superior performance compared to approaches that rely on high-dimensional visual embeddings. We evaluate our method through qualitative and quantitative experiments conducted in a real 3D environment using a TIAGo robot.

However, current 3D mesh saliency GT acquisition methods are generally consistent with 2D image methods, ignoring the differences between 3D geometry topology and 2D image array. Current VR eye-tracking pipelines rely on single ray sampling and Euclidean smoothing, triggering texture attention and signal leakage across gaps. This paper proposes a robust framework to address these limitations. We first introduce a view cone sampling (VCS) strategy, which simulates the human foveal receptive field via Gaussian-distributed ray bundles to improve sampling robustness for complex topologies. Furthermore, a hybrid Manifold-Euclidean constrained diffusion (HCD) algorithm is developed, fusing manifold geodesic constraints with Euclidean scales to ensure topologically-consistent saliency propagation. By mitigating \"topological short-circuits\" and aliasing, our framework provides a high-fidelity 3D attention acquisition paradigm that aligns with natural human perception, offering a more accurate and robust baseline for 3D mesh saliency research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u54113D\u7f51\u683c\u663e\u8457\u6027\u771f\u503c\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u9525\u91c7\u6837\uff08VCS\uff09\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u6d41\u5f62-\u6b27\u6c0f\u7ea6\u675f\u6269\u6563\uff08HCD\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u62d3\u6251\u4e0b\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u663e\u8457\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u66f4\u8d34\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u81ea\u7136\u611f\u77e5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u7f51\u683c\u663e\u8457\u6027\u771f\u503c\u83b7\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u6cbf\u75282D\u56fe\u50cf\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c63D\u51e0\u4f55\u62d3\u6251\u4e0e2D\u56fe\u50cf\u9635\u5217\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u5dee\u5f02\uff1bVR\u773c\u52a8\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4e2d\u5355\u5c04\u7ebf\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u6b27\u6c0f\u5e73\u6ed1\u5bfc\u81f4\u7eb9\u7406\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u504f\u5dee\u4e0e\u8de8\u95f4\u9699\u4fe1\u53f7\u6cc4\u6f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u89c6\u9525\u91c7\u6837\uff08VCS\uff09\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u773c\u4e2d\u592e\u51f9\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u5c04\u7ebf\u675f\u589e\u5f3a\u590d\u6742\u62d3\u6251\u91c7\u6837\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6df7\u5408\u6d41\u5f62-\u6b27\u6c0f\u7ea6\u675f\u6269\u6563\uff08HCD\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u6d41\u5f62\u6d4b\u5730\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u6b27\u6c0f\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u4fdd\u969c\u62d3\u6251\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "result": "\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u2018\u62d3\u6251\u77ed\u8def\u2019\u4e0e\u6df7\u53e0\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u76843D\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\u6027\u771f\u503c\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a3D\u7f51\u683c\u663e\u8457\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4eba\u672c\u89c6\u89c9\u5efa\u6a21\u5728\u865a\u62df\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Both tasks play a critical role in online content moderation by enabling the detection and mitigation of harmful or offensive material, thereby contributing to safer digital environments. In this study, we examine the performance of three transformer-based models: BERT-base-multilingual-cased, RoBERTa-base, and XLM-RoBERTa-base with the first eight layers frozen, for multilingual sentiment analysis and hate speech detection. The evaluation is conducted across five languages: English, Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and French. The models are compared using standard performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

A typical example of such attacks is label poisoning, meaning that some agents possess corrupted local labels and share models trained on these poisoned data. To defend against malicious attacks, existing works often focus on designing robust aggregators; meanwhile, the weighted mean aggregator is typically considered a simple, vulnerable baseline. This paper analyzes the robustness of decentralized gradient descent under label poisoning attacks, considering both robust and weighted mean aggregators. Theoretical results reveal that the learning errors of robust aggregators depend on the network topology, whereas the performance of weighted mean aggregator is topology-independent. Remarkably, the weighted mean aggregator, although often considered vulnerable, can outperform robust aggregators under sufficient heterogeneity, particularly when: (i) the global contamination rate (i.e., the fraction of poisoned agents for the entire network) is smaller than the local contamination rate (i.e., the maximal fraction of poisoned neighbors for the regular agents); (ii) the network of regular agents is disconnected; or (iii) the network of regular agents is sparse and the local contamination rate is high. Empirical results support our theoretical findings, highlighting the important role of network topology in the robustness to label poisoning attacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u52a0\u6743\u5e73\u5747\u805a\u5408\u5668\u867d\u5e38\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u8106\u5f31\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8db3\u591f\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff08\u5982\u5168\u5c40\u6c61\u67d3\u7387\u4f4e\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u6c61\u67d3\u7387\u3001\u6b63\u5e38\u8282\u70b9\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0d\u8fde\u901a\u6216\u7a00\u758f\uff09\u53cd\u800c\u4f18\u4e8e\u9c81\u68d2\u805a\u5408\u5668\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u800c\u9c81\u68d2\u805a\u5408\u5668\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u5219\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u5347\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u6076\u610f\u653b\u51fb\uff08\u5982\u6807\u7b7e\u6295\u6bd2\uff09\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u2018\u52a0\u6743\u5e73\u5747\u805a\u5408\u5668\u5fc5\u7136\u8106\u5f31\u2019\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u8ba4\u77e5\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u4f7f\u7528\u9c81\u68d2\u805a\u5408\u5668\u4e0e\u52a0\u6743\u5e73\u5747\u805a\u5408\u5668\u7684\u6536\u655b\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u6027\uff08\u5982\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3001\u6c61\u67d3\u7387\u5206\u5e03\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u52a0\u6743\u5e73\u5747\u805a\u5408\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u800c\u9c81\u68d2\u805a\u5408\u5668\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8bef\u5dee\u53d7\u62d3\u6251\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff08\u5982\u5168\u5c40\u6c61\u67d3\u7387<\u5c40\u90e8\u6c61\u67d3\u7387\u3001\u6b63\u5219\u8282\u70b9\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0d\u8fde\u901a\u6216\u7a00\u758f\uff09\uff0c\u52a0\u6743\u5e73\u5747\u805a\u5408\u5668\u53ef\u4f18\u4e8e\u9c81\u68d2\u805a\u5408\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u6295\u6bd2\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e2d\u8d77\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u52a0\u6743\u5e73\u5747\u805a\u5408\u5668\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5177\u5907\u610f\u5916\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e0d\u5e94\u88ab\u4e00\u6982\u89c6\u4e3a\u8106\u5f31\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002"}}

Recent latent reasoning methods have shown promise by extending test-time computation through multi-step reasoning, yet they exclusively rely on depth-level scaling along a single trajectory, suffering from diminishing returns as reasoning depth increases. To address this limitation, we propose \\textbf{Parallel Latent Reasoning (PLR)}, a novel framework that pioneers width-level computational scaling by exploring multiple diverse reasoning trajectories simultaneously. PLR constructs parallel reasoning streams through learnable trigger tokens in continuous latent space, preserves diversity across streams via global reasoning regularization, and adaptively synthesizes multi-stream outputs through mixture-of-reasoning-streams aggregation. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that PLR substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining real-time inference efficiency.

With the rising computational cost of training large-scale deep models, dataset distillation has emerged as a promising approach for constructing compact synthetic datasets that retain the knowledge of their large original counterparts. However, traditional optimization-based methods often suffer from high computational overhead, memory constraints, and the generation of unrealistic, noise-like images with limited architectural generalization. Recent non-optimization methods alleviate some of these issues by constructing distilled data from real image patches, but the used rigid patch selection strategies can still discard critical information about the main objects. To solve this problem, we first leverage Grounded SAM2 to identify foreground objects and compute per-image foreground occupancy, from which we derive a category-wise patch decision threshold. Guided by these thresholds, we design a dynamic patch selection strategy that, for each image, either selects the most informative patch from multiple candidates or directly resizes the full image when the foreground dominates. This dual-path mechanism preserves more key information about the main objects while reducing redundant background content. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed method consistently improves distillation performance over existing approaches, producing more informative and representative distilled datasets and enhancing robustness across different architectures and image compositions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u524d\u666f\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528Grounded SAM2\u8bc6\u522b\u524d\u666f\u5e76\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\u6216\u5168\u56fe\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3001\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0d\u771f\u5b9e\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5dee\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u975e\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\uff0c\u4f46\u56fa\u5b9a\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u6613\u4e22\u5931\u5173\u952e\u76ee\u6807\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eGrounded SAM2\u63d0\u53d6\u6bcf\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u524d\u666f\u5360\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u636e\u6b64\u8bbe\u5b9a\u7c7b\u522b\u7ea7\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\u9009\u62e9\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u524d\u666f\u5360\u6bd4\u9ad8\u65f6\u76f4\u63a5\u7f29\u653e\u5168\u56fe\uff0c\u5426\u5219\u4ece\u591a\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u5757\u4e2d\u9009\u6700\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u5927\u7684\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u84b8\u998f\u6570\u636e\u66f4\u5177\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u548c\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u7ec4\u6210\u4e0b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u524d\u666f\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u4fdd\u7559\u4e3b\u8981\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

This project investigates the adversarial robustness of transformer models on the AddSent adversarial dataset through systematic experimentation across model scales and targeted mitigation strategies. We perform comprehensive multi-level error analysis using five complementary categorization schemes, identifying negation confusion and entity substitution as the primary failure modes. Through systematic evaluation of adversarial fine-tuning ratios, we identify 80% clean + 20% adversarial data as optimal. Data augmentation experiments reveal a capacity bottleneck in small models. Scaling from ELECTRA-small (14M parameters) to ELECTRA-base (110M parameters) eliminates the robustness-accuracy trade-off, achieving substantial improvements on both clean and adversarial data. We implement three targeted mitigation strategies, with Entity-Aware contrastive learning achieving best performance: 89.89% AddSent Exact Match (EM) and 90.73% SQuAD EM, representing 94.9% closure of the adversarial gap.

While machine learning (ML) approaches such as deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely studied to enhance OPF solution speed and performance, their practical deployment faces two critical scaling questions: What is the minimum training data volume required for reliable results? How should ML models' complexity balance accuracy with real-time computational limits? Existing studies evaluate discrete scenarios without quantifying these scaling relationships, leading to trial-and-error-based ML development in real-world applications. This work presents the first systematic scaling study for ML-based OPF across two dimensions: data scale (0.1K-40K training samples) and compute scale (multiple NN architectures with varying FLOPs). Our results reveal consistent power-law relationships on both DNNs and physics-informed NNs (PINNs) between each resource dimension and three core performance metrics: prediction error (MAE), constraint violations and speed. We find that for ACOPF, the accuracy metric scales with dataset size and training compute. These scaling laws enable predictable and principled ML pipeline design for OPF. We further identify the divergence between prediction accuracy and constraint feasibility and characterize the compute-optimal frontier. This work provides quantitative guidance for ML-OPF design and deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6f6e\u6d41\uff08OPF\uff09\u5728\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u89c4\u6a21\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u3001\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u53cd\u548c\u6c42\u89e3\u901f\u5ea6\u5747\u9075\u5faa\u5e42\u5f8b\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3aML-OPF\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709ML-OPF\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u6743\u8861\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bd5\u9519\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u5c55\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\uff080.1K\u201340K\u6837\u672c\uff09\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u89c4\u6a21\uff08\u591a\u79cdFLOPs\u7684NN\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u542bDNN\u548cPINN\uff09\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7f29\u653e\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u62df\u5408\u5404\u8d44\u6e90\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\uff08MAE\u3001\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u53cd\u3001\u901f\u5ea6\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e42\u5f8b\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5728ACOPF\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u3001\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u53cd\u548c\u6c42\u89e3\u901f\u5ea6\u5747\u968f\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5448\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5e42\u5f8b\u7f29\u653e\uff1b\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u6b67\uff0c\u5e76\u523b\u753b\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f18\u524d\u6cbf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86ML-OPF\u4e2d\u5173\u952e\u7f29\u653e\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7684ML\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e3a\u5de5\u7a0b\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9a\u91cf\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

To resolve this challenge, we propose an efficient approach to fine-tune small language models (SLMs) for accurate relevance labeling, enabling high-throughput, domain-specific labeling comparable or even better in quality to that of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). To overcome the lack of high-quality and accessible datasets in the enterprise domain, our method leverages on synthetic data generation. Specifically, we employ an LLM to synthesize realistic enterprise queries from a seed document, apply BM25 to retrieve hard negatives, and use a teacher LLM to assign relevance scores. The resulting dataset is then distilled into an SLM, producing a compact relevance labeler. We evaluate our approach on a high-quality benchmark consisting of 923 enterprise query-document pairs annotated by trained human annotators, and show that the distilled SLM achieves agreement with human judgments on par with or better than the teacher LLM. Furthermore, our fine-tuned labeler substantially improves throughput, achieving 17 times increase while also being 19 times more cost-effective.

We therefore propose the rationale-grounded in-context learning for time series reasoning, where rationales work as guiding reasoning units rather than post-hoc explanations, and develop the RationaleTS method. Specifically, we firstly induce label-conditioned rationales, composed of reasoning paths from observable evidence to the potential outcomes.

This challenge becomes more pronounced in real-world settings, where viewpoint variability is unavoidable and can significantly disrupt policy performance. Existing methods typically learn invariance from multi-view observations at the scene level, but such approaches rely on visual appearance and fail to incorporate the physical dynamics essential for robust generalization. We propose View-Invariant Latent Action (VILA), which models a latent action capturing transition patterns across trajectories to learn view-invariant representations grounded in physical dynamics. VILA aligns these latent actions across viewpoints using an action-guided objective based on ground-truth action sequences.

However, existing regression-based approaches often overlook inherent geometric priors, resulting in suboptimal training efficiency and limited localization accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel homography-guided pose estimator network for fine-grained visual localization between multi-view images and standard-definition (SD) maps. We construct input pairs that satisfy a homography constraint by projecting ground-view features into the BEV domain and enforcing semantic alignment with map features. Then we leverage homography relationships to guide feature fusion and restrict the pose outputs to a valid feasible region, which significantly improves training efficiency and localization accuracy compared to prior methods relying on attention-based fusion and direct 3-DoF pose regression. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to unify BEV semantic reasoning with homography learning for image-to-map localization. Furthermore, by explicitly modeling homography transformations, the proposed framework naturally supports cross-resolution inputs, enhancing model flexibility. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art visual localization methods.

Building on a knowledge distillation chain-style model, we introduce a code module to guide knowledge-graph exploration and incorporate code as part of the chain-of-thought prompt, forming an external knowledge input that provides more accurate and structured information to the model. Based on this design, we develop an improved knowledge distillation chain-style model and leverage it to analyze and constrain the reasoning process of LLMs, thereby improving inference accuracy. We empirically evaluate the proposed approach using GPT-4 and LLaMA-3.3 on multiple public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating code modules significantly enhances the model's ability to capture contextual information and effectively mitigates prompt-induced hallucinations.

Although Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at capturing spatial-temporal dependencies in sensor data, their black-box nature and the limited work on graph-based explainable models for water networks hinder practical adoption. We propose an explainable GNN framework that integrates mutual information to identify critical network regions and fuzzy logic to provide clear, rule-based explanations for node classification tasks. After benchmarking several GNN architectures, we selected the generalized graph convolution network (GENConv) for its superior performance and developed a fuzzy-enhanced variant that offers intuitive explanations for classified leak locations. Our fuzzy graph neural network (FGENConv) achieved Graph F1 scores of 0.889 for detection and 0.814 for localization, slightly below the crisp GENConv 0.938 and 0.858, respectively. Yet it compensates by providing spatially localized, fuzzy rule-based explanations.

The core limitation lies in the prevalent ``track-then-descend'' paradigm, which treats the platform as a passive target and forces the quadcopter to perform complex, sequential maneuvers. This paper challenges that paradigm by introducing a bi-directional cooperative landing framework that redefines the roles of the vehicle and the platform. The essential innovation is transforming the problem from a single-agent tracking challenge into a coupled system optimization. Our key insight is that the mobile platform is not merely a target, but an active agent in the landing process. It proactively tilts its surface to create an optimal, stable terminal attitude for the approaching quadcopter. This active cooperation fundamentally breaks the sequential model by parallelizing the alignment and descent phases. Concurrently, the quadcopter's planning pipeline focuses on generating a time-optimal and dynamically feasible trajectory that minimizes energy consumption. This bi-directional coordination allows the system to execute the recovery in an agile manner, characterized by aggressive trajectory tracking and rapid state synchronization within transient windows. The framework's effectiveness, validated in dynamic scenarios, significantly improves the efficiency, precision, and robustness of autonomous quadrotor recovery in complex and time-constrained missions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u5411\u534f\u540c\u7740\u9646\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba9\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u53f0\u4e3b\u52a8\u503e\u659c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u7740\u9646\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u5c06\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8ddf\u8e2a\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u8026\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u4e0b\u964d\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u81ea\u4e3b\u7740\u9646\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3001\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u201c\u5148\u8ddf\u8e2a\u540e\u4e0b\u964d\u201d\u8303\u5f0f\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u5c06\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u53f0\u89c6\u4e3a\u88ab\u52a8\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u590d\u6742\u4e32\u884c\u673a\u52a8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u5411\u534f\u540c\u7740\u9646\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u53f0\u4e3b\u52a8\u503e\u659c\u8868\u9762\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u5b9a\u7ec8\u7aef\u59ff\u6001\uff1b\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u89c4\u5212\u65f6\u95f4\u6700\u4f18\u3001\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u80fd\u8017\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b\u4e8c\u8005\u534f\u540c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u4e3b\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u56de\u6536\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3001\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u654f\u6377\u6027\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e0e\u77ac\u6001\u7a97\u53e3\u5185\u5feb\u901f\u72b6\u6001\u540c\u6b65\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u98de\u884c\u5668\u4e0e\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u5c06\u7740\u9646\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u8026\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53ef\u7a81\u7834\u4f20\u7edf\u8303\u5f0f\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7cbe\u51c6\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u53f0\u81ea\u4e3b\u7740\u9646\u3002"}}

In this work, we identify and quantify a fundamental functional perception gap: the inability of current vision encoders to decode functional tracer biodistribution independent of morphological priors. Identifying Positron Emission Tomography (PET) as the quintessential modality to investigate this disconnect, we introduce PET-Bench, the first large-scale functional imaging benchmark comprising 52,308 hierarchical QA pairs from 9,732 multi-site, multi-tracer PET studies. Extensive evaluation of 19 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals a critical safety hazard termed the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) hallucination trap. We observe that standard CoT prompting, widely considered to enhance reasoning, paradoxically decouples linguistic generation from visual evidence in PET, producing clinically fluent but factually ungrounded diagnoses. To resolve this, we propose Atomic Visual Alignment (AVA), a simple fine-tuning strategy that enforces the mastery of low-level functional perception prior to high-level diagnostic reasoning. Our results demonstrate that AVA effectively bridges the perception gap, transforming CoT from a source of hallucination into a robust inference tool and improving diagnostic accuracy by up to 14.83%.

A central question persists: Why is human language hierarchical? In this study, we show that hierarchization optimally solves the challenge of our limited working memory capacity. We established a likelihood function that quantifies how well the average number of units according to the language processing mechanisms aligns with human working memory capacity (WMC) in a direct fashion. The maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of this function, tehta_MLE, turns out to be the mean of units. Through computational simulations of symbol sequences and validation analyses of natural language sentences, we uncover that compared to linear processing, hierarchical processing far surpasses it in constraining the tehta_MLE values under the human WMC limit, along with the increase of sequence/sentence length successfully. It also shows a converging pattern related to children's WMC development. These results suggest that constructing hierarchical structures optimizes the processing efficiency of sequential language input while staying within memory constraints, genuinely explaining the universal hierarchical nature of human language.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u662f\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bed\u8a00\u4e3a\u9002\u5e94\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5bb9\u91cf\u9650\u5236\u800c\u6f14\u5316\u51fa\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f3c\u7136\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5c42\u6b21\u5904\u7406\u6bd4\u7ebf\u6027\u5904\u7406\u66f4\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7ea6\u675f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8d1f\u8377\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u91ca\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bed\u8a00\u4e3a\u4f55\u5177\u6709\u666e\u904d\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u63a2\u7a76\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u662f\u5426\u6e90\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6709\u9650\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5bb9\u91cf\uff08WMC\uff09\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f3c\u7136\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4ee5\u91cf\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u5355\u5143\u6570\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5bb9\u91cf\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u4f30\u8ba1\uff08theta_MLE\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u7b26\u53f7\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u62df\u53ca\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u53e5\u5b50\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u5904\u7406\u76f8\u6bd4\u7ebf\u6027\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5c06theta_MLE\u7ea6\u675f\u5728\u4eba\u7c7bWMC\u9650\u5236\u5185\uff0c\u4e14\u8be5\u4f18\u52bf\u968f\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\uff1b\u8fd8\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u4e0e\u513f\u7ae5WMC\u53d1\u80b2\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u987a\u5e8f\u8bed\u8a00\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u5904\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e25\u683c\u670d\u4ece\u4eba\u7c7b\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u751f\u7406\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u771f\u6b63\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u666e\u904d\u5c42\u6b21\u6027\u3002"}}

The current approaches focus on reinforcement learning (RL) and generative models. These efforts imitate offline historical behaviors by utilizing a complex structure with expensive hyperparameter tuning. The suboptimal trajectories further exacerbate the difficulty of policy learning.\n  To address these challenges, we proposes QGA, a novel Q-value regularized Generative Auto-bidding method. In QGA, we propose to plug a Q-value regularization with double Q-learning strategy into the Decision Transformer backbone. This design enables joint optimization of policy imitation and action-value maximization, allowing the learned bidding policy to both leverage experience from the dataset and alleviate the adverse impact of the suboptimal trajectories. Furthermore, to safely explore the policy space beyond the data distribution, we propose a Q-value guided dual-exploration mechanism, in which the DT model is conditioned on multiple return-to-go targets and locally perturbed actions. This entire exploration process is dynamically guided by the aforementioned Q-value module, which provides principled evaluation for each candidate action.

Project Bluebird, an industry-academic collaboration, has developed a probabilistic Digital Twin of en route UK airspace as an environment for training and testing AI Air Traffic Control (ATC) agents. There is a developing regulatory landscape for this kind of novel technology. Regulatory requirements are expected to be application specific, and may need to be tailored to each specific use case.\n  We draw on emerging guidance for both Digital Twin development and the use of Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) in Air Traffic Management (ATM) to present an assurance framework. This framework defines actionable goals and the evidence required to demonstrate that a Digital Twin accurately represents its physical counterpart and also provides sufficient functionality across target use cases. It provides a structured approach for researchers to assess, understand and document the strengths and limitations of the Digital Twin, whilst also identifying areas where fidelity could be improved. Furthermore, it serves as a foundation for engagement with stakeholders and regulators, supporting discussions around the regulatory needs for future applications, and contributing to the emerging guidance through a concrete, working example of a Digital Twin.\n  The framework leverages a methodology known as Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance (TEA) to develop an assurance case. An assurance case is a nested set of structured arguments that provides justified evidence for how a top-level goal has been realised. In this paper we provide an overview of each structured argument and a number of deep dives which elaborate in more detail upon particular arguments, including the required evidence, assumptions and justifications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u822a\u7a7a\u9886\u57df\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u82f1\u56fd\u7a7a\u57df\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\uff09\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u4fdd\u969c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u878d\u5408TEA\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u4fdd\u969c\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301AI\u7a7a\u7ba1\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53ca\u76d1\u7ba1\u5408\u89c4\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e94\u5bf9\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u4e0eAI/ML\u5728\u7a7a\u7ba1\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u957f\u7684\u76d1\u7ba1\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u901a\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u4fdd\u969c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u9700\u786e\u4fdd\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u51c6\u786e\u8868\u5f81\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e76\u6ee1\u8db3\u7279\u5b9a\u7528\u4f8b\u529f\u80fd\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b0\u5174\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u4e0eAI/ML\u5728\u7a7a\u7ba1\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53ef\u4fe1\u4e0e\u4f26\u7406\u4fdd\u969c\uff08TEA\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4fdd\u969c\u6848\u4f8b\uff08assurance case\uff09\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u5bf9\u5e94\u8bc1\u636e\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c42\u8bba\u8bc1\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5256\u6790\uff08\u542b\u8bc1\u636e\u3001\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0e\u4f9d\u636e\uff09\u652f\u6491\u9876\u5c42\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u4fdd\u969c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u4e0e\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u65b9\u53ca\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u5bf9\u8bdd\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u76d1\u7ba1\u6307\u5357\u5236\u5b9a\u8d21\u732e\u5b9e\u9645\u8303\u4f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8eProject Bluebird\u4e2d\u7684\u6982\u7387\u578b\u7a7a\u57df\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3a\u5176\u4ed6\u822a\u7a7aAI\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u6027\u4e0e\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

At the abstract layer, situation calculus models the world and derives weakest preconditions, enabling constraint-aware combinatorial testing to systematically generate diverse, semantically valid world-task configurations with controllable coverage strength.

In these challenging environments, the platform must rely exclusively on inertial sensors, leading to pure inertial navigation. However, the inherent noise and other error terms of the inertial sensors in such real-world scenarios will cause the navigation solution to drift over time. Although conventional deep-learning models have emerged as a possible approach to inertial navigation, they are inherently black-box in nature. Furthermore, they struggle to learn effectively with limited supervised sensor data and often fail to preserve physical principles. To address these limitations, we propose PiDR, a physics-informed inertial dead-reckoning framework for autonomous platforms in situations of pure inertial navigation. PiDR offers transparency by explicitly integrating inertial navigation principles into the network training process through the physics-informed residual component. PiDR plays a crucial role in mitigating abrupt trajectory deviations even under limited or sparse supervision. We evaluated PiDR on real-world datasets collected by a mobile robot and an autonomous underwater vehicle. We obtained more than 29% positioning improvement in both datasets, demonstrating the ability of PiDR to generalize different platforms operating in various environments and dynamics. Thus, PiDR offers a robust, lightweight, yet effective architecture and can be deployed on resource-constrained platforms, enabling real-time pure inertial navigation in adverse scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u60ef\u6027\u822a\u4f4d\u63a8\u7b97\u6846\u67b6PiDR\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u60ef\u6027\u5bfc\u822a\u539f\u7406\u663e\u5f0f\u878d\u5165\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7eaf\u60ef\u6027\u5bfc\u822a\u5728\u65e0GNSS\u6216\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u6c34\u4e0b\u5e73\u53f0\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d8529%\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u7eaf\u60ef\u6027\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u566a\u58f0\u5bfc\u81f4\u8f68\u8ff9\u6f02\u79fb\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u9ed1\u7bb1\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPiDR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u6b8b\u5dee\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5c06\u60ef\u6027\u5bfc\u822a\u539f\u7406\uff08\u5982\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u65b9\u7a0b\uff09\u5d4c\u5165\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u4f4e\u76d1\u7763\u3001\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0e\u81ea\u4e3b\u6c34\u4e0b\u822a\u884c\u5668\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u8d8529%\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u8de8\u5e73\u53f0\u3001\u8de8\u73af\u5883\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u5e73\u53f0\u5b9e\u65f6\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "conclusion": "PiDR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7eaf\u60ef\u6027\u5bfc\u822a\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u9ed1\u7bb1\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8eGNSS\u62d2\u6b62\u7b49\u6076\u52a3\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Extended version of our ICCV 2025 highlight paper [arXiv:2503.07940]. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2503.07940", "summary": "Some deep learning-based point cloud registration methods struggle with zero-shot generalization, often requiring dataset-specific hyperparameter tuning or retraining for new environments. We identify three critical limitations: (a) fixed user-defined parameters (e.g., voxel size, search radius) that fail to generalize across varying scales, (b) learned keypoint detectors exhibit poor cross-domain transferability, and (c) absolute coordinates amplify scale mismatches between datasets. To address these three issues, we present BUFFER-X, a training-free registration framework that achieves zero-shot generalization through: (a) geometric bootstrapping for automatic hyperparameter estimation, (b) distribution-aware farthest point sampling to replace learned detectors, and (c) patch-level coordinate normalization to ensure scale consistency. Our approach employs hierarchical multi-scale matching to extract correspondences across local, middle, and global receptive fields, enabling robust registration in diverse environments. For efficiency-critical applications, we introduce BUFFER-X-Lite, which reduces total computation time by 43% (relative to BUFFER-X) through early exit strategies and fast pose solvers while preserving accuracy. We evaluate on a comprehensive benchmark comprising 12 datasets spanning object-scale, indoor, and outdoor scenes, including cross-sensor registration between heterogeneous LiDAR configurations. Results demonstrate that our approach generalizes effectively without manual tuning or prior knowledge of test domains.

We introduce WBC (Window-Based Comparison), which exploits this insight through a sliding window approach with sign-based aggregation. Our method slides windows of varying sizes across text sequences, with each window casting a binary vote on membership based on loss comparisons between target and reference models. By ensembling votes across geometrically spaced window sizes, we capture memorization patterns from token-level artifacts to phrase-level structures. Extensive experiments across eleven datasets demonstrate that WBC substantially outperforms established baselines, achieving higher AUC scores and 2-3 times improvements in detection rates at low false positive thresholds.

However, in future 6G scenarios characterized by high-speed network entities and fast-changing environments, it is very challenging to meet real-time requirements. Although generative diffusion models (DMs) can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy with second-level delay, their iterative nature leads to prohibitive inference latency in delay-sensitive scenarios. In this paper, by uncovering a key structural property of diffusion processes: the latent midpoints remain highly consistent across semantically similar scenes, we propose RadioDiff-Flux, a novel two-stage latent diffusion framework that decouples static environmental modeling from dynamic refinement, enabling the reuse of precomputed midpoints to bypass redundant denoising. In particular, the first stage generates a coarse latent representation using only static scene features, which can be cached and shared across similar scenarios. The second stage adapts this representation to dynamic conditions and transmitter locations using a pre-trained model, thereby avoiding repeated early-stage computation. The proposed RadioDiff-Flux significantly reduces inference time while preserving fidelity. Experiment results show that RadioDiff-Flux can achieve up to 50 acceleration with less than 0.15% accuracy loss, demonstrating its practical utility for fast, scalable RM generation in future 6G networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faRadioDiff-Flux\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u9759\u6001\u73af\u5883\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u7ec6\u5316\uff0c\u590d\u7528\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u70b9\u4ee5\u8df3\u8fc7\u5197\u4f59\u53bb\u566a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u57286G\u9ad8\u901f\u3001\u5feb\u53d8\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u8fed\u4ee3\u7279\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u65f6\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u56fe\uff08RM\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6f5c\u5728\u4e2d\u70b9\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4ec5\u7528\u9759\u6001\u573a\u666f\u7279\u5f81\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u7f13\u5b58\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0e\u53d1\u5c04\u673a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7ec6\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eRadioDiff-Flux\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u9ad850\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4e14\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u4f4e\u4e8e0.15%\u3002", "conclusion": "RadioDiff-Flux\u4e3a\u672a\u67656G\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing post-training approaches for VLA models are typically offline, single-robot, or task-specific, limiting effective on-policy adaptation and scalable learning from real-world interaction. We introduce a Scalable Online Post-training (SOP) system that enables online, distributed, multi-task post-training of generalist VLA models directly in the physical world. SOP tightly couples execution and learning through a closed-loop architecture in which a fleet of robots continuously streams on-policy experience and human intervention signals to a centralized cloud learner, and asynchronously receives updated policies. This design supports prompt on-policy correction, scales experience collection through parallel deployment, and preserves generality during adaptation. SOP is agnostic to the choice of post-training algorithm; we instantiate it with both interactive imitation learning (HG-DAgger) and reinforcement learning (RECAP). Across a range of real-world manipulation tasks including cloth folding, box assembly, and grocery restocking, we show that SOP substantially improves the performance of large pretrained VLA models while maintaining a single shared policy across tasks. Effective post-training can be achieved within hours of real-world interaction, and performance scales near-linearly with the number of robots in the fleet. These results suggest that tightly coupling online learning with fleet-scale deployment is instrumental to enabling efficient, reliable, and scalable post-training of generalist robot policies in the physical world.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08SOP\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08VLA\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5728\u7ebf\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u3001\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u5355\u7b56\u7565\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VLA\u6a21\u578b\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u79bb\u7ebf\u3001\u5355\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6216\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSOP\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u95ed\u73af\u67b6\u6784\u5c06\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u96c6\u7fa4\u5b9e\u65f6\u91c7\u96c6\u7684on-policy\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0a\u4f20\u81f3\u4e91\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\uff0c\u5f02\u6b65\u4e0b\u53d1\u66f4\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u517c\u5bb9\u591a\u79cd\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u5982HG-DAgger\u548cRECAP\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e03\u6599\u6298\u53e0\u3001\u76d2\u5b50\u7ec4\u88c5\u3001\u6742\u8d27\u8865\u8d27\u7b49\u771f\u5b9e\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cSOP\u6570\u5c0f\u65f6\u5185\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3VLA\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6570\u91cf\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u7ef4\u6301\u5355\u4e00\u5171\u4eab\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7d27\u8026\u5408\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u901a\u7528\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Recent work has made significant progress, but its reliance on large-scale datasets and complex decoders has limited its efficiency and generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and data-centric framework for zero-shot monocular depth estimation. We first adopt DINOv3 as the visual encoder to obtain high-quality dense features. Secondly, to address the inherent drawbacks of the complex structure of the DPT, we design the Simple Depth Transformer (SDT), a compact transformer-based decoder. Compared to the DPT, it uses a single-path feature fusion and upsampling process to reduce the computational overhead of cross-scale feature fusion, achieving higher accuracy while reducing the number of parameters by approximately 85%-89%. Furthermore, we propose a quality-based filtering strategy to filter out harmful samples, thereby reducing dataset size while improving overall training quality. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that our framework surpasses the DPT in accuracy. This work highlights the importance of balancing model design and data quality for achieving efficient and generalizable zero-shot depth estimation. Code: https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/AnyDepth.

To address this gap, we propose EComStage, a unified benchmark for evaluating agent-capable LLMs across the comprehensive stage-wise reasoning process: Perception (understanding user intent), Planning (formulating an action plan), and Action (executing the decision). EComStage evaluates LLMs through seven separate representative tasks spanning diverse e-commerce scenarios, with all samples human-annotated and quality-checked. Unlike prior benchmarks that focus only on customer-oriented interactions, EComStage also evaluates merchant-oriented scenarios, including promotion management, content review, and operational support relevant to real-world applications. We evaluate a wide range of over 30 LLMs, spanning from 1B to over 200B parameters, including open-source models and closed-source APIs, revealing stage/orientation-specific strengths and weaknesses.

Feedback welcome", "summary": "CTMC/DTMC-based discrete generative models, including uniform-noise discrete diffusion (e.g., D3PM/CTDD) and discrete flow matching, enable non-autoregressive sequence generation by repeatedly replacing tokens through a time-inhomogeneous Markov process. Inference is typically implemented with step-based simulation: each token decides to jump via independent Bernoulli (or categorical) draws at every discretization step. Under uniform-noise initialization, where self-correction requires multiple edits per position, these independent decisions induce substantial variance in both the number and timing of edits, leading to characteristic failure modes such as under-editing (residual noise) or over-editing (cascading unnecessary substitutions), decreasing reproducibility.\n  We propose Stratified Hazard Sampling (SHS), a drop-in and hyperparameter-free inference principle for any sampler that admits a stay-vs.-replace decomposition. SHS models per-token edits as events driven by cumulative hazard (CTMC) or cumulative jump mass (DTMC) and places events by stratifying this cumulative quantity: with a single random phase per position, a token jumps whenever its accumulated hazard crosses unit-spaced thresholds. This preserves the expected number of jumps while achieving the minimum possible variance among unbiased integer estimators (bounded by 1/4), without altering per-jump destination sampling and thus retaining multimodality. We also introduce a phase-allocation variant for blacklist-style lexical constraints that prioritizes early edits at high-risk positions to mitigate late-masking artifacts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u98ce\u9669\u91c7\u6837\uff08SHS\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u57fa\u4e8eCTMC/DTMC\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u7d2f\u79ef\u98ce\u9669\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\u3001\u9ad8\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684token\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eCTMC/DTMC\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982D3PM\u3001CTDD\uff09\u5728\u5747\u5300\u566a\u58f0\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4e0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u72ec\u7acb\u4f2f\u52aa\u5229\u51b3\u7b56\u8fdb\u884c\u9010\u6b65\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7f16\u8f91\u6b21\u6570\u4e0e\u65f6\u673a\u65b9\u5dee\u5927\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u6b20\u7f16\u8f91\u6216\u8fc7\u7f16\u8f91\u7b49\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u635f\u5bb3\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u98ce\u9669\u91c7\u6837\uff08SHS\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2atoken\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u7531\u7d2f\u79ef\u98ce\u9669\uff08CTMC\uff09\u6216\u7d2f\u79ef\u8df3\u8dc3\u8d28\u91cf\uff08DTMC\uff09\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5206\u914d\u5355\u4e00\u968f\u673a\u76f8\u4f4d\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7d2f\u79ef\u91cf\u8de8\u8d8a\u5355\u4f4d\u95f4\u9694\u9608\u503c\u65f6\u89e6\u53d1\u8df3\u8dc3\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7f16\u8f91\u6b21\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u76f8\u4f4d\u5206\u914d\u53d8\u4f53\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u9ed1\u540d\u5355\u5f0f\u8bcd\u6c47\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4f4d\u7f6e\u65e9\u671f\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "result": "SHS\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u3001\u514d\u8c03\u53c2\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u6709\u8df3\u8f6c\u76ee\u6807\u91c7\u6837\u4e0d\u53d8\uff08\u56e0\u800c\u4fdd\u7559\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6027\uff09\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7f16\u8f91\u6b21\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u5dee\u964d\u81f3\u7406\u8bba\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\uff08\u22641/4\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3\u6b20/\u8fc7\u7f16\u8f91\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\uff1b\u76f8\u4f4d\u5206\u914d\u53d8\u4f53\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u665a\u671f\u63a9\u853d\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "SHS\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4/\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7406\u8bba\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\uff0c\u662f\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u4e0e\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u63a8\u7406\u5347\u7ea7\u3002"}}

However, the nonlinear programs approximating the OCPs are inherently nonconvex due to the coupling between the dynamics and the event timing, and therefore, they are challenging to solve. Most approaches address this challenge by predefining waypoint times or just using nonconvex trajectory optimization, which simplifies the problem but often yields suboptimal solutions. To significantly improve the numerical properties, we propose a formulation with a time-scaling direct multiple shooting scheme that partitions the prediction horizon into segments aligned with characteristic time constraints. Moreover, we develop a fast semidefinite-programming-based convex relaxation that exploits the sparsity pattern of the lifted formulation. Comprehensive simulation studies demonstrate the solution optimality and computational efficiency.

Project page: https://github.com/House-yuyu/ClearAIR", "summary": "All-in-One Image Restoration (AiOIR) has advanced significantly, offering promising solutions for complex real-world degradations. However, most existing approaches rely heavily on degradation-specific representations, often resulting in oversmoothing and artifacts. To address this, we propose ClearAIR, a novel AiOIR framework inspired by Human Visual Perception (HVP) and designed with a hierarchical, coarse-to-fine restoration strategy. First, leveraging the global priority of early HVP, we employ a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based Image Quality Assessment (IQA) model for overall evaluation. Unlike conventional IQA, our method integrates cross-modal understanding to more accurately characterize complex, composite degradations. Building upon this overall assessment, we then introduce a region awareness and task recognition pipeline. A semantic cross-attention, leveraging semantic guidance unit, first produces coarse semantic prompts. Guided by this regional context, a degradation-aware module implicitly captures region-specific degradation characteristics, enabling more precise local restoration.

MiMo-V2-Flash adopts a hybrid attention architecture that interleaves Sliding Window Attention (SWA) with global attention, with a 128-token sliding window under a 5:1 hybrid ratio. The model is pre-trained on 27 trillion tokens with Multi-Token Prediction (MTP), employing a native 32k context length and subsequently extended to 256k. To efficiently scale post-training compute, MiMo-V2-Flash introduces a novel Multi-Teacher On-Policy Distillation (MOPD) paradigm. In this framework, domain-specialized teachers (e.g., trained via large-scale reinforcement learning) provide dense and token-level reward, enabling the student model to perfectly master teacher expertise. MiMo-V2-Flash rivals top-tier open-weight models such as DeepSeek-V3.2 and Kimi-K2, despite using only 1/2 and 1/3 of their total parameters, respectively. During inference, by repurposing MTP as a draft model for speculative decoding, MiMo-V2-Flash achieves up to 3.6 acceptance length and 2.6x decoding speedup with three MTP layers.

However, developing an accurate prediction model is highly challenging in an uncertain and volatile market environment. For instance, although linear models generally exhibit competitive performance in predicting electricity prices with minimal computational requirements, they fail to capture relevant nonlinear relationships. Nonlinear models, on the other hand, can improve forecasting accuracy with a surge in computational costs. We propose a novel multivariate neural network approach that combines linear and nonlinear feed-forward neural structures. Unlike previous hybrid models, our approach integrates online learning and forecast combination for efficient training and accuracy improvement. It also incorporates all relevant characteristics, particularly the fundamental relationships arising from wind and solar generation, electricity demand patterns, related energy fuel and carbon markets, in addition to autoregressive dynamics and calendar effects. Compared to the current state-of-the-art benchmark models, the proposed forecasting method significantly reduces computational cost while delivering superior forecasting accuracy (12-13% RMSE and 15-18% MAE reductions).

In the context of customer-facing chatbots, companies are dealing with large amounts of user utterances that need to be clustered according to their intent. In these commercial settings, no labeled data is typically available, and the number of clusters is not known. Our method is based on iterative vector updating: it constructs sparse vectors based on representative texts, and then iteratively refines them through LLM guidance. Our method achieves comparable or superior results to state-of-the-art methods that use contrastive learning, but without assuming prior knowledge of clusters or labels.

Existing explainability approaches in robotics typically either focus on individual modules, which can be difficult to query from the perspective of high-level behaviour, or employ monolithic approaches, which do not exploit the modularity of robotic architectures. We present HEXAR (Hierarchical EXplainability Architecture for Robots), a novel framework that provides a plug-in, hierarchical approach to generate explanations about robotic systems. HEXAR consists of specialised component explainers using diverse explanation techniques (e.g., LLM-based reasoning, causal models, feature importance, etc) tailored to specific robot modules, orchestrated by an explainer selector that chooses the most appropriate one for a given query. We implement and evaluate HEXAR on a TIAGo robot performing assistive tasks in a home environment, comparing it against end-to-end and aggregated baseline approaches across 180 scenario-query variations. We observe that HEXAR significantly outperforms baselines in root cause identification, incorrect information exclusion, and runtime, offering a promising direction for transparent autonomous systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faHEXAR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5c42\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u5668\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u63d2\u62d4\u3001\u5206\u5c42\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728TIAGo\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u6839\u56e0\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u6392\u9664\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u5c42\u884c\u4e3a\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u91c7\u7528\u6574\u4f53\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u65e0\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHEXAR\uff08Hierarchical EXplainability Architecture for Robots\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u9762\u5411\u4e0d\u540c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u4e13\u7528\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\uff08\u5982LLM\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u7b49\uff09\u53ca\u4e00\u4e2a\u6839\u636e\u67e5\u8be2\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728TIAGo\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6267\u884c\u5bb6\u5ead\u8f85\u52a9\u4efb\u52a1\u7684180\u79cd\u573a\u666f-\u67e5\u8be2\u7ec4\u5408\u4e2d\uff0cHEXAR\u5728\u6839\u56e0\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u6392\u9664\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u548c\u805a\u5408\u5f0f\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "HEXAR\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u900f\u660e\u3001\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Code:https://github.com/ChangPtR/AbdMLLM", "summary": "Visual abductive reasoning (VAR) is a challenging task that requires AI systems to infer the most likely explanation for incomplete visual observations. While recent MLLMs develop strong general-purpose multimodal reasoning capabilities, they fall short in abductive inference, as compared to human beings. To bridge this gap, we draw inspiration from the interplay between verbal and pictorial abduction in human cognition, and propose to strengthen abduction of MLLMs by mimicking such dual-mode behavior. Concretely, we introduce AbductiveMLLM comprising of two synergistic components: REASONER and IMAGINER. The REASONER operates in the verbal domain. It first explores a broad space of possible explanations using a blind LLM and then prunes visually incongruent hypotheses based on cross-modal causal alignment. The remaining hypotheses are introduced into the MLLM as targeted priors, steering its reasoning toward causally coherent explanations. The IMAGINER, on the other hand, further guides MLLMs by emulating human-like pictorial thinking. It conditions a text-to-image diffusion model on both the input video and the REASONER's output embeddings to \"imagine\" plausible visual scenes that correspond to verbal explanation, thereby enriching MLLMs' contextual grounding. The two components are trained jointly in an end-to-end manner.

Consequently, sparse attention has received increasing attention as a scalable alternative. However, existing sparse attention methods rely on coarse-grained semantic representations during block selection, which blur intra-block semantic boundaries and lead to the loss of critical information. To address this issue, we propose \\textbf{P}unctuation-aware \\textbf{H}ybrid \\textbf{S}parse \\textbf{A}ttention \\textbf{(PHSA)}, a natively trainable sparse attention framework that leverages punctuation tokens as semantic boundary anchors. Specifically, (1) we design a dual-branch aggregation mechanism that fuses global semantic representations with punctuation-enhanced boundary features, preserving the core semantic structure while introducing almost no additional computational overhead; (2) we introduce an extreme-sparsity-adaptive training and inference strategy that stabilizes model behavior under very low token activation ratios; Extensive experiments on general benchmarks and long-context evaluations demonstrate that PHSA consistently outperforms dense attention and state-of-the-art sparse attention baselines, including InfLLM v2. Specifically, for the 0.6B-parameter model with 32k-token input sequences, PHSA can reduce the information loss by 10.8\\% at a sparsity ratio of 97.3\\%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6807\u70b9\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff08PHSA\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6807\u70b9\u7b26\u53f7\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u8fb9\u754c\u951a\u70b9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u805a\u5408\u548c\u6781\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5757\u9009\u62e9\u4e2d\u4f9d\u8d56\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6a21\u7cca\u4e86\u5757\u5185\u8bed\u4e49\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPHSA\u6846\u67b6\uff1a(1) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u878d\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u6807\u70b9\u589e\u5f3a\u8fb9\u754c\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u805a\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff1b(2) \u5f15\u5165\u6781\u7aef\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u7a33\u5b9a\u6781\u4f4etoken\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6bd4\u4e0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u901a\u7528\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4e2d\uff0cPHSA\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bc6\u96c6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53caSOTA\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982InfLLM v2\uff09\uff1b\u572832k-token\u8f93\u5165\u300197.3%\u7a00\u758f\u7387\u4e0b\uff0c0.6B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u964d\u4f4e10.8%\u3002", "conclusion": "PHSA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

This paper introduces the Quantum Neural Tangent Kernel-Upper Confidence Bound (QNTK-UCB) algorithm, a novel algorithm that leverages the Quantum Neural Tangent Kernel (QNTK) to address these limitations.\n  By freezing the QNN at a random initialization and utilizing its static QNTK as a kernel for ridge regression, QNTK-UCB bypasses the unstable training dynamics inherent in explicit parameterized quantum circuit training while fully exploiting the unique quantum inductive bias. For a time horizon $T$ and $K$ actions, our theoretical analysis reveals a significantly improved parameter scaling of $\u03a9((TK)^3)$ for QNTK-UCB, a substantial reduction compared to $\u03a9((TK)^8)$ required by classical NeuralUCB algorithms for similar regret guarantees. Empirical evaluations on non-linear synthetic benchmarks and quantum-native variational quantum eigensolver tasks demonstrate QNTK-UCB's superior sample efficiency in low-data regimes.

A Lyapunov-based analysis establishes probabilistic ultimate boundedness of the pose tracking error under bounded GP uncertainty, providing formal stability guarantees for the learning-based controller.\n  Simulation results demonstrate accurate and smooth trajectory tracking in the presence of realistic, localized disturbances, including correlated rotational and translational effects arising from magnetometer perturbations.

To address this, a progressive Earth vision-language understanding and generation framework is proposed, including a multi-task dataset (EarthVLSet) and a semantic-guided network (EarthVLNet). Focusing on city planning applications, EarthVLSet includes 10.9k sub-meter resolution remote sensing images, land-cover masks, and 761.5k textual pairs involving both multiple-choice and open-ended visual question answering (VQA) tasks. In an object-centric way, EarthVLNet is proposed to progressively achieve semantic segmentation, relational reasoning, and comprehensive understanding. The first stage involves land-cover segmentation to generate object semantics for VQA guidance. Guided by pixel-wise semantics, the object awareness based large language model (LLM) performs relational reasoning and knowledge summarization to generate the required answers. As for optimization, the numerical difference loss is proposed to dynamically add difference penalties, addressing the various objects' statistics. Three benchmarks, including semantic segmentation, multiple-choice, and open-ended VQA demonstrated the superiorities of EarthVLNet, yielding three future directions: 1) segmentation features consistently enhance VQA performance even in cross-dataset scenarios; 2) multiple-choice tasks show greater sensitivity to the vision encoder than to the language decoder; and 3) open-ended tasks necessitate advanced vision encoders and language decoders for an optimal performance.

The study aims to develop a robust regression model that can generalize across domains by training on 60 second labeled sequences of 1 Hz surface drilling data to predict the SSI. The model is tested in wells that are different from those used during training. To fine-tune the model architecture, a grid search approach is employed to optimize key hyperparameters. A comparative analysis of the Adversarial Domain Generalization (ADG), Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) and baseline models is presented, along with an evaluation of the effectiveness of transfer learning (TL) in improving model performance. The ADG and IRM models achieve performance improvements of 10% and 8%, respectively, over the baseline model. Most importantly, severe events are detected 60% of the time, against 20% for the baseline model. Overall, the results indicate that both ADG and IRM models surpass the baseline, with the ADG model exhibiting a slight advantage over the IRM model.

We present a practical framework that constructs high-quality digital twins within minutes from sparse RGB inputs.

We enhance 3DGS with visibility-aware semantic fusion for accurate 3D labelling and introduce an efficient, filter-based geometry conversion method to produce collision-ready models seamlessly integrated with a Unity-ROS2-MoveIt physics engine. In experiments with a Franka Emika Panda robot performing pick-and-place tasks, we demonstrate that this enhanced geometric accuracy effectively supports robust manipulation in real-world trials.

Its input style conditions typically include text, style image, and stylized first frame. Each condition has a characteristic advantage: text is more flexible, style image provides a more accurate visual anchor, and stylized first frame makes long-video stylization feasible. However, existing methods are largely confined to a single type of style condition, which limits their scope of application. Additionally, their lack of high-quality datasets leads to style inconsistency and temporal flicker. To address these limitations, we introduce DreamStyle, a unified framework for video stylization, supporting (1) text-guided, (2) style-image-guided, and (3) first-frame-guided video stylization, accompanied by a well-designed data curation pipeline to acquire high-quality paired video data. DreamStyle is built on a vanilla Image-to-Video (I2V) model and trained using a Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with token-specific up matrices that reduces the confusion among different condition tokens. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that DreamStyle is competent in all three video stylization tasks, and outperforms the competitors in style consistency and video quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "DreamStyle\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u652f\u6301\u6587\u672c\u3001\u98ce\u683c\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u9996\u5e27\u4e09\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u9891\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u7684LoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u63d0\u5347\u98ce\u683c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u98ce\u683c\u6761\u4ef6\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u98ce\u683c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u95ea\u70c1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840Image-to-Video\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9762\u5411token\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff08LoRA\uff09\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e13\u7528\u6570\u636e\u6e05\u6d17\u6d41\u7a0b\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u914d\u5bf9\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u98ce\u683c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "DreamStyle\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u6761\u4ef6\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u9891\u98ce\u683c\u5316\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

TiMem is characterized by three core properties: (1) temporal--hierarchical organization through TMT; (2) semantic-guided consolidation that enables memory integration across hierarchical levels without fine-tuning; and (3) complexity-aware memory recall that balances precision and efficiency across queries of varying complexity. Under a consistent evaluation setup, TiMem achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on both benchmarks, reaching 75.30% on LoCoMo and 76.88% on LongMemEval-S. It outperforms all evaluated baselines while reducing the recalled memory length by 52.20% on LoCoMo.

Although large-scale models provide effective solutions for perception and reasoning, their practical deployment on assistive devices is severely constrained by excessive memory consumption and high inference costs. Moreover, existing quantization strategies often ignore inter-block error accumulation, leading to degraded model stability. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel quantization framework -- Residual-Projected Multi-Collaboration Closed-Loop and Single Instance Quantization(RPIQ), whose quantization process adopts a multi-collaborative closed-loop compensation scheme based on Single Instance Calibration and Gauss-Seidel Iterative Quantization. Experiments on various types of large-scale models, including language models such as OPT, Qwen, and LLaMA, as well as vision-language models such as CogVLM2, demonstrate that RPIQ can compress models to 4-bit representation while significantly reducing peak memory consumption (approximately 60%-75% reduction compared to original full-precision models). The method maintains performance highly close to full-precision models across multiple language and visual tasks, and exhibits excellent recognition and reasoning capabilities in key applications such as text understanding and visual question answering in complex scenarios. While verifying the effectiveness of RPIQ for deployment in real assistive systems, this study also advances the computational efficiency and reliability of large models, enabling them to provide visually impaired users with the required information accurately and rapidly.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aRPIQ\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u534f\u4f5c\u95ed\u73af\u8865\u507f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u57284\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5316\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\uff0860%-75%\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u63a5\u8fd1\u5168\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u969c\u8f85\u52a9\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u969c\u7528\u6237\u4e9f\u9700\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u3001\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u8f85\u52a9\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3001\u73b0\u6709\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u5757\u95f4\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faResidual-Projected Multi-Collaboration Closed-Loop and Single Instance Quantization (RPIQ)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5355\u6837\u672c\u6821\u51c6\u4e0e\u9ad8\u65af-\u8d5b\u5fb7\u5c14\u8fed\u4ee3\u91cf\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u534f\u4f5c\u95ed\u73af\u8865\u507f\u3002", "result": "\u5728OPT\u3001Qwen\u3001LLaMA\u3001CogVLM2\u7b49\u591a\u7c7b\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b04-bit\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u5cf0\u503c\u5185\u5b58\u964d\u4f4e60%-75%\uff0c\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u5168\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6587\u672c\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "RPIQ\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8f85\u52a9\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u969c\u7528\u6237\u5b9e\u65f6\u83b7\u53d6\u51c6\u786e\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Unlike existing siloed tools where pattern software guarantees sewable outputs but understands nothing about drape, and physics simulation predicts behaviour but cannot automatically fix patterns, Textile IR provides the semantic glue for integration through a seven-layer Verification Ladder -- from cheap syntactic checks (pattern closure, seam compatibility) to expensive physics validation (drape simulation, stress analysis). The architecture enables bidirectional feedback: simulation failures suggest pattern modifications; material substitutions update sustainability estimates in real time; uncertainty propagates across the pipeline with explicit confidence bounds. We formalise fashion engineering as constraint satisfaction over three domains and demonstrate how Textile IR's scene-graph representation enables AI systems to manipulate garments as structured programs rather than pixel arrays. The framework addresses the compound uncertainty problem: when measurement errors in material testing, simulation approximations, and LCA database gaps combine, sustainability claims become unreliable without explicit uncertainty tracking. We propose six research priorities and discuss deployment considerations for fashion SMEs where integrated workflows reduce specialised engineering requirements.

Methodological Considerations for Measuring Cultural Alignment in LLMs", "comment": "IJCNLP-AACL 2025", "summary": "Socio-demographic prompting (SDP) - prompting Large Language Models (LLMs) using demographic proxies to generate culturally aligned outputs - often shows LLM responses as stereotypical and biased. While effective in assessing LLMs' cultural competency, SDP is prone to confounding factors such as prompt sensitivity, decoding parameters, and the inherent difficulty of generation over discrimination tasks due to larger output spaces. These factors complicate interpretation, making it difficult to determine if the poor performance is due to bias or the task design. To address this, we use inverse socio-demographic prompting (ISDP), where we prompt LLMs to discriminate and predict the demographic proxy from actual and simulated user behavior from different users. We use the Goodreads-CSI dataset (Saha et al., 2025), which captures difficulty in understanding English book reviews for users from India, Mexico, and the USA, and test four LLMs: Aya-23, Gemma-2, GPT-4o, and LLaMA-3.1 with ISDP.

Existing solutions face a dilemma: manual prompt engineering is intuitive but unscalable and imprecise, while automatic optimization methods are effective but operate as \"black boxes\" with no interpretable connection to model internals. We propose a novel framework that adapts gradient ascent to LLMs, enabling targeted prompt discovery. In specific, we propose two methods, RESGA and SAEGA, that both optimize randomly initialized prompts to achieve better aligned representation with an identified persona direction. We introduce fluent gradient ascent to control the fluency of discovered persona steering prompts. We demonstrate RESGA and SAEGA's effectiveness across Llama 3.1, Qwen 2.5, and Gemma 3 for steering three different personas,sycophancy, hallucination, and myopic reward. Crucially, on sycophancy, our automatically discovered prompts achieve significant improvement (49.90% compared with 79.24%).

We propose a novel approach that adapts any state-of-the-art image-based (depth) estimation model for video processing by integrating a new temporal module - trainable on a single GPU in a few days. Our architecture StableDPT builds upon an off-the-shelf Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder and enhances the Dense Prediction Transformer (DPT) head. The core of our contribution lies in the temporal layers within the head, which use an efficient cross-attention mechanism to integrate information from keyframes sampled across the entire video sequence.

Furthermore, we propose a novel inference strategy for processing videos of arbitrary length avoiding the scale misalignment and redundant computations associated with overlapping windows used in other methods.

Despite this non-uniqueness, language models are typically trained using a single canonical longest-prefix tokenization. We formalize homotokens-alternative valid subword segmentations of the same lexical item-as a strictly meaning-preserving form of data augmentation. We introduce a lightweight training architecture that conditions canonical next-token prediction on sampled homotoken variants via an auxiliary causal encoder and block-causal cross-attention, without modifying the training objective or token interface. In data-constrained pretraining, homotoken augmentation consistently delays overfitting under repeated data exposure and improves generalization across diverse evaluation datasets. In multilingual fine-tuning, we find that the effectiveness of homotokens depends on tokenizer quality: gains are strongest when canonical tokens are highly compressed and diminish when the tokenizer already over-fragments the input.

Unlike single-molecule pre-trained LLMs constrained to specific applications, ChemBART addresses broader chemical challenges and integrates them for comprehensive synthesis planning. Crucially, ChemBART-designed multi-step synthesis routes and reaction conditions directly inspired wet-lab validation, which confirmed shorter pathways with ~30% yield improvement over literature benchmarks.

However, compared with the commonly used Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining, IHC staining involves complex procedures and is both time-consuming and expensive, which limits its widespread clinical use. Virtual staining converts H&E images to IHC images, offering a cost-effective alternative to clinical IHC staining. Nevertheless, using adjacent slides as ground truth often results in weakly-paired data with spatial misalignment and local deformations, hindering effective supervised learning. To address these challenges, we propose a novel topology-aware framework for H&E-to-IHC virtual staining. Specifically, we introduce a Topology-aware Consistency Matching (TACM) mechanism that employs graph contrastive learning and topological perturbations to learn robust matching patterns despite spatial misalignments, ensuring structural consistency. Furthermore, we propose a Topology-constrained Pathological Matching (TCPM) mechanism that aligns pathological positive regions based on node importance to enhance pathological consistency.

Current long-context benchmarks often trade off scalability and realism: synthetic tasks underrepresent real-world complexity, while fully manual annotation is costly to scale to extreme lengths and diverse scenarios. We present LongBench Pro, a more realistic and comprehensive bilingual benchmark of 1,500 naturally occurring long-context samples in English and Chinese spanning 11 primary tasks and 25 secondary tasks, with input lengths from 8k to 256k tokens. LongBench Pro supports fine-grained analysis with task-specific metrics and a multi-dimensional taxonomy of context requirement (full vs. partial dependency), length (six levels), and difficulty (four levels calibrated by model performance). To balance quality with scalability, we propose a Human-Model Collaborative Construction pipeline: frontier LLMs draft challenging questions and reference answers, along with design rationales and solution processes, to reduce the cost of expert verification. Experts then rigorously validate correctness and refine problematic cases. Evaluating 46 widely used long-context LLMs on LongBench Pro yields three findings: (1) long-context optimization contributes more to long-context comprehension than parameter scaling; (2) effective context length is typically shorter than the claimed context length, with pronounced cross-lingual misalignment; and (3) the \"thinking\" paradigm helps primarily models trained with native reasoning, while mixed-thinking designs offer a promising Pareto trade-off.

In contrast, humans often employ sketch-style reasoning: a concise, goal-directed cognitive process that prioritizes salient information and enables efficient problem-solving. Inspired by this cognitive efficiency, we propose SketchThinker-R1, which incentivizes sketch-style reasoning ability in large multimodal models. Our method consists of three primary stages. In the Sketch-Mode Cold Start stage, we convert standard long reasoning process into sketch-style reasoning and finetune base multimodal model, instilling initial sketch-style reasoning capability. Next, we train SketchJudge Reward Model, which explicitly evaluates thinking process of model and assigns higher scores to sketch-style reasoning. Finally, we conduct Sketch-Thinking Reinforcement Learning under supervision of SketchJudge to further generalize sketch-style reasoning ability. Experimental evaluation on four benchmarks reveals that our SketchThinker-R1 achieves over 64% reduction in reasoning token cost without compromising final answer accuracy. Qualitative analysis further shows that sketch-style reasoning focuses more on key cues during problem solving.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSketchThinker-R1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u4eff\u4eba\u7c7b\u8349\u56fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\uff08\u7b80\u6d01\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u3001\u805a\u7126\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4etoken\u6d88\u8017\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u957f\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u867d\u6709\u6548\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff08\u9ad8token\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u54cd\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7b80\u660e\u7684\u8349\u56fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5efa\u6a21\u5e76\u6fc0\u53d1\u6b64\u7c7b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09Sketch-Mode\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u2014\u2014\u5c06\u957f\u63a8\u7406\u84b8\u998f\u4e3a\u8349\u56fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u5e76\u5fae\u8c03\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3SketchJudge\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e76\u5956\u52b1\u8349\u56fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b3\uff09\u57fa\u4e8eSketchJudge\u8fdb\u884c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6cdb\u5316\u8349\u56fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d8564%\u7684\u63a8\u7406token\u6210\u672c\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e14\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u672a\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u5173\u6ce8\u89e3\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8349\u56fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0cSketchThinker-R1\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Previous works have demonstrated promising results in applying LLM's towards compressing not only text, but also a wide range of multi-modal data. Despite the favorable performance achieved, there still remains several practical questions that pose a challenge towards replacing existing data compression algorithms with LLM's. In this work, we explore different methods to achieve a lower adjusted compression rate using LLM's as data compressors.

We address this by placing a code-oriented LLM within a closed-loop synthesis framework, analyzing its evolution over 22 supervised fine-tuning cycles. The model synthesizes PyTorch convolutional networks which are validated, evaluated via low-fidelity performance signals (single-epoch accuracy), and filtered using a MinHash-Jaccard criterion to prevent structural redundancy. High-performing, novel architectures are converted into prompt-code pairs for iterative fine-tuning via parameter-efficient LoRA adaptation, initialized from the LEMUR dataset. Across cycles, the LLM internalizes empirical architectural priors, becoming a robust generator. The valid generation rate stabilizes at 50.6 percent (peaking at 74.5 percent), while mean first-epoch accuracy rises from 28.06 percent to 50.99 percent, and the fraction of candidates exceeding 40 percent accuracy grows from 2.04 percent to 96.81 percent. Analyses confirm the model moves beyond replicating existing motifs, synthesizing 455 high-performing architectures absent from the original corpus. By grounding code synthesis in execution feedback, this work provides a scalable blueprint for transforming stochastic generators into autonomous, performance-driven neural designers, establishing that LLMs can internalize empirical, non-textual rewards to transcend their training data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u4ee3\u7801\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5d4c\u5165\u95ed\u73af\u5408\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc722\u8f6e\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u81ea\u4e3b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u65b0\u9896\u7684PyTorch\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u5355\u8f6e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u9ad8\u8868\u73b0\u67b6\u6784\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5408\u6210\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u81ea\u4e3b\u8fdb\u884c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08\u9700\u517c\u987e\u8bed\u6cd5\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u65b0\u9896\u6027\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4ee3\u7801\u5bfc\u5411LLM\u7f6e\u4e8e\u95ed\u73af\u5408\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ecf22\u8f6e\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff1b\u6bcf\u8f6e\u751f\u6210PyTorch\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7528\u5355epoch\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4f4e\u4fdd\u771f\u6027\u80fd\u4fe1\u53f7\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u7528MinHash-Jaccard\u51c6\u5219\u53bb\u91cd\uff1b\u9ad8\u8868\u73b0\u3001\u65b0\u9896\u67b6\u6784\u8f6c\u4e3aprompt-code\u5bf9\uff0c\u91c7\u7528LoRA\u8fdb\u884c\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u81eaLEMUR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u7387\u7a33\u5b9a\u572850.6%\uff08\u5cf0\u503c74.5%\uff09\uff0c\u9996epoch\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4ece28.06%\u5347\u81f350.99%\uff0c\u8d8540%\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5019\u9009\u67b6\u6784\u5360\u6bd4\u4ece2.04%\u5347\u81f396.81%\uff1b\u751f\u6210455\u4e2a\u539f\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u6267\u884c\u53cd\u9988\u5185\u5316\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6027\u67b6\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8005\uff1b\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5c06\u968f\u673a\u751f\u6210\u5668\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6027\u80fd\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u5b9eLLM\u80fd\u5185\u5316\u975e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u539f\u59cb\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3002"}}

We study the problem of constructing a conformal prediction set that is uniformly valid across multiple, heterogeneous distributions, in the sense that no matter which distribution the test point is from, the coverage of the prediction set is guaranteed to exceed a pre-specified level. We first propose a max-p aggregation scheme that delivers finite-sample, multi-distribution coverage given any conformity scores associated with each distribution. Upon studying several efficiency optimization programs subject to uniform coverage, we prove the optimality and tightness of our aggregation scheme, and propose a general algorithm to learn conformity scores that lead to efficient prediction sets after the aggregation under standard conditions. We discuss how our framework relates to group-wise distributionally robust optimization, sub-population shift, fairness, and multi-source learning. In synthetic and real-data experiments, our method delivers valid worst-case coverage across multiple distributions while greatly reducing the set size compared with naively applying max-p aggregation to single-source conformity scores, and can be comparable in size to single-source prediction sets with popular, standard conformity scores.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cdmax-p\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5f02\u8d28\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u6784\u5efa\u5177\u6709\u7edf\u4e00\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u548c\u7d27\u6027\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u9ad8\u6548\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5206\u6570\u7684\u901a\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c0f\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u80fd\u6765\u81ea\u591a\u4e2a\u6e90\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u610f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6216\u5176\u6df7\u5408\uff0c\u9700\u786e\u4fdd\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u5728\u6240\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u5747\u6ee1\u8db3\u9884\u8bbe\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u591a\u5206\u5e03\u8986\u76d6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51famax-p\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5404\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684 conformity scores \u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u5206\u5e03\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u5982\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\uff09\u5e76\u7ea6\u675f\u5747\u5300\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u4e0e\u7d27\u6027\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b66\u4e60\u9002\u914d\u8be5\u805a\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u7684 conformity scores\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u591a\u5206\u5e03\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u5c0f\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u5c3a\u5bf8\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u5bf9\u5355\u6e90 conformity scores \u5e94\u7528 max-p \u805a\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u53ef\u5ab2\u7f8e\u4f7f\u7528\u4e3b\u6d41\u6807\u51c6 conformity scores \u7684\u5355\u6e90\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "max-p \u805a\u5408\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u5206\u5e03\u7edf\u4e00\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u9c81\u68d2\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f53\u504f\u79fb\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u53ca\u591a\u6e90\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Although recent DETR-based detectors benefit from global context modeling, they exhibit notable performance degradation on IRSTD. We revisit this phenomenon and reveal that the target-relevant embeddings of IRST are inevitably overwhelmed by dominant background features due to the self-attention mechanism, leading to unreliable query initialization and inaccurate target localization. To address this issue, we propose SEF-DETR, a novel framework that refines query initialization for IRSTD. Specifically, SEF-DETR consists of three components: Frequency-guided Patch Screening (FPS), Dynamic Embedding Enhancement (DEE), and Reliability-Consistency-aware Fusion (RCF). The FPS module leverages the Fourier spectrum of local patches to construct a target-relevant density map, suppressing background-dominated features. DEE strengthens multi-scale representations in a target-aware manner, while RCF further refines object queries by enforcing spatial-frequency consistency and reliability.

However, different regional varieties often employ different scripts to write the same language, rendering speech recognition output also subject to non-determinism in the output script. To mitigate this problem, we show that script is linearly encoded in the activation space of multilingual speech models, and that modifying activations at inference time enables direct control over output script. We find the addition of such script vectors to activations at test time can induce script change even in unconventional language-script pairings (e.g. Italian in Cyrillic and Japanese in Latin script). We apply this approach to inducing post-hoc control over the script of speech recognition output, where we observe competitive performance across all model sizes of Whisper.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982Whisper\uff09\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6539\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5411\u91cf\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f93\u51fa\u6587\u5b57\u811a\u672c\uff08script\uff09\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u811a\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u5206\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u6dfb\u52a0\u811a\u672c\u5411\u91cf\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00-\u811a\u672c\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u811a\u672c\u5207\u6362\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982Whisper\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5305\u542b\u540c\u4e00\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u533a\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d8\u4f53\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u6587\u5b57\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u811a\u672c\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u8f93\u51fa\u811a\u672c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u63a7\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790Whisper\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u811a\u672c\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u5206\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u811a\u672c\u65b9\u5411\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5c06\u8be5\u5411\u91cf\u52a0\u5230\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e0a\u4ee5\u63a7\u5236\u8f93\u51fa\u811a\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5728Whisper\u5404\u5c3a\u5bf8\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5747\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff1a\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bf1\u5bfc\u811a\u672c\u5207\u6362\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u975e\u5e38\u89c4\u914d\u5bf9\uff0c\u5982\u610f\u5927\u5229\u8bed\u7528\u897f\u91cc\u5c14\u5b57\u6bcd\u3001\u65e5\u8bed\u7528\u62c9\u4e01\u5b57\u6bcd\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u811a\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5448\u7ebf\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u540e\u7f6e\u811a\u672c\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u8f93\u51fa\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u548c\u672c\u5730\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

To recover from poor priors resulting from training on sub-optimal data, our online inference follows an Upper-Confidence Bound rule that favours exploration and adaptation. We prove that SPICE achieves regret-optimal behaviour in both stochastic bandits and finite-horizon MDPs, even when pretrained only on suboptimal trajectories.

We present several key adaptations to diffusion models, which are important in this discrete setting. Notably, we show that a location-aware palette with our 2D gray code ordering improves performance. Adding a final tanh activation function is crucial for discrete data. On optimizing diffusion parameters, the sigmoid loss weighting consistently outperforms alternatives, regardless of the prediction type used, and we settle on x-prediction. While our current model does not yet surpass leading mask-based architectures, it narrows the performance gap and introduces unique capabilities, such as principled ambiguity modeling, that these models lack.

However, a critical paradox persists within the current field: despite the empirical efficacy, our theoretical understanding of LLMs remains disproportionately nascent, forcing these systems to be treated largely as ``black boxes''. To address this theoretical fragmentation, this survey proposes a unified lifecycle-based taxonomy that organizes the research landscape into six distinct stages: Data Preparation, Model Preparation, Training, Alignment, Inference, and Evaluation. Within this framework, we provide a systematic review of the foundational theories and internal mechanisms driving LLM performance. Specifically, we analyze core theoretical issues such as the mathematical justification for data mixtures, the representational limits of various architectures, and the optimization dynamics of alignment algorithms. Moving beyond current best practices, we identify critical frontier challenges, including the theoretical limits of synthetic data self-improvement, the mathematical bounds of safety guarantees, and the mechanistic origins of emergent intelligence.

We posit that sensitive attributes (e.g., race, gender) do not merely shift data distributions but causally warp the geometry of the data manifold itself. To address this, we introduce Causal Manifold Fairness (CMF), a novel framework that bridges causal inference and geometric deep learning. CMF learns a latent representation where the local Riemannian geometry, defined by the metric tensor and curvature, remains invariant under counterfactual interventions on sensitive attributes. By enforcing constraints on the Jacobian and Hessian of the decoder, CMF ensures that the rules of the latent space (distances and shapes) are preserved across demographic groups. We validate CMF on synthetic Structural Causal Models (SCMs), demonstrating that it effectively disentangles sensitive geometric warping while preserving task utility, offering a rigorous quantification of the fairness-utility trade-off via geometric metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u56e0\u679c\u6d41\u5f62\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff08CMF\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\u5e72\u9884\u4e0b\u7684\u9ece\u66fc\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u672c\u8d28\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u6570\u636e\u7684\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u800c\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u4f1a\u56e0\u679c\u5730\u626d\u66f2\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u9700\u4ece\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u56e0\u679c\u8054\u5408\u89c6\u89d2\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCMF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u548c\u6d77\u68ee\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u5c40\u90e8\u9ece\u66fc\u5ea6\u91cf\u5f20\u91cf\u4e0e\u66f2\u7387\u5728\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5e72\u9884\u4e0b\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\uff08SCM\uff09\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86CMF\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u8026\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u626d\u66f2\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u6307\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u516c\u5e73\u6027-\u6548\u7528\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "CMF\u4e3a\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u51e0\u4f55-\u56e0\u679c\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4fdd\u969c\u6d41\u5f62\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u6df1\u5c42\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Recent state-of-the-art methods leverage large language models (LLMs) to provide detailed moment descriptions for video data. However, existing VideoLLMs remain challenging in identifying precise event boundaries in untrimmed videos, causing the generated captions to be not properly grounded. In this paper, we propose TA-Prompting, which enhances VideoLLMs via Temporal Anchors that learn to precisely localize events and prompt the VideoLLMs to perform temporal-aware video event understanding. During inference, in order to properly determine the output caption sequence from an arbitrary number of events presented within a video, we introduce an event coherent sampling strategy to select event captions with sufficient coherence across temporal events and cross-modal similarity with the given video.

If successful, this approach offers one of the most promising routes for human oversight in AI safety. We conduct an initial stress-test of these claims by replicating their main results with open-source SAEs for Llama 3.1. While we successfully reproduce basic feature extraction and steering capabilities, our investigation suggests that major caution is warranted regarding the generalizability of these claims. We find that feature steering exhibits substantial fragility, with sensitivity to layer selection, steering magnitude, and context. We observe non-standard activation behavior and demonstrate the difficulty to distinguish thematically similar features from one another. While SAE-based interpretability produces compelling demonstrations in selected cases, current methods often fall short of the systematic reliability required for safety-critical applications. This suggests a necessary shift in focus from prioritizing interpretability of internal representations toward reliable prediction and control of model output.

Previous methods typically focus on predicting numerical scores without explanation or provide low-level descriptions lacking precise scores. Recent reasoning-based vision language models (VLMs) have shown strong potential for IQA, enabling joint generation of quality descriptions and scores. However, we notice that existing VLM-based IQA methods tend to exhibit unreliable reasoning due to their limited capability of integrating visual and textual cues. In this work, we introduce Zoom-IQA, a VLM-based IQA model to explicitly emulate key cognitive behaviors: uncertainty awareness, region reasoning, and iterative refinement. Specifically, we present a two-stage training pipeline: 1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our Grounded-Rationale-IQA (GR-IQA) dataset to teach the model to ground its assessments in key regions; and 2) reinforcement learning (RL) for dynamic policy exploration, primarily stabilized by our KL-Coverage regularizer to prevent reasoning and scoring diversity collapse, and supported by a Progressive Re-sampling Strategy to mitigate annotation bias. Extensive experiments show that Zoom-IQA achieves improved robustness, explainability, and generalization. The application to downstream tasks, such as image restoration, further demonstrates the effectiveness of Zoom-IQA.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faZoom-IQA\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0e\u5e26KL-Coverage\u6b63\u5219\u548c\u6e10\u8fdb\u91cd\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u6a21\u62df\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u533a\u57df\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u7b49\u8ba4\u77e5\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eVLM\u7684IQA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u7ebf\u7d22\u65b9\u9762\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff1b\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5173\u952e\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u8ba4\u77e5\u5c42\u9762\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faZoom-IQA\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1a1\uff09\u5728\u81ea\u5efaGR-IQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u5173\u952e\u56fe\u50cf\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b2\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5f15\u5165KL-Coverage\u6b63\u5219\u9632\u6b62\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u8bc4\u5206\u591a\u6837\u6027\u574d\u7f29\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u6e10\u8fdb\u91cd\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u7f13\u89e3\u6807\u6ce8\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "Zoom-IQA\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u7b49\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u884c\u4e3a\uff08\u5982\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u533a\u57df\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\uff09\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347VLM-based IQA\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Existing KV-cache compression methods rely on rigid heuristics, disrupt tensor layouts, or require specialized compute, hindering scalability and deployment.\n  We propose joint encoding of KV-cache blocks, which fuses similar blocks across requests and input chunks into shared representations while preserving standard cache structure. This alleviates the KV-cache memory bottleneck, supporting high-concurrency serving without specialized hardware. Theoretically, we analyze the rate-distortion tradeoff of fused cache blocks under a Poisson process model.

The challenges of multi-modal vehicle ReID arise from the uncertainty of modality quality distribution induced by inherent discrepancies across modalities, resulting in distinct conflicting fusion requirements for data with balanced and unbalanced quality distributions. Existing methods handle all multi-modal data within a single fusion model, overlooking the different needs of the two data types and making it difficult to decouple the conflict between intra-class consistency and inter-modal heterogeneity. To this end, we propose Disentangle Collaboration and Guidance Fusion Representations for Multi-modal Vehicle ReID (DCG-ReID). Specifically, to disentangle heterogeneous quality-distributed modal data without mutual interference, we first design the Dynamic Confidence-based Disentangling Weighting (DCDW) mechanism: dynamically reweighting three-modal contributions via interaction-derived modal confidence to build a disentangled fusion framework. Building on DCDW, we develop two scenario-specific fusion strategies: (1) for balanced quality distributions, Collaboration Fusion Module (CFM) mines pairwise consensus features to capture shared discriminative information and boost intra-class consistency; (2) for unbalanced distributions, Guidance Fusion Module (GFM) implements differential amplification of modal discriminative disparities to reinforce dominant modality advantages, guide auxiliary modalities to mine complementary discriminative info, and mitigate inter-modal divergence to boost multi-modal joint decision performance. Extensive experiments on three multi-modal ReID benchmarks (WMVeID863, MSVR310, RGBNT100) validate the effectiveness of our method.

We propose a controlled Knowledge Graph-based synthetic framework that generates text from symmetric/inverse triples, train GPT-style autoregressive models from scratch, and evaluate memorization, logical inference, and in-context generalization to unseen entities to address these questions. We find a sharp phase transition in which relational semantics emerge with sufficient logic-bearing supervision, even in shallow (2-3 layer) models, and that successful generalization aligns with stable intermediate-layer signals.

Such multi-dimensional, heterogeneous data occurs mostly in today's industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), where real-time detection of anomalies is critical to prevent impending failures and resolve them in a timely manner. However, existing anomaly detection methods often fall short of effectively coping with the complexity and dynamism of multi-dimensional data streams in IIoT. In this paper, we propose an adaptive method for detecting anomalies in IIoT streaming data utilizing a multi-source prediction model and concept drift adaptation. The proposed anomaly detection algorithm merges a prediction model into a novel drift adaptation method resulting in accurate and efficient anomaly detection that exhibits improved scalability. Our trace-driven evaluations indicate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods by achieving up to an 89.71% accuracy (in terms of Area under the Curve (AUC)) while meeting the given efficiency and scalability requirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u5de5\u4e1a\u7269\u8054\u7f51\uff08IIoT\uff09\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u591a\u6e90\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u9002\u914d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0cAUC\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe89.71%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9IIoT\u4e2d\u591a\u7ef4\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u5f02\u6784\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6d41\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u65f6\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u5bf9\u9884\u9632\u6545\u969c\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u6e90\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5d4c\u5165\u6f02\u79fb\u9002\u914d\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u8f68\u8ff9\u9a71\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5AUC\u8fbe89.71%\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9IIoT\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Existing VAU approaches often rely on fine-tuned multimodal large language models (MLLMs) or external modules such as video captioners, which introduce costly annotations, complex training pipelines, and high inference overhead. In this work, we introduce PrismVAU, a lightweight yet effective system for real-time VAU that leverages a single off-the-shelf MLLM for anomaly scoring, explanation, and prompt optimization. PrismVAU operates in two complementary stages: (1) a coarse anomaly scoring module that computes frame-level anomaly scores via similarity to textual anchors, and (2) an MLLM-based refinement module that contextualizes anomalies through system and user prompts. Both textual anchors and prompts are optimized with a weakly supervised Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE) framework. Extensive experiments on standard VAD benchmarks demonstrate that PrismVAU delivers competitive detection performance and interpretable anomaly explanations -- without relying on instruction tuning, frame-level annotations, and external modules or dense processing -- making it an efficient and practical solution for real-world applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "PrismVAU\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5b9e\u65f6\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u7406\u89e3\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ec5\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u73b0\u6210\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLM\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u951a\u70b9\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0e\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u7cbe\u7ec6\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u5916\u90e8\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u5982\u89c6\u9891\u63cf\u8ff0\u5668\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u590d\u6742\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u7528\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u951a\u70b9\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u5e27\u7ea7\u5f02\u5e38\u8bc4\u5206\uff1b2\uff09\u5229\u7528MLLM\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5316\u5f02\u5e38\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0e\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\uff1b\u5168\u7a0b\u91c7\u7528\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\uff08APE\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u951a\u70b9\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6VAD\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u5e27\u7ea7\u6807\u6ce8\u3001\u5916\u90e8\u6a21\u5757\u6216\u5bc6\u96c6\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "conclusion": "PrismVAU\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u90e8\u7f72\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

Auditing is proposed as an accountability tool for black-box LLM applications, but suffers from resource-intensive query access. We conceptualise auditing as uncertainty estimation over a target fairness metric and introduce BAFA, the Bounded Active Fairness Auditor for query-efficient auditing of black-box LLMs. BAFA maintains a version space of surrogate models consistent with queried scores and computes uncertainty intervals for fairness metrics (e.g., $\u0394$ AUC) via constrained empirical risk minimisation. Active query selection narrows these intervals to reduce estimation error. We evaluate BAFA on two standard fairness dataset case studies: \\textsc{CivilComments} and \\textsc{Bias-in-Bios}, comparing against stratified sampling, power sampling, and ablations. BAFA achieves target error thresholds with up to 40$\\times$ fewer queries than stratified sampling (e.g., 144 vs 5,956 queries at $\\varepsilon=0.02$ for \\textsc{CivilComments}) for tight thresholds, demonstrates substantially better performance over time, and shows lower variance across runs. These results suggest that active sampling can reduce resources needed for independent fairness auditing with LLMs, supporting continuous model evaluations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faBAFA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u754c\u4e3b\u52a8\u516c\u5e73\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u6b21\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u9ed1\u76d2\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e0a\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u9ed1\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5ba1\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u8d44\u6e90\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5ba1\u8ba1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u0394AUC\uff09\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1b\u63d0\u51faBAFA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u67e5\u8be2\u5f97\u5206\u7ef4\u62a4\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7248\u672c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u7ecf\u9a8c\u98ce\u9669\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6307\u6807\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u533a\u95f4\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u4e3b\u52a8\u67e5\u8be2\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u9010\u6b65\u7f29\u5c0f\u533a\u95f4\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u5728CivilComments\u548cBias-in-Bios\u4e24\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cBAFA\u5728\u03b5=0.02\u8bef\u5dee\u9608\u503c\u4e0b\u4ec5\u9700144\u6b21\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u6bd4\u5206\u5c42\u91c7\u6837\uff085956\u6b21\uff09\u51cf\u5c11\u8fbe40\u500d\uff1b\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u4f18\u3001\u8fd0\u884c\u65b9\u5dee\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "BAFA\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eLLM\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u72ec\u7acb\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6240\u9700\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6301\u7eed\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u8d23\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Though deep learning models have excellent fault detection capabilities, almost all methods either are too large and heavy for edge computing devices or involve biased estimation of accuracy due to ineffective learning techniques. We propose a new solar panel fault detection model called HybridSolarNet. It integrates EfficientNet-B0 with Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM). We implemented it on the Kaggle Solar Panel Images competition dataset with a tight split-before-augmentation protocol. It avoids leakage in accuracy estimation. We introduced focal loss and cosine annealing. Ablation analysis validates that accuracy boosts due to added benefits from CBAM (+1.53%) and that there are benefits from recognition of classes with imbalanced samples via focal loss. Overall average accuracy on 5-fold stratified cross-validation experiments on the given competition dataset topped 92.37% +/- 0.41 and an F1-score of 0.9226 +/- 0.39 compared to baselines like VGG19, requiring merely 16.3 MB storage, i.e., 32 times less. Its inference speed measured at 54.9 FPS with GPU support makes it a successful candidate for real-time UAV implementation.

While prior studies attribute this advantage to the superior English-centric capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we find that such measurements are significantly distorted by structural priors inherent in evaluation benchmarks. Specifically, we identify exposure bias and a gold availability prior-both driven by the disproportionate concentration of resources in English-as well as cultural priors rooted in topic locality, as factors that hinder accurate assessment of genuine language preference. To address these biases, we propose DeLP (Debiased Language Preference), a calibrated metric designed to explicitly factor out these structural confounds. Our analysis using DeLP reveals that the previously reported English preference is largely a byproduct of evidence distribution rather than an inherent model bias. Instead, we find that retrievers fundamentally favor monolingual alignment between the query and the document language. Building on this insight, we introduce DELTA (DEbiased Language preference-guided Text Augmentation), a lightweight and efficient mRAG framework that strategically leverages monolingual alignment to optimize cross-lingual retrieval and generation. Experimental results demonstrate that DELTA consistently outperforms English pivoting and mRAG baselines across diverse languages.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08mRAG\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6240\u8c13\u2018\u82f1\u8bed\u504f\u597d\u2019\u5b9e\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u6240\u81f4\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u53bb\u504f\u6307\u6807DeLP\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u8bed\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b0\u53d1\u73b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f7b\u91cf\u6846\u67b6DELTA\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5c06mRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u82f1\u8bed\u504f\u597d\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u82f1\u8bed\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4f5c\u8005\u6307\u51fa\u8be5\u7ed3\u8bba\u53d7\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u4e2d\u66b4\u9732\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u9ec4\u91d1\u7b54\u6848\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u6587\u5316\u4e3b\u9898\u504f\u5dee\u7b49\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5148\u9a8c\u4e25\u91cd\u626d\u66f2\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53bb\u504f\u8bed\u8a00\u504f\u597d\u6307\u6807DeLP\u4ee5\u6821\u6b63\u8bc4\u4f30\u504f\u5dee\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7DeLP\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u672c\u8d28\u504f\u597d\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0e\u6587\u6863\u7684\u5355\u8bed\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u636e\u6b64\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f7b\u91cfmRAG\u6846\u67b6DELTA\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5355\u8bed\u5bf9\u9f50\u4f18\u5316\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "DeLP\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5148\u524d\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u82f1\u8bed\u504f\u597d\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6a21\u578b\u56fa\u6709\u504f\u89c1\uff1bDELTA\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u82f1\u8bed\u4e2d\u8f6c\u53ca\u4e3b\u6d41mRAG\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "mRAG\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u504f\u597d\u95ee\u9898\u672c\u8d28\u662f\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u9677\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u7279\u6027\u5171\u540c\u5bfc\u81f4\uff0c\u800c\u975eLLM\u672c\u8eab\u82f1\u8bed\u504f\u5411\uff1b\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u5728\u516c\u5e73\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0b\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5021\u5bfc\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u8bed\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, most existing approaches rely on fixed steering policies and static intervention strengths, which limit their robustness across problem instances and often result in over- or under-steering. We propose Adaptive Test-time Latent Steering, called (ATLAS), a task-specific framework that dynamically controls steering decisions at inference time using an external, lightweight latent verifier. Given intermediate hidden states, the verifier predicts the quality of ongoing reasoning and adaptively selects whether and how strongly to apply steering, enabling per-example and per-step adjustment with minimal overhead. To our knowledge, ATLAS is the first method to integrate learned latent verification into test-time steering for enhancing LLMs reasoning.

Two critical limitations in the field are addressed. First, individual detection methods exhibit complementary strengths and weaknesses depending on data characteristics, making method selection non-trivial and prone to suboptimal results. Second, automated, contextual explanations for detected changes are largely absent. The proposed ensemble method aggregates results from ten distinct changepoint detection algorithms, achieving superior performance and robustness compared to individual methods. Additionally, an LLM-powered explanation pipeline automatically generates contextual narratives, linking detected changepoints to potential real-world historical events. For private or domain-specific data, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solution enables explanations grounded in user-provided documents.

Previous sEMG-to-text studies mainly focused on recognizing letters directly from sEMG signals, forming an important first step toward translating muscle activity into text. Building on this foundation, we present MyoText, a hierarchical framework that decodes sEMG signals to text through physiologically grounded intermediate stages. MyoText first classifies finger activations from multichannel sEMG using a CNN-BiLSTM-Attention model, applies ergonomic typing priors to infer letters, and reconstructs full sentences with a fine-tuned T5 transformer. This modular design mirrors the natural hierarchy of typing, linking muscle intent to language output and reducing the search space for decoding. Evaluated on 30 users from the emg2qwerty dataset, MyoText outperforms baselines by achieving 85.4% finger-classification accuracy, 5.4% character error rate (CER), and 6.5% word error rate (WER). Beyond accuracy gains, this methodology establishes a principled pathway from neuromuscular signals to text, providing a blueprint for virtual and augmented-reality typing interfaces that operate entirely without physical keyboards. By integrating ergonomic structure with transformer-based linguistic reasoning, MyoText advances the feasibility of seamless, wearable neural input for future ubiquitous computing environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "MyoText is a hierarchical sEMG-to-text framework that decodes finger activations via CNN-BiLSTM-Attention, applies ergonomic priors for letter inference, and uses a fine-tuned T5 transformer for sentence reconstruction\u2014achieving 85.4% finger accuracy, 5.4% CER, and 6.5% WER on 30 users.", "motivation": "To advance keyboard-free text input in wearable and mixed-reality systems by moving beyond direct letter recognition to a physiologically and ergonomically grounded hierarchical decoding process.", "method": "A three-stage hierarchical framework: (1) finger activation classification using CNN-BiLSTM-Attention on multichannel sEMG; (2) letter inference incorporating ergonomic typing priors; (3) full sentence reconstruction with a fine-tuned T5 transformer.", "result": "On the emg2qwerty dataset with 30 users: 85.4% finger-classification accuracy, 5.4% character error rate (CER), and 6.5% word error rate (WER); outperforms prior baselines.", "conclusion": "MyoText establishes a principled, modular pathway from neuromuscular signals to natural language, enabling high-accuracy, keyboard-free typing for virtual/augmented reality and ubiquitous computing."}}

This technique, Latent and Attention Mixing with Schedulers (LAMS), integrates with Prompt-to-Prompt (P2P) to form LAMS-Edit--an extensible framework that supports precise editing with region masks and enables style transfer via LoRA.

This study addresses the critical need for accurate digitization of Bahnar language documents through optical character recognition (OCR) technology. Digitizing scanned paper documents poses significant challenges, as degraded image quality from broken or blurred areas introduces considerable OCR errors that compromise information retrieval systems. We propose a comprehensive approach combining advanced table and non-table detection techniques with probability-based post-processing heuristics to enhance recognition accuracy. Our method first applies detection algorithms to improve input data quality, then employs probabilistic error correction on OCR output.

SC has been successful in diverse applications, but existing methods typically treat the ordering of pre-intervention time indices interchangeable.

We propose Time-Aware Synthetic Control (TASC), which employs a state-space model with a constant trend while preserving a low-rank structure of the signal. TASC uses the Kalman filter and Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother: it first fits a generative time-series model with expectation-maximization and then performs counterfactual inference.

Adaptive self-consistency methods mitigate this issue by adjusting the sampling budget; however, they rely on count-based stopping rules that treat all responses equally, often leading to unnecessary sampling. We propose Reliability-Aware Adaptive Self-Consistency (ReASC), which addresses this limitation by reframing adaptive sampling from response counting to evidence sufficiency, leveraging response-level confidence for principled information aggregation. ReASC operates in two stages: a single-sample decision stage that resolves instances confidently answerable from a single response, and a reliability-aware accumulation stage that aggregates responses by jointly leveraging their frequency and confidence. Across five models and four datasets, ReASC consistently achieves the best accuracy-cost trade-off compared to existing baselines, yielding improved inference efficiency across model scales from 3B to 27B parameters. As a concrete example, ReASC reduces inference cost by up to 70\\% relative to self-consistency while preserving accuracy on GSM8K using Gemma-3-4B-it.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u81ea\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08ReASC\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91c7\u6837\u4ece\u54cd\u5e94\u8ba1\u6570\u8f6c\u5411\u8bc1\u636e\u5145\u5206\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u54cd\u5e94\u7ea7\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u4fe1\u606f\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff1b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7b49\u540c\u5bf9\u5f85\u6240\u6709\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u8ba1\u6570\u578b\u505c\u6b62\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5197\u4f59\u91c7\u6837\u3002", "method": "ReASC\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u5355\u6837\u672c\u51b3\u7b56\u9636\u6bb5\uff08\u5bf9\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u76f4\u63a5\u7ed9\u51fa\u7b54\u6848\uff09\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7d2f\u79ef\u9636\u6bb5\uff08\u8054\u5408\u5229\u7528\u54cd\u5e94\u9891\u7387\u4e0e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u805a\u5408\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cReASC\u59cb\u7ec8\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387-\u6210\u672c\u6743\u8861\u6548\u679c\uff1b\u5728Gemma-3-4B-it\u4e0a\u5904\u7406GSM8K\u65f6\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u6807\u51c6\u81ea\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u6700\u591a70%\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u4e14\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002", "conclusion": "ReASC\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u54cd\u5e94\u7ea7\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u5145\u5206\u6027\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

The success of existing RL attempts in LLMs usually relies on high-quality samples of thousands or beyond. In this paper, we challenge fundamental assumptions about data requirements in RL for LLMs by demonstrating the remarkable effectiveness of one-shot learning. Specifically, we introduce polymath learning, a framework for designing one training sample that elicits multidisciplinary impact. We present three key findings: (1) A single, strategically selected math reasoning sample can produce significant performance improvements across multiple domains, including physics, chemistry, and biology with RL; (2) The math skills salient to reasoning suggest the characteristics of the optimal polymath sample; and (3) An engineered synthetic sample that integrates multidiscipline elements outperforms training with individual samples that naturally occur. Our approach achieves superior performance to training with larger datasets across various reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating that sample quality and design, rather than quantity, may be the key to unlock enhanced reasoning capabilities in language models.

Our theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that standard CoT in CVQA suffers from state entanglement, spurious transitions, and exploration inefficiency, with small models particularly vulnerable in resource-constrained settings.

However, CoT often becomes unnecessarily long, increasing computation cost without actual accuracy gains or sometimes even degrading performance, a phenomenon known as ``overthinking''. We propose a multi-stage efficient reasoning method that combines supervised fine-tuning -- via rejection sampling or reasoning trace reformatting -- with reinforcement learning using an adaptive length penalty. We introduce a lightweight reward function that penalizes tokens generated after the first correct answer but encouraging self-verification only when beneficial. We conduct a holistic evaluation across seven diverse reasoning tasks, analyzing the accuracy-response length trade-off. Our approach reduces response length by an average of 28\\% for 8B models and 40\\% for 32B models, while incurring only minor performance drops of 1.6 and 2.5 points, respectively. Despite its conceptual simplicity, it achieves a superior trade-off compared to more complex state-of-the-art efficient reasoning methods, scoring 76.6, in terms of the area under the Overthinking-Adjusted Accuracy curve ($\\text{AUC}_{\\text{OAA}}$) -- 5 points above the base model and 2.5 points above the second-best approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08\u5982\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\u6216\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u91cd\u683c\u5f0f\u5316\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u5e26\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u957f\u5ea6\u60e9\u7f5a\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\uff08CoT\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u751f\u6210\uff08\u5373'\u8fc7\u5ea6\u601d\u8003'\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u663e\u8457\u538b\u7f29\u54cd\u5e94\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4ec5\u5e26\u6765\u8f7b\u5fae\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "motivation": "\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\uff08CoT\uff09\u867d\u63d0\u5347LLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u5197\u4f59\u3001\u4f4e\u6548\u751a\u81f3\u6709\u5bb3\u7684\u957f\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff08'\u8fc7\u5ea6\u601d\u8003'\uff09\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u4e14\u672a\u5fc5\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837/\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u91cd\u683c\u5f0f\u5316\uff09\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff1a\u5bf9\u9996\u4e2a\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u540e\u7684\u751f\u6210token\u65bd\u52a0\u60e9\u7f5a\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u6709\u76ca\u65f6\u9f13\u52b1\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u957f\u5ea6\u60e9\u7f5a\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u57287\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c8B\u548c32B\u6a21\u578b\u54cd\u5e94\u957f\u5ea6\u5206\u522b\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c1128%\u548c40%\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ec5\u4e0b\u964d1.6\u548c2.5\u5206\uff1bAUC_OAA\u8fbe76.6\uff0c\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u9ad85\u5206\u3001\u6bd4\u6b21\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad82.5\u5206\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u6982\u5ff5\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u590d\u6742\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6-\u957f\u5ea6\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u8fc7\u5ea6\u601d\u8003\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Synthetic data can bridge this gap, but existing generators do not jointly achieve behavioral diversity and logical groundedness. Rule-driven simulators rely on hand-crafted workflows and shallow stochasticity, which miss the richness of human behavior. Learning-based generators such as GANs capture correlations yet often violate hard financial constraints and still require training on private data. We introduce PersonaLedger, a generation engine that uses a large language model conditioned on rich user personas to produce diverse transaction streams, coupled with an expert configurable programmatic engine that maintains correctness. The LLM and engine interact in a closed loop: after each event, the engine updates the user state, enforces financial rules, and returns a context aware \"nextprompt\" that guides the LLM toward feasible next actions. With this engine, we create a public dataset of 30 million transactions from 23,000 users and a benchmark suite with two tasks, illiquidity classification and identity theft segmentation. PersonaLedger offers a realistic, privacy preserving resource that supports rigorous evaluation of forecasting and anomaly detection models.

While intermediate fusion mitigates data volume compared to raw sharing, existing frameworks typically rely on spatial compression or static confidence maps, which inefficiently transmit spatially redundant features from non-critical background regions. To address this, we propose Risk-intent Selective detection (RiSe), an interaction-aware framework that shifts the paradigm from identifying visible regions to prioritizing risk-critical ones. Specifically, we introduce a Potential Field-Trajectory Correlation Model (PTCM) grounded in potential field theory to quantitatively assess kinematic risks. Complementing this, an Intention-Driven Area Prediction Module (IDAPM) leverages ego-motion priors to proactively predict and filter key Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) areas essential for decision-making. By integrating these components, RiSe implements a semantic-selective fusion scheme that transmits high-fidelity features only from high-interaction regions, effectively acting as a feature denoiser.

However, a persistent challenge lies in linking such internal features to the reliable control of complex, behavior-level semantic attributes in language generation. In this paper, we propose a Sparse Autoencoder-based framework for retrieving and steering semantically interpretable internal features associated with high-level linguistic behaviors. Our method employs a contrastive feature retrieval pipeline based on controlled semantic oppositions, combing statistical activation analysis and generation-based validation to distill monosemantic functional features from sparse activation spaces. Using the Big Five personality traits as a case study, we demonstrate that our method enables precise, bidirectional steering of model behavior while maintaining superior stability and performance compared to existing activation steering methods like Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA). We further identify an empirical effect, which we term Functional Faithfulness, whereby intervening on a specific internal feature induces coherent and predictable shifts across multiple linguistic dimensions aligned with the target semantic attribute. Our findings suggest that LLMs internalize deeply integrated representations of high-order concepts, and provide a novel, robust mechanistic path for the regulation of complex AI behaviors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u8c03\u63a7\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4e0e\u9ad8\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u884c\u4e3a\uff08\u5982\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\uff09\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5185\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u2018\u529f\u80fd\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u2019\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u867d\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u5185\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u5c06\u5176\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u5173\u8054\u5230\u590d\u6742\u3001\u884c\u4e3a\u7ea7\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5c5e\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u4e0a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7279\u5f81\u68c0\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u53d7\u63a7\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u7acb\u6784\u5efa\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5206\u6790 pipeline\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7edf\u8ba1\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4ece\u7a00\u758f\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u5355\u4e49\u6027\u529f\u80fd\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728Big Five\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u53cc\u5411\u884c\u4e3a\u8c03\u63a7\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8eCAA\u7b49\u73b0\u6709\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u2018\u529f\u80fd\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u2019\u73b0\u8c61\u2014\u2014\u5e72\u9884\u7279\u5b9a\u5185\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u5f15\u53d1\u591a\u4e2a\u8bed\u8a00\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u5185\u90e8\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6574\u5408\u7684\u9ad8\u9636\u6982\u5ff5\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u590d\u6742AI\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u673a\u5236\u5316\u8c03\u63a7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

In particular, decision-makers need to understand what causes generative AI systems to exhibit specific output characteristics. Within this general topic, this paper examines a key question: what is it about the input -- the prompt -- that causes an LLM-based generative AI system to produce output that exhibits specific characteristics, such as toxicity, negative sentiment, or political bias. To examine this question, we adapt a common technique from the Explainable AI literature: counterfactual explanations. We explain why traditional counterfactual explanations cannot be applied directly to generative AI systems, due to several differences in how generative AI systems function. We then propose a flexible framework that adapts counterfactual explanations to non-deterministic, generative AI systems in scenarios where downstream classifiers can reveal key characteristics of their outputs. Based on this framework, we introduce an algorithm for generating prompt-counterfactual explanations (PCEs). Finally, we demonstrate the production of counterfactual explanations for generative AI systems with three case studies, examining different output characteristics (viz., political leaning, toxicity, and sentiment). The case studies further show that PCEs can streamline prompt engineering to suppress undesirable output characteristics and can enhance red-teaming efforts to uncover additional prompts that elicit undesirable outputs. Ultimately, this work lays a foundation for prompt-focused interpretability in generative AI: a capability that will become indispensable as these models are entrusted with higher-stakes tasks and subject to emerging regulatory requirements for transparency and accountability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u7ea7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u2014\u2014\u63d0\u793a\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\uff08PCE\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9002\u914d\u4f20\u7edf\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5176\u5728\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6bd2\u6027\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u548c\u653f\u6cbb\u503e\u5411\u4e09\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e0e\u7ea2\u961f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u4e9f\u9700\u7406\u89e3\u8f93\u5165\u63d0\u793a\uff08prompt\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u8f93\u51fa\u7279\u6027\uff08\u5982\u6bd2\u6027\u3001\u504f\u89c1\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u7684LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u4e2d\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u601d\u60f3\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7075\u6d3b\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u9002\u914d\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u793a\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\uff08PCE\uff09\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8bc6\u522b\u8f93\u51fa\u5173\u952e\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u653f\u6cbb\u503e\u5411\u3001\u6bd2\u6027\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u4e09\u7c7b\u8f93\u51fa\u7279\u6027\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u751f\u6210PCE\uff1b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86PCE\u53ef\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u4ee5\u6291\u5236\u4e0d\u826f\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u7ea2\u961f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u80fd\u529b\u4ee5\u53d1\u73b0\u66f4\u591a\u8bf1\u53d1\u4e0d\u826f\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u9762\u5411\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u5e94\u7528\u4e0e\u76d1\u7ba1\u5408\u89c4\uff08\u5982\u900f\u660e\u6027\u3001\u95ee\u8d23\u5236\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6491\u3002"}}

We introduce RATS (Rapid Augmentations for Time Series), a high-performance library for time series augmentation written in Rust with Python bindings (RATSpy). RATS implements multiple augmentation methods spanning basic transformations, frequency-domain operations and time warping techniques, all accessible through a unified pipeline interface with built-in parallelisation. Comprehensive benchmarking of RATSpy versus a commonly used library (tasug) on 143 datasets demonstrates that RATSpy achieves an average speedup of 74.5\\% over tsaug (up to 94.8\\% on large datasets), with up to 47.9\\% less peak memory usage.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86RATS\uff08Rapid Augmentations for Time Series\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528Rust\u7f16\u5199\u3001\u652f\u6301Python\u7ed1\u5b9a\u7684\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u589e\u5f3a\u5e93\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709Python\u5e93\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u589e\u5f3a\u5e93\uff08\u4e3b\u8981\u4e3aPython\u5b9e\u73b0\uff09\u5728\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5448\u6307\u6570\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u751f\u4ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Rust\u5f00\u53d1RATS\u5e93\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9bPython\u7ed1\u5b9a\uff08RATSpy\uff09\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u57fa\u7840\u53d8\u6362\u3001\u9891\u57df\u64cd\u4f5c\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u626d\u66f2\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u7ba1\u9053\u63a5\u53e3\u548c\u5185\u7f6e\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5728143\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u660e\uff0cRATSpy\u76f8\u6bd4tsaug\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u901f74.5%\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u63d0\u901f\u8fbe94.8%\uff1b\u5cf0\u503c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u591a\u51cf\u5c1147.9%\u3002", "conclusion": "RATS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u589e\u5f3a\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u7684\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e14\u9700\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

SA-ResGS improves both the reliability of uncertainty estimates and their effectiveness for supervision by generating Self-Augmented point clouds (SA-Points) via triangulation between a training view and a rasterized extrapolated view, enabling efficient scene coverage estimation. While improving scene coverage through physically guided view selection, SA-ResGS also addresses the challenge of under-supervised Gaussians, exacerbated by sparse and wide-baseline views, by introducing the first residual learning strategy tailored for 3D Gaussian Splatting. This targeted supervision enhances gradient flow in high-uncertainty Gaussians by combining uncertainty-driven filtering with dropout- and hard-negative-mining-inspired sampling. Our contributions are threefold: (1) a physically grounded view selection strategy that promotes efficient and uniform scene coverage; (2) an uncertainty-aware residual supervision scheme that amplifies learning signals for weakly contributing Gaussians, improving training stability and uncertainty estimation across scenes with diverse camera distributions; (3) an implicit unbiasing of uncertainty quantification as a consequence of constrained view selection and residual supervision, which together mitigate conflicting effects of wide-baseline exploration and sparse-view ambiguity in NBV planning. Experiments on active view selection demonstrate that SA-ResGS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both reconstruction quality and view selection robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSelf-Augmented Residual 3D Gaussian Splatting\uff08SA-ResGS\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4e3b\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u4e0e\u4e0b\u4e00\u6b21\u6700\u4f73\u89c6\u89d2\uff08NBV\uff09\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u589e\u5f3a\u70b9\u4e91\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u76d1\u7763\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4e3b\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u56e0\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u5927\u57fa\u7ebf\u89c6\u89d2\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u76d1\u7763\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u53caNBV\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u51b2\u7a81\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSA-ResGS\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0e\u5916\u63a8\u6e32\u67d3\u89c6\u89d2\u4e09\u89d2\u5316\u751f\u6210Self-Augmented\u70b9\u4e91\uff08SA-Points\uff09\u4ee5\u4f30\u8ba1\u573a\u666f\u8986\u76d6\uff1b2\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u9996\u4e2a\u9762\u54113D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8fc7\u6ee4\u4e0e\u7c7bdropout/\u96be\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u6316\u6398\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u9ad8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9ad8\u65af\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e3b\u52a8\u89c6\u89d2\u9009\u62e9\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cSA-ResGS\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u89c6\u89d2\u9009\u62e9\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SA-ResGS\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u76d1\u7763\u53ca\u9690\u5f0f\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53bb\u504f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u5728\u4e3b\u52a8\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

This issue arises from architectural limits of transformers, where counting is performed across layers, leading to degraded precision for larger counting problems due to depth constraints. To address this limitation, we propose a simple test-time strategy inspired by System-2 cognitive processes that decomposes large counting tasks into smaller, independent sub-problems that the model can reliably solve. We evaluate this approach using observational and causal mediation analyses to understand the underlying mechanism of this System-2-like strategy. Our mechanistic analysis identifies key components: latent counts are computed and stored in the final item representations of each part, transferred to intermediate steps via dedicated attention heads, and aggregated in the final stage to produce the total count. Experimental results demonstrate that this strategy enables LLMs to surpass architectural limitations and achieve high accuracy on large-scale counting tasks.

While it enhances the generalization capabilities by suppressing high-frequency noise, it can be a limitation in scientific tasks that require capturing fine-scale structures. The delayed generalization phenomenon known as grokking is another barrier to rapid training of neural networks. Grokking has been hypothesized to arise as learning transitions from the NTK to the feature-rich regime. This paper explores the impact of preconditioned gradient descent (PGD), such as Gauss-Newton, on spectral bias and grokking phenomena. We demonstrate through theoretical and empirical results how PGD can mitigate issues associated with spectral bias. Additionally, building on the rich learning regime grokking hypothesis, we study how PGD can be used to reduce delays associated with grokking. Our conjecture is that PGD, without the impediment of spectral bias, enables uniform exploration of the parameter space in the NTK regime. Our experimental results confirm this prediction, providing strong evidence that grokking represents a transitional behavior between the lazy regime characterized by the NTK and the rich regime.

In these frameworks, a reverse generative process reconstructs physical fields from standard Gaussian noise conditioned on unseen geometries. The proposed approaches operate directly on point-cloud representations of computational domains (e.g., grid vertices of finite-volume meshes) and therefore avoid the limitations of pixelation used to project geometries onto uniform lattices. In contrast to graph neural network-based diffusion models, Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet do not exhibit high-frequency noise artifacts in the predicted fields. Moreover, unlike such approaches, which require auxiliary intermediate networks to condition geometry, the proposed frameworks rely solely on PointNet, resulting in a simple and unified architecture. The performance of the proposed frameworks is evaluated on steady incompressible flow past a cylinder, using a geometric dataset constructed by varying the cylinder's cross-sectional shape and orientation across samples. The results demonstrate that Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet achieve more accurate predictions of velocity and pressure fields, as well as lift and drag forces, and exhibit greater robustness to incomplete geometries compared to a vanilla PointNet with the same number of trainable parameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8ePointNet\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u51e0\u4f55\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff08Flow Matching PointNet\u548cDiffusion PointNet\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u51e0\u4f55\u4f53\u4e0a\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u6d41\u4f53\u6d41\u52a8\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u50cf\u7d20\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0a\u5efa\u6a21\u6d41\u573a\u65f6\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u50cf\u7d20\u5316\u6295\u5f71\u6216\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u4e14\u51e0\u4f55\u6761\u4ef6\u4f9d\u8d56\u590d\u6742\u8f85\u52a9\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u7b80\u6d01\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u672c\u5f81\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06PointNet\u5d4c\u5165\u6d41\u5339\u914d\uff08Flow Matching\uff09\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08Diffusion Models\uff09\u7684\u53cd\u5411\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u70b9\u4e91\u8868\u793a\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u57df\uff08\u5982\u6709\u9650\u4f53\u79ef\u7f51\u683c\u9876\u70b9\uff09\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u91cd\u5efa\u7269\u7406\u573a\uff1b\u65e0\u9700\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u6216\u989d\u5916\u51e0\u4f55\u7f16\u7801\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5706\u67f1\u7ed5\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u53d8\u5316\u622a\u9762\u5f62\u72b6\u4e0e\u671d\u5411\uff09\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u901f\u5ea6/\u538b\u529b\u573a\u53ca\u5347\u963b\u529b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u540c\u7b49\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u666e\u901aPointNet\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u51e0\u4f55\u66f4\u5177\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u56fe\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "PointNet\u4e0e\u6d41\u5339\u914d/\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u6d01\u3001\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u672c\u5f81\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6d41\u573a\u5efa\u6a21\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

We empirically show that under Top-5 retrieval with the gold document included, LLM answers vary substantially across permutations of the retrieved set, even when the gold document is fixed in the first position. This reveals a previously underexplored sensitivity to retrieval permutations. Although robust RAG methods primarily focus on enhancing LLM robustness to low-quality retrieval and mitigating positional bias to distribute attention fairly over long contexts, neither approach directly addresses permutation sensitivity. In this paper, we propose Stable-RAG, which exploits permutation sensitivity estimation to mitigate permutation-induced hallucinations. Stable-RAG runs the generator under multiple retrieval orders, clusters hidden states, and decodes from a cluster-center representation that captures the dominant reasoning pattern. It then uses these reasoning results to align hallucinated outputs toward the correct answer, encouraging the model to produce consistent and accurate predictions across document permutations. Experiments on three QA datasets show that Stable-RAG significantly improves answer accuracy, reasoning consistency and robust generalization across datasets, retrievers, and input lengths compared with baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faStable-RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f30\u8ba1\u68c0\u7d22\u6587\u6863\u987a\u5e8f\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u987a\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u3001\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u805a\u7c7b\u4e0e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8868\u793a\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3RAG\u4e2d\u56e0\u68c0\u7d22\u987a\u5e8f\u53d8\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u5173\u6ce8\u68c0\u7d22\u6587\u6863\u987a\u5e8f\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9LLM\u8f93\u51fa\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5373\u5373\u4f7f\u5305\u542b\u6b63\u786e\u6587\u6863\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u6392\u5217\u4ecd\u5bfc\u81f4\u7b54\u6848\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8be5\u2018\u6392\u5217\u654f\u611f\u6027\u2019\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "Stable-RAG\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u68c0\u7d22\u987a\u5e8f\u4e0b\u8fd0\u884c\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u5bf9\u5404\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u9009\u53d6\u7c07\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8868\u5f81\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u5bfc\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5bf9\u9f50\u5e76\u4fee\u6b63\u5e7b\u89c9\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u6392\u5217\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2aQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cStable-RAG\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u53ca\u8de8\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u3001\u8de8\u8f93\u5165\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u68c0\u7d22\u6587\u6863\u7684\u6392\u5217\u987a\u5e8f\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cdRAG\u6027\u80fd\uff1bStable-RAG\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u6392\u5217\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u589e\u5f3aRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

In practice, this requires trading off multiple, often competing, objectives through multi-objective optimization (MOO). However, existing MOO methods typically treat all hyperparameters as equally important, overlooking that hyperparameter importance (HPI) can vary significantly depending on the trade-off between objectives. We propose a novel dynamic optimization approach that prioritizes the most influential hyperparameters based on varying objective trade-offs during the search process, which accelerates empirical convergence and leads to better solutions. Building on prior work on HPI for MOO post-analysis, we now integrate HPI, calculated with HyperSHAP, into the optimization.

Existing approaches either suppress blur as noise and lose discriminative structure, or apply full image restoration that increases latency and limits deployment on resource constrained devices. We propose DFRCP, a Dynamic Fuzzy Robust Convolutional Pyramid, as a plug in upgrade to YOLOv11 for blur robust detection. DFRCP enhances the YOLOv11 feature pyramid by combining large scale and medium scale features while preserving native representations, and by introducing Dynamic Robust Switch units that adaptively inject fuzzy features to strengthen global perception under jitter. Fuzzy features are synthesized by rotating and nonlinearly interpolating multiscale features, then merged through a transparency convolution that learns a content adaptive trade off between original and fuzzy cues. We further develop a CUDA parallel rotation and interpolation kernel that avoids boundary overflow and delivers more than 400 times speedup, making the design practical for edge deployment. We train with paired supervision on a private wheat pest damage dataset of about 3,500 images, augmented threefold using two blur regimes, uniform image wide motion blur and bounding box confined rotational blur. On blurred test sets, YOLOv11 with DFRCP achieves about 10.4 percent higher accuracy than the YOLOv11 baseline with only a modest training time overhead, reducing the need for manual filtering after data collection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDFRCP\uff08\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u7cca\u9c81\u68d2\u5377\u79ef\u91d1\u5b57\u5854\uff09\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3aYOLOv11\u7684\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u9c81\u68d2\u5f00\u5173\u5355\u5143\u53ca\u6a21\u7cca\u7279\u5f81\u5408\u6210\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u7cca\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5c0f\u9ea6\u5bb3\u866b\u635f\u4f24\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u7cca\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fb9\u7f18\u5931\u771f\u548c\u9b3c\u5f71\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u635f\u5bb3\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u5c06\u6a21\u7cca\u89c6\u4e3a\u566a\u58f0\u800c\u4e22\u5931\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u56fe\u53bb\u6a21\u7cca\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u96be\u90e8\u7f72\u4e8e\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDFRCP\u6a21\u5757\uff1a1\uff09\u589e\u5f3aYOLOv11\u7279\u5f81\u91d1\u5b57\u5854\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u5927/\u4e2d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u539f\u751f\u8868\u5f81\uff1b2\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u52a8\u6001\u9c81\u68d2\u5f00\u5173\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6ce8\u5165\u7ecf\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u63d2\u503c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u5168\u5c40\u611f\u77e5\uff1b3\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u900f\u660e\u5377\u79ef\u878d\u5408\u539f\u59cb\u4e0e\u6a21\u7cca\u7ebf\u7d22\uff1b4\uff09\u5f00\u53d1CUDA\u5e76\u884c\u65cb\u8f6c\u63d2\u503c\u6838\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u8fb9\u754c\u6ea2\u51fa\u4e14\u63d0\u901f\u8d85400\u500d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u96c6\u6210DFRCP\u7684YOLOv11\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u7ea610.4%\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f00\u9500 modest\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u91c7\u96c6\u540e\u4eba\u5de5\u7b5b\u9009\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "DFRCP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u4e8e\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u9c81\u68d2\u68c0\u6d4b\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u4e0e\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u519c\u4e1a\u5bb3\u866b\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

However, recent work shows that LRMs often arrive at the correct answer before completing these textual reasoning steps, indicating the presence of latent reasoning -- internal, non-verbal computation encoded in hidden states. While this phenomenon has been explored in English, its multilingual behavior remains largely unknown. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation of multilingual latent reasoning in LRMs across 11 languages. Using a truncation-based strategy, we examine how the correct answer emerges as the model is given only partial reasoning traces, allowing us to measure stepwise latent prediction formation. Our results reveal clear evidence of multilingual latent reasoning, though unevenly: strong in resource-rich languages, weaker in low-resource ones, and broadly less observable on harder benchmarks. To understand whether these differences reflect distinct internal mechanisms, we further perform representational analyses. Despite surface-level disparities, we find that the internal evolution of predictions is highly consistent across languages and broadly aligns with English -- a pattern suggesting an English-centered latent reasoning pathway.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08LRMs\uff09\u572811\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u867d\u5b58\u5728\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u5dee\u5f02\uff08\u8d44\u6e90\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bed\u8a00\u66f4\u5f3a\u3001\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u8f83\u5f31\u3001\u96be\u9898\u4e0a\u66f4\u4e0d\u660e\u663e\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5185\u90e8\u9884\u6d4b\u6f14\u5316\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u4ee5\u82f1\u8bed\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u975e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a2\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u622a\u65ad\u7b56\u7565\u5206\u6790\u90e8\u5206\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0b\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u9010\u6b65\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8868\u5f81\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u8003\u5bdf\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u95f4\u5185\u90e8\u9884\u6d4b\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u5f02\u540c\u3002", "result": "\u572811\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u5747\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4f46\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5747\uff1a\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u5f3a\u3001\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u5f31\u3001\u96be\u9898\u4e0a\u66f4\u96be\u89c2\u6d4b\uff1b\u8868\u5f81\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u5404\u8bed\u8a00\u5185\u90e8\u9884\u6d4b\u6f14\u5316\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u82f1\u8bed\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u4f46\u53d7\u8bed\u8a00\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u5176\u5185\u5728\u673a\u5236\u5177\u6709\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5448\u73b0\u82f1\u8bed\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u3002"}}

We present a large-scale dataset of 129,000+ labeled multivariate time-series sequences from 153 rides by 51 participants under No, Low, and High Time Pressure conditions. Each sequence captures 63 features spanning vehicle kinematics, control inputs, behavioral violations, and environmental context. Our empirical analysis shows High Time Pressure induces 48% higher speeds, 36.4% greater speed variability, 58% more risky turns at intersections, 36% more sudden braking, and 50% higher rear brake forces versus No Time Pressure. To benchmark this dataset, we propose MotoTimePressure, a deep learning model combining convolutional preprocessing, dual-stage temporal attention, and Squeeze-and-Excitation feature recalibration, achieving 91.53% accuracy and 98.93% ROC AUC, outperforming eight baselines. Since time pressure cannot be directly measured in real time, we demonstrate its utility in collision prediction and threshold determination. Using MTPS-predicted time pressure as features, improves Informer-based collision risk accuracy from 91.25% to 93.51%, approaching oracle performance (93.72%).

While often attributed to data scale, we propose that this limitation arises from the intrinsic circuit complexity of the architecture. We formalize spatial understanding as learning a Group Homomorphism: mapping image sequences to a latent space that preserves the algebraic structure of the underlying transformation group. We demonstrate that for non-solvable groups (e.g., the 3D rotation group $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$), maintaining such a structure-preserving embedding is computationally lower-bounded by the Word Problem, which is $\\mathsf{NC^1}$-complete. In contrast, we prove that constant-depth ViTs with polynomial precision are strictly bounded by $\\mathsf{TC^0}$. Under the conjecture $\\mathsf{TC^0} \\subsetneq \\mathsf{NC^1}$, we establish a complexity boundary: constant-depth ViTs fundamentally lack the logical depth to efficiently capture non-solvable spatial structures. We validate this complexity gap via latent-space probing, demonstrating that ViT representations suffer a structural collapse on non-solvable tasks as compositional depth increases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51faViT\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u5fc3\u7406\u65cb\u8f6c\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u6e90\u4e8e\u5176\u5185\u5728\u7535\u8def\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u7fa4\u540c\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u975e\u53ef\u89e3\u7fa4\uff08\u5982SO(3)\uff09\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u6301\u5d4c\u5165\u5b58\u5728NC\u00b9-\u5b8c\u5168\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u800c\u5e38\u6570\u6df1\u5ea6ViT\u4ec5\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0TC\u2070\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e0a\u65e0\u6cd5\u80dc\u4efb\u6b64\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "Vision Transformers\uff08ViTs\uff09\u867d\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u5fc3\u7406\u65cb\u8f6c\uff09\u4e2d\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5931\u8d25\uff1b\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u6839\u6e90\u4e0d\u5728\u6570\u636e\u91cf\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u4e8eViT\u67b6\u6784\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u7535\u8def\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u56fe\u50cf\u5e8f\u5217\u5230\u9690\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7fa4\u540c\u6001\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u5e95\u5c42\u53d8\u6362\u7fa4\uff08\u5982SO(3)\uff09\u7684\u4ee3\u6570\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8be5\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0b\u754c\uff08Word Problem, NC\u00b9-\u5b8c\u5168\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eViT\u7684\u7535\u8def\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7c7b\uff08TC\u2070\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff1b\u8f85\u4ee5\u9690\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a2\u9488\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u5e38\u6570\u6df1\u5ea6ViT\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u88abTC\u2070\u4e25\u683c\u9650\u5236\uff1b\u5728NC\u00b9 \u2288 TC\u2070\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u786e\u7acb\u5176\u65e0\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u975e\u53ef\u89e3\u7fa4\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9eViT\u9690\u8868\u793a\u5728\u975e\u53ef\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u968f\u5c42\u6570\u589e\u52a0\u51fa\u73b0\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u574d\u584c\u3002", "conclusion": "ViT\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u7f3a\u9677\u662f\u5176\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u672c\u8d28\u9650\u5236\u6240\u81f4\uff0c\u9700\u8d85\u8d8aTC\u2070\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b0\u67b6\u6784\u6216\u673a\u5236\uff08\u5982\u66f4\u6df1\u7535\u8def\u3001\u663e\u5f0f\u7fa4\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff09\u6765\u7a81\u7834\u8be5\u8fb9\u754c\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we propose SentGraph, a sentence-level graph-based RAG framework that explicitly models fine-grained logical relationships between sentences for multi-hop question answering. Specifically, we construct a hierarchical sentence graph offline by first adapting Rhetorical Structure Theory to distinguish nucleus and satellite sentences, and then organizing them into topic-level subgraphs with cross-document entity bridges. During online retrieval, SentGraph performs graph-guided evidence selection and path expansion to retrieve fine-grained sentence-level evidence.

Although segmentation serves as the foundation for pixel-level understanding, existing approaches face two major challenges. First, they introduce implicit segmentation tokens and require simultaneous fine-tuning of both the MLLM and external pixel decoders, which increases the risk of catastrophic forgetting and limits generalization to out-of-domain scenarios. Second, most methods rely on single-pass reasoning and lack the capability to iteratively refine segmentation results, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel agentic MLLM, named IBISAgent, that reformulates segmentation as a vision-centric, multi-step decision-making process. IBISAgent enables MLLMs to generate interleaved reasoning and text-based click actions, invoke segmentation tools, and produce high-quality masks without architectural modifications. By iteratively performing multi-step visual reasoning on masked image features, IBISAgent naturally supports mask refinement and promotes the development of pixel-level visual reasoning capabilities. We further design a two-stage training framework consisting of cold-start supervised fine-tuning and agentic reinforcement learning with tailored, fine-grained rewards, enhancing the model's robustness in complex medical referring and reasoning segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IBISAgent consistently outperforms both closed-source and open-source SOTA methods.

To address this, we propose MMFormalizer, which extends autoformalization beyond text by integrating adaptive grounding with entities from real-world mathematical and physical domains. MMFormalizer recursively constructs formal propositions from perceptually grounded primitives through recursive grounding and axiom composition, with adaptive recursive termination ensuring that every abstraction is supported by visual evidence and anchored in dimensional or axiomatic grounding. We evaluate MMFormalizer on a new benchmark, PhyX-AF, comprising 115 curated samples from MathVerse, PhyX, Synthetic Geometry, and Analytic Geometry, covering diverse multimodal autoformalization tasks. Results show that frontier models such as GPT-5 and Gemini-3-Pro achieve the highest compile and semantic accuracy, with GPT-5 excelling in physical reasoning, while geometry remains the most challenging domain. Overall, MMFormalizer provides a scalable framework for unified multimodal autoformalization, bridging perception and formal reasoning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multimodal autoformalization method capable of handling classical mechanics (derived from the Hamiltonian), as well as relativity, quantum mechanics, and thermodynamics.

While the equivalence $p^{1/T} \\propto \\mathrm{softmax}(z/T)$ is well known, our contribution is an operator-level analytical framework built on this foundation rather than the equivalence itself.\n  The framework comprises four core components: (i) operator-agnostic bias--variance decompositions that characterize when sparse students outperform dense teachers, (ii) a homotopy path formalization of multi-stage pruning in function space explaining why iterative compression succeeds where one-shot pruning fails, (iii) convergence guarantees establishing $O(1/n)$ rates for $n$-stage distillation with explicit parameter dependence, and (iv) equivalence class characterizations identifying distinct probability-domain operators that yield identical student models under capacity constraints.\n  We introduce an axiomatic definition of probability-domain softening operators based on ranking preservation, continuity, entropy monotonicity, identity, and boundary behavior, and show that multiple non-equivalent operator families satisfy these axioms. All learning-theoretic guarantees are shown to hold uniformly across this operator class, independent of implementation details. These results provide theoretical grounding for black-box teacher distillation, partial-access settings such as top-$k$ truncation and text-only outputs, and privacy-preserving model compression.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u7387\u57df\u8f6f\u5316\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u504f\u5dee-\u65b9\u5dee\u5206\u89e3\u3001\u540c\u4f26\u8def\u5f84\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u3001\u6536\u655b\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u7b49\u4ef7\u7c7b\u523b\u753b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u8f6f\u5316\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u516c\u7406\u5316\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u7b97\u5b50\u65cf\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9ed1\u76d2\u84b8\u998f\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u8bbf\u95ee\u53ca\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u538b\u7f29\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u7a00\u758f\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u4f55\u7a00\u758f\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u5bc6\u96c6\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u4e3a\u4f55\u8fed\u4ee3\u526a\u679d\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u9ed1\u76d2\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u8bbf\u95ee\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u8bbe\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u7387\u57df\u8f6f\u5316\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u7b97\u5b50\u7ea7\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e94\u6761\u516c\u7406\u5b9a\u4e49\u8f6f\u5316\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u504f\u5dee-\u65b9\u5dee\u5206\u89e3\u3001\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u540c\u4f26\u8def\u5f84\u3001n\u9636\u6bb5\u84b8\u998f\u7684O(1/n)\u6536\u655b\u7387\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u5bb9\u91cf\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u76f8\u540c\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7b97\u5b50\u7b49\u4ef7\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u83b7\u5f97\u56db\u7c7b\u6838\u5fc3\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\uff1a\uff08i\uff09\u7b97\u5b50\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u504f\u5dee-\u65b9\u5dee\u5206\u89e3\uff1b\uff08ii\uff09\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u526a\u679d\u7684\u540c\u4f26\u8def\u5f84\u89e3\u91ca\uff1b\uff08iii\uff09\u663e\u5f0f\u53c2\u6570\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684O(1/n)\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff1b\uff08iv\uff09\u6ee1\u8db3\u76f8\u540c\u5b66\u751f\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u8f6f\u5316\u7b97\u5b50\u7b49\u4ef7\u7c7b\u523b\u753b\uff1b\u6240\u6709\u7ed3\u8bba\u5728\u6240\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u516c\u7406\u5316\u7b97\u5b50\u7c7b\u4e0a\u4e00\u81f4\u6210\u7acb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u7a00\u758f\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u3001\u7b97\u5b50\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u81f3\u9ed1\u76d2\u84b8\u998f\u3001top-k\u622a\u65ad\u3001\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u51fa\u53ca\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u538b\u7f29\u7b49\u73b0\u5b9e\u7ea6\u675f\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Under domain shifts, the model becomes overly sensitive to fine-grained cues, leading to the suppression of critical features and a significant drop in performance. Cognitive studies suggest that humans classify objects by leveraging both common and specific attributes, enabling accurate differentiation between fine-grained categories. However, current deep learning models have yet to incorporate this mechanism effectively. Inspired by this mechanism, we propose Concept-Feature Structuralized Generalization (CFSG). This model explicitly disentangles both the concept and feature spaces into three structured components: common, specific, and confounding segments. To mitigate the adverse effects of varying degrees of distribution shift, we introduce an adaptive mechanism that dynamically adjusts the proportions of common, specific, and confounding components. In the final prediction, explicit weights are assigned to each pair of components. Extensive experiments on three single-source benchmark datasets demonstrate that CFSG achieves an average performance improvement of 9.87% over baseline models and outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by an average of 3.08%. Additionally, explainability analysis validates that CFSG effectively integrates multi-granularity structured knowledge and confirms that feature structuralization facilitates the emergence of concept structuralization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faConcept-Feature Structuralized Generalization (CFSG)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89e3\u8026\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e3a\u5171\u6027\u3001\u7279\u6027\u548c\u6df7\u6dc6\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5404\u90e8\u5206\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\uff08FGDG\uff09\u56e0\u7c7b\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u7ec6\u5fae\u3001\u7c7b\u5185\u53d8\u5316\u663e\u8457\u800c\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u672a\u6709\u6548\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u5229\u7528\u5171\u6027\u4e0e\u7279\u6027\u5c5e\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCFSG\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u5730\u5c06\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u5171\u6027\u3001\u7279\u6027\u548c\u6df7\u6dc6\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u4e09\u8005\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u5bf9\u5404\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5bf9\u8d4b\u4e88\u663e\u5f0f\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5355\u6e90\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cCFSG\u5e73\u5747\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53479.87%\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u57473.08%\uff1b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5176\u80fd\u878d\u5408\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4e14\u7279\u5f81\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6982\u5ff5\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "CFSG\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u4eff\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89e3\u8026\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\u5728FGDG\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Standard supervised training lacks explicit annotations for symptom evolution, while direct Reinforcement Learning (RL) is hindered by sparse binary rewards. To address this challenge, we introduce Dementia-R1, an RL-based framework for longitudinal dementia prognosis from unstructured clinical notes. Our approach adopts a Cold-Start RL strategy that pre-trains the model to predict verifiable clinical indices extracted from patient histories, enhancing the capability to reason about disease progression before determining the final clinical status. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Dementia-R1 achieves an F1 score of 77.03% on real-world unstructured clinical datasets.

Nevertheless, existing benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs' instruction-following capability primarily focus on verbal instructions in the textual modality. These limitations hinder a thorough analysis of instruction-following capabilities, as they overlook the implicit constraints embedded in the semantically rich visual modality. To address this gap, we introduce VC-IFEval, a new benchmark accompanied by a systematically constructed dataset that evaluates MLLMs' instruction-following ability under multimodal settings.

Our framework employs a multi-agent system to synthesize realistic patient records and chief complaints from underlying disease knowledge without accessing real-world electronic health records, thereby mitigating privacy and data-governance concerns. We design a robust Patient Agent that is limited to a set of atomic medical facts and augmented with a dynamic guidance mechanism that continuously detects and corrects hallucinations throughout the dialogue, ensuring internal coherence and clinical plausibility of the simulated cases. Furthermore, we propose a structured LLM-based and expert-annotated rubric-generation pipeline that retrieves Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) guidelines and utilizes the reject sampling to derive a prioritized set of rubric items (\"must-ask\" items) for each case.

We address the scarcity of long-context QA resources for Indic languages by introducing LittiChoQA, the largest literary QA dataset to date covering many languages spoken in the Gangetic plains of India. The dataset comprises over 270K automatically generated question-answer pairs with a balanced distribution of factoid and non-factoid questions, generated from naturally authored literary texts collected from the open web. We evaluate multiple multilingual LLMs on non-factoid, abstractive QA, under both full-context and context-shortened settings. Results demonstrate a clear trade-off between performance and efficiency: full-context fine-tuning yields the highest token-level and semantic-level scores, while context shortening substantially improves throughput. Among the evaluated models, Krutrim-2 achieves the strongest performance, obtaining a semantic score of 76.1 with full context. While, in shortened context settings it scores 74.9 with answer paragraph selection and 71.4 with vector-based retrieval.

Prior diffusion unlearning methods typically rely on supervised weight edits or global penalties; reinforcement-learning (RL) approaches, while flexible, often optimize sparse end-of-trajectory rewards, yielding high-variance updates and weak credit assignment. We present a general RL framework for diffusion unlearning that treats denoising as a sequential decision process and introduces a timestep-aware critic with noisy-step rewards. Concretely, we train a CLIP-based reward predictor on noisy latents and use its per-step signal to compute advantage estimates for policy-gradient updates of the reverse diffusion kernel. Our algorithm is simple to implement, supports off-policy reuse, and plugs into standard text-to-image backbones. Across multiple concepts, the method achieves better or comparable forgetting to strong baselines while maintaining image quality and benign prompt fidelity; ablations show that (i) per-step critics and (ii) noisy-conditioned rewards are key to stability and effectiveness.

MLLMs still suffer from visually ungrounded hallucinations, often relying on language priors rather than image evidence. While many prior mitigation strategies operate on the text side, they leave the visual representation unchanged and do not exploit the rich hierarchy of features encoded across vision layers. Existing multi-layer fusion methods partially address this limitation but remain static, applying the same layer mixture regardless of the query. In this work, we introduce TGIF (Text-Guided Inter-layer Fusion), a lightweight module that treats encoder layers as depth-wise \"experts\" and predicts a prompt-dependent fusion of visual features. TGIF follows the principle of direct external fusion, requires no vision-encoder updates, and adds minimal overhead. Integrated into LLaVA-1.5-7B, TGIF provides consistent improvements across hallucination, OCR, and VQA benchmarks, while preserving or improving performance on ScienceQA, GQA, and MMBench.

We introduce F-DPO (Factuality-aware Direct Preference Optimization), a simple extension of DPO that uses only binary factuality labels. F-DPO (i) applies a label-flipping transformation that corrects misordered preference pairs so the chosen response is never less factual than the rejected one, and (ii) adds a factuality-aware margin that emphasizes pairs with clear correctness differences, while reducing to standard DPO when both responses share the same factuality. We construct factuality-aware preference data by augmenting DPO pairs with binary factuality indicators and synthetic hallucinated variants. Across seven open-weight LLMs (1B-14B), F-DPO consistently improves factuality and reduces hallucination rates relative to both base models and standard DPO. On Qwen3-8B, F-DPO reduces hallucination rates by five times (from 0.424 to 0.084) while improving factuality scores by 50 percent (from 5.26 to 7.90). F-DPO also generalizes to out-of-distribution benchmarks: on TruthfulQA, Qwen2.5-14B achieves plus 17 percent MC1 accuracy (0.500 to 0.585) and plus 49 percent MC2 accuracy (0.357 to 0.531).

Can new and useful information be constructed from merely applying deterministic transformations to existing data? Can the learnable content in data be evaluated without considering a downstream task? On these questions, Shannon information and Kolmogorov complexity come up nearly empty-handed, in part because they assume observers with unlimited computational capacity and fail to target the useful information content. In this work, we identify and exemplify three seeming paradoxes in information theory: (1) information cannot be increased by deterministic transformations; (2) information is independent of the order of data; (3) likelihood modeling is merely distribution matching. To shed light on the tension between these results and modern practice, and to quantify the value of data, we introduce epiplexity, a formalization of information capturing what computationally bounded observers can learn from data. Epiplexity captures the structural content in data while excluding time-bounded entropy, the random unpredictable content exemplified by pseudorandom number generators and chaotic dynamical systems. With these concepts, we demonstrate how information can be created with computation, how it depends on the ordering of the data, and how likelihood modeling can produce more complex programs than present in the data generating process itself. We also present practical procedures to estimate epiplexity which we show capture differences across data sources, track with downstream performance, and highlight dataset interventions that improve out-of-distribution generalization. In contrast to principles of model selection, epiplexity provides a theoretical foundation for data selection, guiding how to select, generate, or transform data for learning systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa'epiplexity'\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u7528\u4ee5\u91cf\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u53d7\u9650\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u80fd\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u65e0\u6cd5\u523b\u753b\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9999\u519c\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u548c\u67ef\u5c14\u83ab\u54e5\u6d1b\u592b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u56e0\u5047\u8bbe\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u5177\u6709\u65e0\u9650\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u523b\u753b\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6709\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u542b\u91cf\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\u73b0\u4ee3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u53d8\u6362\u3001\u987a\u5e8f\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u4f3c\u7136\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faepiplexity\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65b0\u4fe1\u606f\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u53d7\u9650\u71b5\uff08\u5982\u4f2a\u968f\u673a\u6570\u3001\u6df7\u6c8c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u968f\u673a\u6027\uff09\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u4f30\u8ba1epiplexity\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4fe1\u606f\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u88ab\u2018\u521b\u9020\u2019\uff1b\u4fe1\u606f\u4f9d\u8d56\u6570\u636e\u987a\u5e8f\uff1b\u4f3c\u7136\u5efa\u6a21\u53ef\u751f\u6210\u6bd4\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff1bepiplexity\u4f30\u8ba1\u503c\u80fd\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u3001\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5173\u3001\u63ed\u793a\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "epiplexity\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u53d8\u6362\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u539f\u5219\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5c42\u9762\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u7f3a\u5931\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4ee5\u6570\u636e\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684AI\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

For harvests to flourish and agricultural productivity to boost, grape leaf disease detection is important. The plant disease dataset contains grape leaf diseases total of 9,032 images of four classes, among them three classes are leaf diseases, and the other one is healthy leaves. After rigorous pre-processing dataset was split (70% training, 20% validation, 10% testing), and two pre-trained models were deployed: InceptionV3 and Xception.

Recently, unsupervised learning of data group structure with deep learning methods has gained popularity. TURTLE, a state of the art deep clustering algorithm, uncovers data labeling without supervision by alternating label and hyperplane updates, maximizing the hyperplane margin, in a similar fashion to support vector machines (SVMs). However, TURTLE assumes clusters are balanced; when data is imbalanced, it yields non-ideal hyperplanes that cause higher clustering error. We propose PET-TURTLE, which generalizes the cost function to handle imbalanced data distributions by a power law prior. Additionally, by introducing sparse logits in the labeling process, PET-TURTLE optimizes a simpler search space that in turn improves accuracy for balanced datasets. Experiments on synthetic and real data show that PET-TURTLE improves accuracy for imbalanced sources, prevents over-prediction of minority clusters, and enhances overall clustering.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PET-TURTLE\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5e42\u5f8b\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u7a00\u758flogits\u6765\u89e3\u51b3TURTLE\u5728\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u805a\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "TURTLE\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6df1\u5ea6\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u65f6\u56e0\u5047\u8bbe\u7c07\u5e73\u8861\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u6b21\u4f18\u8d85\u5e73\u9762\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u805a\u7c7b\u8bef\u5dee\u5347\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "PET-TURTLE\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4ee3\u4ef7\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u5e42\u5f8b\u5148\u9a8c\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u914d\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u91c7\u7528\u7a00\u758flogits\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPET-TURTLE\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u4e86\u5bf9\u5c11\u6570\u7c07\u7684\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u6574\u4f53\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u805a\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "PET-TURTLE\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86TURTLE\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u5e73\u8861\u6027\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Meanwhile, closed-source systems (e.g., Nano Banana) have demonstrated strong reasoning-driven image generation, highlighting a substantial gap to current open-source models. We argue that closing this gap requires not merely better visual generators, but executable reasoning: decomposing high-level intents into grounded, verifiable plans that directly steer the generative process. To this end, we propose Unified Thinker, a task-agnostic reasoning architecture for general image generation, designed as a unified planning core that can plug into diverse generators and workflows. Unified Thinker decouples a dedicated Thinker from the image Generator, enabling modular upgrades of reasoning without retraining the entire generative model. We further introduce a two-stage training paradigm: we first build a structured planning interface for the Thinker, then apply reinforcement learning to ground its policy in pixel-level feedback, encouraging plans that optimize visual correctness over textual plausibility. Extensive experiments on text-to-image generation and image editing show that Unified Thinker substantially improves image reasoning and generation quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faUnified Thinker\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\uff08Thinker\uff09\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\uff08Generator\uff09\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5f00\u6e90\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u63a8\u7406-\u6267\u884c\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff1b\u800c\u95ed\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982Nano Banana\uff09\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUnified Thinker\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u89e3\u8026\u4e13\u7528Thinker\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cfGenerator\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89c4\u5212\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u5408\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u53cd\u9988\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f7f\u89c4\u5212\u7b56\u7565\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u6587\u672c\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cUnified Thinker\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u95ed\u5408\u63a8\u7406-\u6267\u884c\u9e3f\u6c9f\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5728\u4e8e\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u2014\u2014\u5373\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u53ef\u843d\u5730\u7684\u89c4\u5212\uff1bUnified Thinker\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u89c4\u5212\u6838\u5fc3\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u5347\u7ea7\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u653e\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

In contrast, we observe that their corresponding base LLMs often remain well-calibrated. This naturally motivates us to calibrate PoLLM confidence using the base LLM as a reference. This work proposes two ways to achieve this. A straightforward solution, BaseCal-ReEval, evaluates PoLLM's responses by feeding them into the base LLM to get average probabilities as confidence. While effective, this approach introduces additional inference overhead. To address this, we propose BaseCal-Proj, which trains a lightweight projection to map the final-layer hidden states of PoLLMs back to those of their base LLMs. These projected states are then processed by the base LLM's output layer to derive base-calibrated confidence for PoLLM's responses. Notably, BaseCal is an unsupervised, plug-and-play solution that operates without human labels or LLM modifications.

In this paper, we show, both empirically and theoretically, that sparse attention can paradoxically increase end-to-end complexity: information loss often induces significantly longer sequences, a phenomenon we term ``Less is Less'' (Lil). To mitigate the Lil problem, we propose an early-stopping algorithm that detects the threshold where information loss exceeds information gain during sparse decoding.

By representing the entire conversation as a temporal graph, we present a novel graph-based method for detecting dialogue-level hallucinations. Our framework models each dialogue as a node, encoding it using a sentence transformer. We explore two different ways of connectivity: i) shared-entity edges, which connect turns that refer to the same entities; ii) temporal edges, which connect contiguous turns in the conversation. Message-passing is used to update the node embeddings, allowing flow of information between related nodes. The context-aware node embeddings are then combined using attention pooling into a single vector, which is then passed on to a classifier to determine the presence and type of hallucinations. We demonstrate that our method offers slightly improved performance over existing methods. Further, we show the attention mechanism can be used to justify the decision making process.

Although existing grounding techniques improve overall performance, they often fail to establish a true anatomical correspondence, resulting in incorrect anatomical understanding in the medical domain. To address this gap, we introduce AnatomiX, a multitask multimodal large language model explicitly designed for anatomically grounded chest X-ray interpretation. Inspired by the radiological workflow, AnatomiX adopts a two stage approach: first, it identifies anatomical structures and extracts their features, and then leverages a large language model to perform diverse downstream tasks such as phrase grounding, report generation, visual question answering, and image understanding. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that AnatomiX achieves superior anatomical reasoning and delivers over 25% improvement in performance on anatomy grounding, phrase grounding, grounded diagnosis and grounded captioning tasks compared to existing approaches.

It can effectively reduce factuality hallucinations, but faithfulness hallucinations still exist. Previous methods for detecting faithfulness hallucinations either neglect to capture the models' internal reasoning processes or handle those features coarsely, making it difficult for discriminators to learn. This paper proposes a semantic-level internal reasoning graph-based method for detecting faithfulness hallucination. Specifically, we first extend the layer-wise relevance propagation algorithm from the token level to the semantic level, constructing an internal reasoning graph based on attribution vectors. This provides a more faithful semantic-level representation of dependency. Furthermore, we design a general framework based on a small pre-trained language model to utilize the dependencies in LLM's reasoning for training and hallucination detection, which can dynamically adjust the pass rate of correct samples through a threshold.

We formalize this discrepancy as Conduction Aphasia, a phenomenon where models accurately interpret multimodal inputs but struggle to translate that understanding into faithful and controllable synthesis. To address this, we propose UniCorn, a simple yet elegant self-improvement framework that eliminates the need for external data or teacher supervision. By partitioning a single UMM into three collaborative roles: Proposer, Solver, and Judge, UniCorn generates high-quality interactions via self-play and employs cognitive pattern reconstruction to distill latent understanding into explicit generative signals. To validate the restoration of multimodal coherence, we introduce UniCycle, a cycle-consistency benchmark based on a Text to Image to Text reconstruction loop. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniCorn achieves comprehensive and substantial improvements over the base model across six general image generation benchmarks. Notably, it achieves SOTA performance on TIIF(73.8), DPG(86.8), CompBench(88.5), and UniCycle while further delivering substantial gains of +5.0 on WISE and +6.5 on OneIG. These results highlight that our method significantly enhances T2I generation while maintaining robust comprehension, demonstrating the scalability of fully self-supervised refinement for unified multimodal intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faUniCorn\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u63d0\u5347\u65b9\u5f0f\u89e3\u51b3\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u5f3a\u4f46\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u5f31\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u79f0\u4e3a\u4f20\u5bfc\u6027\u5931\u8bed\u75c7\uff09\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u6216\u6559\u5e08\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u3002", "motivation": "\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff08UMMs\uff09\u867d\u5728\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5c06\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u77ed\u677f\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5c06\u6b64\u73b0\u8c61\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a'\u4f20\u5bfc\u6027\u5931\u8bed\u75c7'\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUniCorn\u81ea\u6539\u8fdb\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5c06\u5355\u4e2aUMM\u5212\u5206\u4e3aProposer\u3001Solver\u548cJudge\u4e09\u4e2a\u534f\u4f5c\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u535a\u5f08\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u8ba4\u77e5\u6a21\u5f0f\u91cd\u6784\u5c06\u9690\u542b\u7406\u89e3\u84b8\u998f\u4e3a\u663e\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u6784\u5efaUniCycle\u5faa\u73af\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\uff08Text\u2192Image\u2192Text\uff09\u9a8c\u8bc1\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6062\u590d\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5168\u9762\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728TIIF(73.8)\u3001DPG(86.8)\u3001CompBench(88.5)\u548cUniCycle\u4e0a\u8fbeSOTA\uff0c\u5e76\u5728WISE(+5.0)\u4e0eOneIG(+6.5)\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u5927\u5e45\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "UniCorn\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u4f18\u5316\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u7406\u89e3\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u81ea\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Prior work on compact reasoning shortens such chains through probabilistic sampling, heuristics, or supervision from frontier models, but offers limited insight into whether models internally encode token-level functional importance for answer generation. We address this gap diagnostically and propose greedy pruning, a likelihood-preserving deletion procedure that iteratively removes reasoning tokens whose removal minimally degrades model likelihood under a specified objective, yielding length-controlled reasoning chains. We evaluate pruned reasoning in a distillation framework and show that students trained on pruned chains outperform a frontier-model-supervised compression baseline at matched reasoning lengths. Finally, our analysis reveals systematic pruning patterns and shows that attention scores can predict greedy pruning ranks, further suggesting that models encode a nontrivial functional importance structure over reasoning tokens.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u8d2a\u5a6a\u526a\u679d\uff08greedy pruning\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u4f3c\u7136\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u5220\u9664\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u4e2d\u529f\u80fd\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684token\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u751f\u6210\u957f\u5ea6\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u526a\u679d\u540e\u94fe\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u4e8e\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u5b58\u5728token\u7ea7\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7d27\u51d1\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u6982\u7387\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u6216\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u76d1\u7763\uff09\u672a\u80fd\u63ed\u793a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u7f16\u7801\u4e86token\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8d2a\u5a6a\u526a\u679d\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u4f3c\u7136\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u5220\u9664\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6bcf\u6b21\u79fb\u9664\u5bf9\u6307\u5b9a\u76ee\u6807\u4e0b\u6a21\u578b\u4f3c\u7136\u4e0b\u964d\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u63a8\u7406token\uff1b\u5e76\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u526a\u679d\u94fe\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5206\u6790\u526a\u679d\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ca\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6570\u4e0e\u526a\u679d\u987a\u5e8f\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5339\u914d\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d2a\u5a6a\u526a\u679d\u94fe\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6570\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u526a\u679d\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u9690\u542b\u7f16\u7801\u4e86token\u529f\u80fd\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u786e\u5b9e\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u9690\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u4e86token\u7ea7\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u8d2a\u5a6a\u526a\u679d\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u538b\u7f29\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

LTX-2 consists of an asymmetric dual-stream transformer with a 14B-parameter video stream and a 5B-parameter audio stream, coupled through bidirectional audio-video cross-attention layers with temporal positional embeddings and cross-modality AdaLN for shared timestep conditioning. This architecture enables efficient training and inference of a unified audiovisual model while allocating more capacity for video generation than audio generation. We employ a multilingual text encoder for broader prompt understanding and introduce a modality-aware classifier-free guidance (modality-CFG) mechanism for improved audiovisual alignment and controllability. Beyond generating speech, LTX-2 produces rich, coherent audio tracks that follow the characters, environment, style, and emotion of each scene -- complete with natural background and foley elements.

Although many approaches seek to align large language models (LLMs) with human moral values, how to enable them morally sensitive has been extremely challenging. In this paper, we take a step toward answering the question: how can we enhance moral sensitivity in LLMs? Specifically, we propose two pragmatic inference methods that faciliate LLMs to diagnose morally benign and hazardous input and correct moral errors, whereby enhancing LLMs' moral sensitivity. A central strength of our pragmatic inference methods is their unified perspective: instead of modeling moral discourses across semantically diverse and complex surface forms, they offer a principled perspective for designing pragmatic inference procedures grounded in their inferential loads. Empirical evidence demonstrates that our pragmatic methods can enhance moral sensitivity in LLMs and achieves strong performance on representative morality-relevant benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u9053\u5fb7\u65e0\u5bb3\u4e0e\u6709\u5bb3\u8f93\u5165\u5e76\u7ea0\u6b63\u9053\u5fb7\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8d1f\u8377\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u9053\u5fb7\u76f8\u5173\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5df2\u6709\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c1d\u8bd5\u4f7f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u4eba\u7c7b\u9053\u5fb7\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\uff0c\u4f46\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u9053\u5fb7\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4ecd\u6781\u5177\u6311\u6218\uff1b\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u5bf9\u9053\u5fb7\u60c5\u5883\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u54cd\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u8d1f\u8377\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7fLLM\u80fd\u591f\u8bca\u65ad\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u826f\u6027/\u6709\u5bb3\uff09\u5e76\u4e3b\u52a8\u7ea0\u6b63\u9053\u5fb7\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8bbe\u8ba1\u800c\u975e\u5904\u7406\u8bed\u4e49\u7e41\u6742\u7684\u8868\u5c42\u9053\u5fb7\u8bdd\u8bed\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u9053\u5fb7\u76f8\u5173\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u8d1f\u8377\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5177\u9053\u5fb7\u610f\u8bc6\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, due to the limitations of current AIGC models, most models can only serve as individual components within specific application scenarios and are not capable of completing tasks end-to-end in real-world applications. In real-world applications, editing experts often work with a wide variety of images and video inputs, producing multimodal outputs -- a video typically includes audio, text, and other elements. This level of integration across multiple modalities is something current models are unable to achieve effectively. However, the rise of agent-based systems has made it possible to use AI tools to tackle complex content generation tasks. To deal with the complex scenarios, in this paper, we propose a MultiMedia-Agent designed to automate complex content creation. Our agent system includes a data generation pipeline, a tool library for content creation, and a set of metrics for evaluating preference alignment. Notably, we introduce the skill acquisition theory to model the training data curation and agent training. We designed a two-stage correlation strategy for plan optimization, including self-correlation and model preference correlation. Additionally, we utilized the generated plans to train the MultiMedia-Agent via a three stage approach including base/success plan finetune and preference optimization. The comparison results demonstrate that the our approaches are effective and the MultiMedia-Agent can generate better multimedia content compared to novel models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMultiMedia-Agent\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6280\u80fd\u83b7\u53d6\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86AIGC\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u591a\u5a92\u4f53\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709AIGC\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u4e3a\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u9700\u878d\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u89c6\u9891\u3001\u97f3\u9891\u3001\u6587\u672c\u7b49\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u4e0e\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u590d\u6742\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b\u800c\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMultiMedia-Agent\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\u3001\u5185\u5bb9\u521b\u4f5c\u5de5\u5177\u5e93\u548c\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u6280\u80fd\u83b7\u53d6\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u4ee3\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u76f8\u5173\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u597d\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8ba1\u5212\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u8ba1\u5212\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u6210\u529f\u8ba1\u5212\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0cMultiMedia-Agent\u5728\u591a\u5a92\u4f53\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u65b0\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "MultiMedia-Agent\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u9ad8\u96c6\u6210\u5ea6\u7684AIGC\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8AIGC\u4ece\u5355\u4e00\u5de5\u5177\u5411\u534f\u540c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6f14\u8fdb\u3002"}}

Input attribution methods aim to highlight each input token's contributions to the model's output, but existing approaches are typically model-agnostic, and do not focus on transformer-specific architectures, leading to limited faithfulness. To address this, we propose Grad-ELLM, a gradient-based attribution method for decoder-only transformer-based LLMs. By aggregating channel importance from gradients of the output logit with respect to attention layers and spatial importance from attention maps, Grad-ELLM generates heatmaps at each generation step without requiring architectural modifications. Additionally, we introduce two faithfulneses metrics $\u03c0$-Soft-NC and $\u03c0$-Soft-NS, which are modifications of Soft-NC/NS that provide fairer comparisons by controlling the amount of information kept when perturbing the text. We evaluate Grad-ELLM on sentiment classification, question answering, and open-generation tasks using different models.

Such representations restrict their scalability to arbitrary output resolutions and hinder the geometric detail recovery. This paper introduces InfiniDepth, which represents depth as neural implicit fields. Through a simple yet effective local implicit decoder, we can query depth at continuous 2D coordinates, enabling arbitrary-resolution and fine-grained depth estimation. To better assess our method's capabilities, we curate a high-quality 4K synthetic benchmark from five different games, spanning diverse scenes with rich geometric and appearance details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InfiniDepth achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks across relative and metric depth estimation tasks, particularly excelling in fine-detail regions. It also benefits the task of novel view synthesis under large viewpoint shifts, producing high-quality results with fewer holes and artifacts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faInfiniDepth\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u9690\u5f0f\u573a\u8868\u793a\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4efb\u610f\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u56fe\u50cf\u7f51\u683c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4efb\u610f\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e14\u5f71\u54cd\u51e0\u4f55\u7ec6\u8282\u6062\u590d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faInfiniDepth\uff0c\u5c06\u6df1\u5ea6\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u9690\u5f0f\u573a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u9690\u5f0f\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u8fde\u7eed2D\u5750\u6807\u4e0a\u67e5\u8be2\u6df1\u5ea6\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u81ea\u5efa\u76844K\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u53ca\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u533a\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u89c6\u89d2\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u7a7a\u6d1e\u4e0e\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002", "conclusion": "\u795e\u7ecf\u9690\u5f0f\u6df1\u5ea6\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7a81\u7834\u4f20\u7edf\u79bb\u6563\u7f51\u683c\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3001\u9ad8\u7ec6\u8282\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

We elicit preference judgments from LLMs by prompting them to select the funnier response and found that user clusters exhibit distinct preference patterns and that the LLM results can resemble those of particular clusters.

Previous methods, which rely on part-aware optimization, manual assembly, or 2D image generation, often produce unrealistic or incoherent 3D assets due to the challenges of intricate part-level manipulation and limited out-of-domain generation. In contrast, Muses leverages the 3D skeleton, a fundamental representation of biological forms, to explicitly and rationally compose diverse elements. This skeletal foundation formalizes 3D content creation as a structure-aware pipeline of design, composition, and generation. Muses begins by constructing a creatively composed 3D skeleton with coherent layout and scale through graph-constrained reasoning. This skeleton then guides a voxel-based assembly process within a structured latent space, integrating regions from different objects. Finally, image-guided appearance modeling under skeletal conditions is applied to generate a style-consistent and harmonious texture for the assembled shape. Extensive experiments establish Muses' state-of-the-art performance in terms of visual fidelity and alignment with textual descriptions, and potential on flexible 3D object editing.

We present the first neuron-level interpretability study of emotion-sensitive neurons (ESNs) in LALMs and provide causal evidence that such units exist in Qwen2.5-Omni, Kimi-Audio, and Audio Flamingo 3. Across these three widely used open-source models, we compare frequency-, entropy-, magnitude-, and contrast-based neuron selectors on multiple emotion recognition benchmarks. Using inference-time interventions, we reveal a consistent emotion-specific signature: ablating neurons selected for a given emotion disproportionately degrades recognition of that emotion while largely preserving other classes, whereas gain-based amplification steers predictions toward the target emotion.

We propose ToxiGAN, a class-aware text augmentation framework that combines adversarial generation with semantic guidance from large language models (LLMs). To address common issues in GAN-based augmentation such as mode collapse and semantic drift, ToxiGAN introduces a two-step directional training strategy and leverages LLM-generated neutral texts as semantic ballast. Unlike prior work that treats LLMs as static generators, our approach dynamically selects neutral exemplars to provide balanced guidance. Toxic samples are explicitly optimized to diverge from these exemplars, reinforcing class-specific contrastive signals. Experiments on four hate speech benchmarks show that ToxiGAN achieves the strongest average performance in both macro-F1 and hate-F1, consistently outperforming traditional and LLM-based augmentation methods. Ablation and sensitivity analyses further confirm the benefits of semantic ballast and directional training in enhancing classifier robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faToxiGAN\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u6297\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u8bed\u4e49\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u611f\u77e5\u6587\u672c\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u6bd2\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u6b65\u5b9a\u5411\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u4e2d\u6027\u6837\u672c\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u6a21\u5f0f\u574d\u7f29\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u6bd2\u6027\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u9700\u53ef\u63a7\u4e14\u7c7b\u522b\u7279\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6807\u6ce8\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u659c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709GAN\u65b9\u6cd5\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u6a21\u5f0f\u574d\u7f29\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faToxiGAN\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u4e24\u6b65\u5b9a\u5411\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff1b2\uff09\u5229\u7528LLM\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u6027\u6587\u672c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u538b\u8231\u77f3\uff0c\u5e76\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u4e2d\u6027\u6837\u4f8b\uff1b3\uff09\u663e\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u6bd2\u6837\u672c\u8fdc\u79bb\u4e2d\u6027\u6837\u4f8b\u4ee5\u5f3a\u5316\u7c7b\u522b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cToxiGAN\u5728macro-F1\u548chate-F1\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f18\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u53caLLM-based\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u6d88\u878d\u4e0e\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u538b\u8231\u77f3\u548c\u5b9a\u5411\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ToxiGAN\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e0e\u5b9a\u5411\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6bd2\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u3001\u9ad8\u504f\u659c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6587\u672c\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Experiments on Guarani--Spanish and Quechua--Spanish translation show consistent chrF++ improvements from synthetic data augmentation, while diagnostic experiments on Aymara highlight the limitations of generic preprocessing for highly agglutinative languages.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u7f8e\u6d32\u571f\u8457\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5e73\u884c\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5b9a\u9884\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u5347\u795e\u7ecf\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u74dc\u62c9\u5c3c\u8bed-\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u8bed\u548c\u514b\u4e18\u4e9a\u8bed-\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u8bed\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u827e\u9a6c\u62c9\u8bed\u4e0a\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u571f\u8457\u8bed\u8a00\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u5e73\u884c\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u652f\u6491\u6709\u6548\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff08NMT\uff09\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u5bb9\u91cf\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u53e5\u5bf9\uff0c\u6269\u5145\u7f8e\u6d32\u571f\u8457\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u7cbe\u9009\u5e73\u884c\u8bed\u6599\uff1b\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03mBART\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6b63\u5b57\u6cd5\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u4e0e\u566a\u58f0\u611f\u77e5\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7b49\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u74dc\u62c9\u5c3c\u8bed-\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u8bed\u548c\u514b\u4e18\u4e9a\u8bed-\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cchrF++\u6307\u6807\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u800c\u5728\u827e\u9a6c\u62c9\u8bed\u4e0a\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u7528\u9884\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u914d\u9ad8\u5ea6\u9ecf\u7740\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u914d\u5408\u8bed\u8a00\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u9884\u5904\u7406\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u571f\u8457\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u9ad8\u5ea6\u9ecf\u7740\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

The Japanese bar examination is a particularly demanding benchmark, requiring not only advanced legal reasoning but also strict adherence to complex answer formats that involve joint evaluation of multiple propositions. While recent studies have reported improvements by decomposing such questions into simpler true--false judgments, these approaches have not been systematically evaluated under the original exam format and scoring scheme, leaving open the question of whether they truly capture exam-level competence. In this paper, we present a self-verification model trained on a newly constructed dataset that faithfully replicates the authentic format and evaluation scale of the exam. Our model is able to exceed the official passing score when evaluated on the actual exam scale, marking the first demonstration, to our knowledge, of an LLM passing the Japanese bar examination without altering its original question structure or scoring rules. We further conduct extensive comparisons with alternative strategies, including multi-agent inference and decomposition-based supervision, and find that these methods fail to achieve comparable performance. Our results highlight the importance of format-faithful supervision and consistency verification, and suggest that carefully designed single-model approaches can outperform more complex systems in high-stakes professional reasoning tasks.

We investigate this through systematic disentanglement experiments on distribution-based tasks, employing Cross-CoT experiments to isolate the effect of reasoning text from intrinsic model priors. We observe a distinct \"decoupled mechanism\": while CoT improves distributional alignment, final accuracy is dictated by CoT content (99% variance contribution), whereas distributional ranking is governed by model priors (over 80%). Step-wise analysis further shows that while CoT's influence on accuracy grows monotonically during the reasoning process, distributional structure is largely determined by LLM's intrinsic priors.

However, planning remains a bottleneck, as existing methods struggle with long-horizon strategies. Our analysis reveals a critical phenomenon, plan anchor, where the first reasoning step disproportionately impacts downstream behavior in long-horizon web reasoning tasks. Current RL algorithms, fail to account for this by uniformly distributing rewards across the trajectory. To address this, we propose Anchor-GRPO, a two-stage RL framework that decouples planning and execution. In Stage 1, the agent optimizes its first-step planning using fine-grained rubrics derived from self-play experiences and human calibration. In Stage 2, execution is aligned with the initial plan through sparse rewards, ensuring stable and efficient tool usage. We evaluate Anchor-GRPO on four benchmarks: BrowseComp, BrowseComp-Zh, GAIA, and XBench-DeepSearch.

We systematically evaluate five embedding similarity metrics across 816 transfer experiments spanning three NLP tasks, three African-centric multilingual models, and 12 languages from four language families. We find that cosine gap and retrieval-based metrics (P@1, CSLS) reliably predict transfer success ($\u03c1= 0.4-0.6$), while CKA shows negligible predictive power ($\u03c1\\approx 0.1$). Critically, correlation signs reverse when pooling across models (Simpson's Paradox), so practitioners must validate per-model.

To address these limitations, we propose PALU (Prefix-Aware Localized Unlearning), a framework driven by a local entropy maximization objective across both temporal and vocabulary dimensions. PALU reveals that (i) suppressing the sensitive prefix alone is sufficient to sever the causal generation link, and (ii) flattening only the top-$k$ logits is adequate to maximize uncertainty in the critical subspace.

While Large Language Models possess strong reasoning capabilities, they struggle to emulate this self-evolution: fine-tuning is computationally expensive and prone to catastrophic forgetting, while existing memory-based methods rely on passive semantic matching that often retrieves noise. To address these challenges, we propose MemRL, a framework that enables agents to self-evolve via non-parametric reinforcement learning on episodic memory. MemRL explicitly separates the stable reasoning of a frozen LLM from the plastic, evolving memory. Unlike traditional methods, MemRL employs a Two-Phase Retrieval mechanism that filters candidates by semantic relevance and then selects them based on learned Q-values (utility).

We propose a novel explainability-guided training framework, X-MuTeST (eXplainable Multilingual haTe Speech deTection), for hate speech detection that combines high-level semantic reasoning from large language models (LLMs) with traditional attention-enhancing techniques. We extend this research to Hindi and Telugu alongside English by providing benchmark human-annotated rationales for each word to justify the assigned class label. The X-MuTeST explainability method computes the difference between the prediction probabilities of the original text and those of unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams. Final explanations are computed as the union between LLM explanations and X-MuTeST explanations. We show that leveraging human rationales during training enhances both classification performance and explainability. Moreover, combining human rationales with our explainability method to refine the model attention yields further improvements. We evaluate explainability using Plausibility metrics such as Token-F1 and IOU-F1 and Faithfulness metrics such as Comprehensiveness and Sufficiency. By focusing on under-resourced languages, our work advances hate speech detection across diverse linguistic contexts.

Although Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has succeeded in specific domains , the field lacks large-scale, high-quality, and difficulty-calibrated data for general reasoning. To address this, we propose UltraLogic, a framework that decouples the logical core of a problem from its natural language expression through a Code-based Solving methodology to automate high-quality data production.

Furthermore, to mitigate binary reward sparsity and the Non-negative Reward Trap, we introduce the Bipolar Float Reward (BFR) mechanism, utilizing graded penalties to effectively distinguish perfect responses from those with logical flaws.

We formalize a core student-modeling problem as Malrule Reasoning Accuracy (MRA): infer a misconception from one worked mistake and predict the student's next answer under cross-template rephrasing. Across nine language models (4B-120B), accuracy drops from 66% on direct problem solving to 40% on cross-template misconception prediction. MalruleLib encodes 101 malrules over 498 parameterized problem templates and produces paired dual-path traces for both correct reasoning and malrule-consistent student reasoning. Because malrules are executable and templates are parameterizable, MalruleLib can generate over one million instances, enabling scalable supervision and controlled evaluation. Using MalruleLib, we observe cross-template degradations of 10-21%, while providing student step traces improves prediction by 3-15%.

Purpose: To create RXL-RADSet, a radiologist-verified synthetic multi-RADS benchmark, and compare validity and accuracy of open-weight small language models (SLMs) with a proprietary model for RADS assignment. Materials and Methods: RXL-RADSet contains 1,600 synthetic radiology reports across 10 RADS (BI-RADS, CAD-RADS, GB-RADS, LI-RADS, Lung-RADS, NI-RADS, O-RADS, PI-RADS, TI-RADS, VI-RADS) and multiple modalities. Reports were generated by LLMs using scenario plans and simulated radiologist styles and underwent two-stage radiologist verification. We evaluated 41 quantized SLMs (12 families, 0.135-32B parameters) and GPT-5.2 under a fixed guided prompt. Primary endpoints were validity and accuracy; a secondary analysis compared guided versus zero-shot prompting. Results: Under guided prompting GPT-5.2 achieved 99.8% validity and 81.1% accuracy (1,600 predictions). Pooled SLMs (65,600 predictions) achieved 96.8% validity and 61.1% accuracy; top SLMs in the 20-32B range reached ~99% validity and mid-to-high 70% accuracy. Performance scaled with model size (inflection between <1B and >=10B) and declined with RADS complexity primarily due to classification difficulty rather than invalid outputs. Guided prompting improved validity (99.2% vs 96.7%) and accuracy (78.5% vs 69.6%) compared with zero-shot.

This capability is vital for high-stakes decision-making in systems such as traffic networks, power grids, and disease propagation. However, the field remains underdeveloped because most existing works prioritize predictive accuracy over reasoning. To address the gap, we introduce ST-Bench, a benchmark consisting of four core tasks, including etiological reasoning, entity identification, correlation reasoning, and in-context forecasting, developed via a network SDE-based multi-agent data synthesis pipeline. We then propose STReasoner, which empowers LLM to integrate time series, graph structure, and text for explicit reasoning. To promote spatially grounded logic, we introduce S-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that rewards performance gains specifically attributable to spatial information. Experiments show that STReasoner achieves average accuracy gains between 17% and 135% at only 0.004X the cost of proprietary models and generalizes robustly to real-world data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faST-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\u548cSTReasoner\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u65f6\u7a7a\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7S-GRPO\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u589e\u5f3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5173\u6ce8\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65f6\u7a7a\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u5173\u952e\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982\u4ea4\u901a\u3001\u7535\u7f51\u3001\u75be\u75c5\u4f20\u64ad\uff09\u4e2d\u53d1\u5c55\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u56db\u7c7b\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684ST-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\uff1b\u63d0\u51faSTReasoner\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u3001\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1S-GRPO\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u5956\u52b1\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "result": "STReasoner\u5728\u5404\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u534717%\u2013135%\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u4ec5\u4e3a\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u76840.004X\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u7a7a\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\uff0cSTReasoner\u4e0eS-GRPO\u4e3a\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

However, few studies have focused on the interpretability of emergent languages. The research exposed in this paper proposes an Automated Semantic Rules Detection (ASRD) algorithm, which extracts relevant patterns in messages exchanged by agents trained with two different datasets on the Lewis Game, which is often studied in the context of emergent communication. ASRD helps at the interpretation of the emergent communication by relating the extracted patterns to specific attributes of the input data, thereby considerably simplifying subsequent analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u8bed\u4e49\u89c4\u5219\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08ASRD\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6d8c\u73b0\u901a\u4fe1\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728Lewis\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u5206\u6790\u4ee3\u7406\u95f4\u6d88\u606f\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u5c5e\u6027\u5173\u8054\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\u5173\u6ce8\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6d8c\u73b0\u901a\u4fe1\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u52a8\u8bed\u4e49\u89c4\u5219\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08ASRD\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728Lewis\u6e38\u620f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6240\u4ea4\u6362\u7684\u6d88\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u5f0f\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0a\u3002", "result": "ASRD\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u53d6\u6d88\u606f\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u5c5e\u6027\u5efa\u7acb\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u7b80\u5316\u540e\u7eed\u5bf9\u6d8c\u73b0\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0e\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "ASRD\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u6d8c\u73b0\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u81ea\u4e3b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5982\u4f55\u5f62\u6210\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}
