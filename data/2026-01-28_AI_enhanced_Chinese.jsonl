However, the increasing deployment of deep learning models has exposed them to various adversarial attacks, including backdoor attacks. This paper presents a novel dynamic mask-based backdoor attack method, specifically designed for object detection models. We exploit a dataset poisoning technique to embed a malicious trigger, rendering any models trained on this compromised dataset vulnerable to our backdoor attack. We particularly focus on a mushroom detection dataset to demonstrate the practical risks posed by such attacks on critical real-life domains. Our work also emphasizes the importance of creating a detailed backdoor attack scenario to illustrate the significant risks associated with the outsourcing practice. Our approach leverages SAM, a recent and powerful image segmentation AI model, to create masks for dynamic trigger placement, introducing a new and stealthy attack method. Through extensive experimentation, we show that our sophisticated attack scenario maintains high accuracy on clean data with the YOLOv7 object detection model while achieving high attack success rates on poisoned samples. Our approach surpasses traditional methods for backdoor injection, which are based on static and consistent patterns. Our findings underscore the urgent need for robust countermeasures to protect deep learning models from these evolving adversarial threats.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528SAM\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08\u5982YOLOv7\uff09\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u9690\u853d\u6027\u3001\u9ad8\u6210\u529f\u7387\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u6ce8\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u8611\u83c7\u68c0\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e3a\u4f8b\u63ed\u793a\u5916\u5305\u8bad\u7ec3\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u591a\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5916\u5305\u8bad\u7ec3\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6570\u636e\u6295\u6bd2\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u98ce\u9669\u4e9f\u5f85\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u9759\u6001\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u65b9\u6cd5\u9690\u853d\u6027\u5dee\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f31\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eSAM\uff08Segment Anything Model\uff09\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u6001\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6295\u6bd2\u5d4c\u5165\u53ef\u53d8\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0e\u5f62\u6001\u7684\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u5bf9\u8c61\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982YOLOv7\uff09\u5b9e\u65bd\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8611\u83c7\u68c0\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1a\u653b\u51fb\u540e\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5e72\u51c0\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5bf9\u5e26\u89e6\u53d1\u6837\u672c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u9759\u6001\u89e6\u53d1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u52a8\u6001\u63a9\u7801\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u6784\u6210\u65b0\u578b\u4e25\u91cd\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u5f00\u53d1\u9c81\u68d2\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7d27\u8feb\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9700\u91cd\u89c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6e90\u53ef\u4fe1\u6027\u4e0e\u5916\u5305\u6d41\u7a0b\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}

Recent advances in 3D Morphable Model (3DMM)-based facial reconstruction methods have achieved remarkable high-fidelity face estimation. However, on the one hand, they struggle to capture the entire head, including non-facial regions and background details in real time, which is an essential aspect for producing realistic, high-fidelity head avatars. On the other hand, recent approaches leveraging generative adversarial networks (GANs) for head avatar generation from videos can achieve high-quality reenactments but encounter limitations in reproducing fine-grained head details, such as wrinkles and hair textures. In addition, existing methods generally rely on a large amount of training data, and rarely focus on using only a simple selfie video to achieve avatar reenactment. To address these challenges, this study introduces a method for detailed head avatar reenactment using a selfie video. The approach combines 3DMMs with a StyleGAN-based generator. A detailed reconstruction model is proposed, incorporating mixed loss functions for foreground reconstruction and avatar image generation during adversarial training to recover high-frequency details.

Manual interpretation from this imagery is labor-intensive and error-prone, underscoring the need for automatic and reliable detection across varying scenes. Yet, such automatic detection is challenging due to severe background heterogeneity, dominant empty terrain (class imbalance), small or occluded targets, and wide variation in density and scale. To make the detection model (HerdNet) more robust to these challenges, a weakly supervised patch-level pretraining based on a detection network's architecture is proposed. The detection dataset includes five caribou herds distributed across Alaska. By learning from empty vs. non-empty labels in this dataset, the approach produces early weakly supervised knowledge for enhanced detection compared to HerdNet, which is initialized from generic weights. Accordingly, the patch-based pretrain network attained high accuracy on multi-herd imagery (2017) and on an independent year's (2019) test sets (F1: 93.7%/92.6%, respectively), enabling reliable mapping of regions containing animals to facilitate manual counting on large aerial imagery. Transferred to detection, initialization from weakly supervised pretraining yielded consistent gains over ImageNet weights on both positive patches (F1: 92.6%/93.5% vs. 89.3%/88.6%), and full-image counting (F1: 95.5%/93.3% vs. 91.5%/90.4%).

This study introduces an empirical learning framework that derives these trade-offs directly from naturalistic trajectory data. A unified objective space represents each AV timestep through composite scores of safety, efficiency, and interaction. Pareto dominance is applied to identify non-dominated states, forming an empirical frontier that defines the attainable region of balanced performance.\n  The proposed framework was demonstrated using the Third Generation Simulation (TGSIM) datasets from Foggy Bottom and I-395. Results showed that only 0.23\\% of AV driving instances were Pareto-optimal, underscoring the rarity of simultaneous optimization across objectives. Pareto-optimal states showed notably higher mean scores for safety, efficiency, and interaction compared to non-optimal cases, with interaction showing the greatest potential for improvement.\n  This minimally invasive and modular framework, which requires only kinematic and positional data, can be directly applied beyond the scope of this study to derive and visualize multi-objective learning surfaces", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\u5206\u6790\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u4e09\u8005\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5728TGSIM\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e73\u8861\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u662f\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u884c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4ece\u771f\u5b9e\u9a7e\u9a76\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u63a8\u5bfc\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6743\u8861\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u590d\u5408\u5f97\u5206\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u4f18\u52bf\u8bc6\u522b\u975e\u652f\u914d\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u7ecf\u9a8c\u524d\u6cbf\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528Foggy Bottom\u548cI-395\u7684TGSIM\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u4ec50.23%\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5b9e\u4f8b\u8fbe\u5230\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\uff1b\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u72b6\u6001\u5728\u4e09\u9879\u76ee\u6807\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u5f97\u5206\u5747\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u6f5c\u529b\u6700\u5927\uff1b\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4ec5\u9700\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u4e0e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u4e0e\u4f4e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5b66\u4e60\u66f2\u9762\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684AV\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

Vision-based motion capture tools have made significant progress, offering accessible and visually convincing results, yet often fall short in the final stretch -- the last mile -- when it comes to physical realism and production readiness, due to various artifacts introduced during capture. In this paper, we summarize key issues through case studies and feedback from professional animators to set a stepping stone for future research in motion cleanup. We then present a physics-based motion refinement framework to bridge the gap, with the goal of reducing labor-intensive manual cleanup and enhancing visual quality and physical realism. Our framework supports both single- and multi-character sequences and can be integrated into animator workflows for further refinement, such as stylizing motions via keyframe editing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u7cbe\u70bc\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u89c9\u52a8\u6355\u6570\u636e\u5728\u7269\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u5236\u4f5c\u5c31\u7eea\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u2018\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u82f1\u91cc\u2019\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u624b\u52a8\u6e05\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u7269\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u52a8\u6355\u5de5\u5177\u867d\u5df2\u53d6\u5f97\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7269\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u751f\u4ea7\u5c31\u7eea\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u7f3a\u9677\uff08\u5982\u5404\u7c7b\u6355\u6349\u4f2a\u5f71\uff09\uff0c\u4e13\u4e1a\u52a8\u753b\u5e08\u53cd\u9988\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u6e05\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u753b\u5e08\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u53cd\u9988\u603b\u7ed3\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u4e2a\u652f\u6301\u5355/\u591a\u89d2\u8272\u3001\u53ef\u96c6\u6210\u81f3\u52a8\u753b\u5e08\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff08\u5982\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u7f16\u8f91\uff09\u7684\u7269\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u8fd0\u52a8\u7cbe\u70bc\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u6e05\u7406\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8fd0\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u540e\u7eed\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u7cbe\u70bc\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u52a8\u6355\u6570\u636e\u751f\u4ea7\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u8fd0\u52a8\u6e05\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u4e0e\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Some of these technologies enable the automation of individual tasks, while others focus on orchestrating the execution of end-to-end processes. The rise of Generative and Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) is opening the way for another such wave. However, this wave is poised to be different because it shifts the focus from automation to autonomy and from design-driven management of business processes to data-driven management, leveraging process mining techniques. This position paper, based on a keynote talk at the 2025 Workshop on AI for BPM, outlines how process mining has laid the foundations on top of which agents can sense process states, reason about improvement opportunities, and act to maintain and optimize performance. The paper proposes an architectural vision for Agentic Business Process Management Systems (A-BPMS): a new class of platforms that integrate autonomy, reasoning, and learning into process management and execution. The paper contends that such systems must support a continuum of processes, spanning from human-driven to fully autonomous, thus redefining the boundaries of process automation and governance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08AI\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u63a8\u52a8\u4e1a\u52a1\u6d41\u7a0b\u7ba1\u7406\uff08BPM\uff09\u4ece\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8fc8\u5411\u81ea\u4e3b\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6316\u6398\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e1a\u52a1\u6d41\u7a0b\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08A-BPMS\uff09\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4ece\u4eba\u5de5\u9a71\u52a8\u5230\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u4e3b\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\u8fde\u7eed\u4f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfBPM\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u65b0\u4e00\u4ee3\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u6b63\u63a8\u52a8\u5176\u5411\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u3001\u81ea\u4e3b\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u6d41\u7a0b\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0e\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6316\u6398\u6280\u672f\u6784\u5efa\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e1a\u52a1\u6d41\u7a0b\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08A-BPMS\uff09\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4f7f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u5907\u611f\u77e5\u6d41\u7a0b\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u4f1a\u5e76\u81ea\u4e3b\u6267\u884c\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86A-BPMS\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u613f\u666f\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5176\u9700\u652f\u6301\u4eba\u7c7b\u9a71\u52a8\u81f3\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u4e3b\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\u8fde\u7eed\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u878d\u5408\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "Agentic AI\u5c06\u91cd\u5851BPM\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u4ece\u6d41\u7a0b\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5347\u7ea7\u4e3a\u6d41\u7a0b\u81ea\u6cbb\uff1bA-BPMS\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b0\u4e00\u4ee3\u6d41\u7a0b\u7ba1\u7406\u5e73\u53f0\u3002"}}

Accepted to AISTATS 2026", "summary": "As generative models continue to evolve, detecting AI-generated images remains a critical challenge. While effective detection methods exist, they often lack formal interpretability and may rely on implicit assumptions about fake content, potentially limiting robustness to distributional shifts. In this work, we introduce a rigorous, statistically grounded framework for fake image detection that focuses on producing a probability score interpretable with respect to the real-image population.

Despite this, representation learning for depth modality remains underexplored compared to RGB, where large-scale foundation models now define the state of the art. To address this gap, we present DeFM, a self-supervised foundation model trained entirely on depth images for robotic applications. Using a DINO-style self-distillation objective on a curated dataset of 60M depth images, DeFM learns geometric and semantic representations that generalize to diverse environments, tasks, and sensors. To retain metric awareness across multiple scales, we introduce a novel input normalization strategy. We further distill DeFM into compact models suitable for resource-constrained robotic systems. When evaluated on depth-based classification, segmentation, navigation, locomotion, and manipulation benchmarks, DeFM achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates strong generalization from simulation to real-world environments. We release all our pretrained models, which can be adopted off-the-shelf for depth-based robotic learning without task-specific fine-tuning.

However, due to differences in representation and ren dering pipelines, existing studies render meshes and 3DGS separately, making it difficult to accurately handle occlusions and transparency. Moreover, the deformed 3DGS still suffers from visual artifacts due to the sensitivity to the topology quality of the proxy mesh. These issues pose serious obsta cles to the joint use of 3DGS and meshes, making it diffi cult to adapt 3DGS to conventional mesh-oriented graphics pipelines. We propose UniMGS, the first unified framework for rasterizing mesh and 3DGS in a single-pass anti-aliased manner, with a novel binding strategy for 3DGS deformation based on proxy mesh. Our key insight is to blend the col ors of both triangle and Gaussian fragments by anti-aliased \u03b1-blending in a single pass, achieving visually coherent re sults with precise handling of occlusion and transparency. To improve the visual appearance of the deformed 3DGS, our Gaussian-centric binding strategy employs a proxy mesh and spatially associates Gaussians with the mesh faces, signifi cantly reducing rendering artifacts. With these two compo nents, UniMGS enables the visualization and manipulation of 3D objects represented by mesh or 3DGS within a unified framework, opening up new possibilities in embodied AI, vir tual reality, and gaming.

Existing knowledge probes evaluate model capabilities through metrics like prediction accuracy and precision. Such evaluations fail to account for the model's reliability, reflected in the calibration of its confidence scores. In this paper, we propose a novel calibration probing framework for relational knowledge, covering three modalities of model confidence: (1) intrinsic confidence, (2) structural consistency and (3) semantic grounding. Our extensive analysis of ten causal and six masked language models reveals that most models, especially those pre-trained with the masking objective, are overconfident. The best-calibrated scores come from confidence estimates that account for inconsistencies due to statement rephrasing. Moreover, even the largest pre-trained models fail to encode the semantics of linguistic confidence expressions accurately.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u77e5\u8bc6\u6821\u51c6\u63a2\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u5185\u5728\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u57fa\u7840\u4e09\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u6570\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u63a9\u7801\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u7f16\u7801\u8bed\u8a00\u7f6e\u4fe1\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u63a2\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7b49\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u6027\uff08\u5373\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6240\u5b66\u5173\u7cfb\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u6821\u51c6\u63a2\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u5185\u5728\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08\u5982\u9648\u8ff0\u91cd\u8ff0\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff09\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u57fa\u7840\u4e09\u65b9\u9762\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5173\u7cfb\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u6821\u51c6\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5341\u79cd\u56e0\u679c\u578b\u548c\u516d\u79cd\u63a9\u7801\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u63a9\u7801\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u663e\u8457\u8fc7\u81ea\u4fe1\uff1b\u8003\u8651\u91cd\u8ff0\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u4f30\u8ba1\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\uff1b\u5373\u4f7f\u6700\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u662f\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5173\u7cfb\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ec5\u9760\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b\u672a\u6765\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u7f6e\u4fe1\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u7f6e\u4fe1\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

We explore whether large language models embedded in an evolutionary loop can be used to design optimisation problems with clearly defined high-level landscape characteristics. Using the LLaMEA framework, we guide an LLM to generate problem code from natural-language descriptions of target properties, including multimodality, separability, basin-size homogeneity, search-space homogeneity and globallocal optima contrast. Inside the loop we score candidates through ELA-based property predictors. We introduce an ELA-space fitness-sharing mechanism that increases population diversity and steers the generator away from redundant landscapes. A complementary basin-of-attraction analysis, statistical testing and visual inspection, verifies that many of the generated functions indeed exhibit the intended structural traits. In addition, a t-SNE embedding shows that they expand the BBOB instance space rather than forming an unrelated cluster.

The framework is demonstrated on a challenging real-world dataset of hourly cryptocurrency returns, illustrating how latent similarity induces coherent network structure; a classical econometric relation is also reported as an external diagnostic lens to contextualize discovered edges.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u53d1\u73b0\u5c42\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6784\u5efa\u5b9e\u4f53\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u5047\u8bbe\u56fe\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ebf\u6027\u3001\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u6216\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u8bbe\u7edf\u8ba1\u5047\u8bbe\uff08\u5982\u7ebf\u6027\u3001\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\uff09\u6216\u7279\u5b9a\u4e0b\u6e38\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4ece\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5173\u7cfb\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5e8f\u5217\u5230\u5e8f\u5217\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7a97\u53e3\u7ea7\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u805a\u5408\u4e3a\u5b9e\u4f53\u7ea7\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u9608\u503c\u5316\u6784\u5efa\u7a00\u758f\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5c0f\u65f6\u7ea7\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u6536\u76ca\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u51dd\u805a\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u5178\u8ba1\u91cf\u5173\u7cfb\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5916\u90e8\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u89e3\u91ca\u6240\u53d1\u73b0\u8fb9\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u53d1\u73b0\u5c42\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u5206\u6790\u3001\u53ef\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u53d1\u73b0\u800c\u975e\u9884\u6d4b\u6216\u51b3\u7b56\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

However, current approaches predominantly rely on unimodal RGB pre-training, overlooking the complex 3D geometry inherent to surgical environments. Although several architectures support multimodal or geometry-aware inputs in general computer vision, the benefits of incorporating depth information in surgical settings remain underexplored. We conduct a large-scale empirical study comparing eight ViT-based VFMs that differ in pre-training domain, learning objective, and input modality (RGB vs. RGB-D). For pre-training, we use a curated dataset of 1.4 million robotic surgical images paired with depth maps generated from an off-the-shelf network. We evaluate these models under both frozen-backbone and end-to-end fine-tuning protocols across eight surgical datasets spanning object detection, segmentation, depth estimation, and pose estimation. Our experiments yield several consistent findings. Models incorporating explicit geometric tokenization, such as MultiMAE, substantially outperform unimodal baselines across all tasks. Notably, geometric-aware pre-training enables remarkable data efficiency: models fine-tuned on just 25% of labeled data consistently surpass RGB-only models trained on the full dataset. Importantly, these gains require no architectural or runtime changes at inference; depth is used only during pre-training, making adoption straightforward. These findings suggest that multimodal pre-training offers a viable path towards building more capable surgical vision systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u516b\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eViT\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\uff08RGB-D\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08\u5982MultiMAE\uff09\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5404\u7c7b\u624b\u672f\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u6539\u53d8\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u6216\u8fd0\u884c\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u624b\u672f\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u6a21\u6001RGB\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u624b\u672f\u73af\u5883\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u590d\u67423D\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u800c\u6df1\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4ef7\u503c\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b140\u4e07\u5f20\u914d\u5bf9RGB-\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u7684\u624b\u672f\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u516b\u79cdViT-based VFM\uff08\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9886\u57df\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u6a21\u6001\u4e0a\u4e0d\u540c\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u51bb\u7ed3\u4e3b\u5e72\u548c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5fae\u8c03\u4e24\u79cd\u534f\u8bae\u4e0b\uff0c\u5728\u516b\u4e2a\u6db5\u76d6\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5206\u5272\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u4f4d\u59ff\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u624b\u672f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u663e\u5f0f\u51e0\u4f55tokenization\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982MultiMAE\uff09\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u4ec5\u752825%\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5373\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f7f\u7528\u5168\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684RGB-only\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u8be5\u589e\u76ca\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u56e0\u6df1\u5ea6\u4ec5\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\uff08RGB-D\uff09\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u662f\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u624b\u672f\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e00\u6761\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Across models and languages, we observe consistent behavioral patterns, including incentive-sensitive conditional strategies and cross-linguistic divergence. To interpret these dynamics, we train supervised classifiers on canonical repeated-game strategies and apply them to LLM decisions, revealing systematic, model- and language-dependent behavioral intentions, with linguistic framing sometimes matching or exceeding architectural effects.

Most existing humanoids are either closed industrial systems or academic prototypes that are difficult to deploy and operate around people, limiting progress in robotics. We introduce Sprout, a developer platform designed to address these limitations through an emphasis on safety, expressivity, and developer accessibility. Sprout adopts a lightweight form factor with compliant control, limited joint torques, and soft exteriors to support safe operation in shared human spaces. The platform integrates whole-body control, manipulation with integrated grippers, and virtual-reality-based teleoperation within a unified hardware-software stack.

While prior work has focused on explanation fluency and relevance under fixed inputs, the robustness of LLM-generated explanations to realistic user behavior noise remains largely unexplored. In real-world web platforms, interaction histories are inherently noisy due to accidental clicks, temporal inconsistencies, missing values, and evolving preferences, raising concerns about explanation stability and user trust. We present RobustExplain, the first systematic evaluation framework for measuring the robustness of LLM-generated recommendation explanations. RobustExplain introduces five realistic user behavior perturbations evaluated across multiple severity levels and a multi-dimensional robustness metric capturing semantic, keyword, structural, and length consistency. Our goal is to establish a principled, task-level evaluation framework and initial robustness baselines, rather than to provide a comprehensive leaderboard across all available LLMs. Experiments on four representative LLMs (7B--70B) show that current models exhibit only moderate robustness, with larger models achieving up to 8% higher stability.

We developed a wearable haptic device that transfers liquid and air into flexible containers mounted on the back of the user's hand, allowing us to independently manipulate weight and pressure. Through an initial evaluation using three conditions-no feedback, weight only, and weight combined with pressure-we examined how these signals affect perceived heaviness, coherence with visual cues, and the perceived urgency of notifications. Our results validate that pressure amplifies the perception of weight, but this increased heaviness does not translate into higher perceived urgency.

We approach this problem from a data-centric perspective, finding that not all training samples contribute equally to the SD acceptance rate. Specifically, our theoretical analysis and empirical validation reveals that tokens inducing flatter predictive distributions from the target model are more valuable than those yielding sharply peaked distributions. Based on this insight, we propose flatness, a new metric to quantify this property, and develop the Sample-level-flatness-based Dataset Distillation (SFDD) approach, which filters the training data to retain only the most valuable samples. Experiments on the EAGLE framework demonstrate that SFDD can achieve over 2$\\times$ training speedup using only 50% of the data, while keeping the final model's inference speedup within 4% of the full-dataset baseline. This work introduces an effective, data-centric approach that substantially improves the training efficiency for Speculative Decoding.

While machine learning models provide point predictions, they lack explainable uncertainty quantification essential for risk-aware decision-making in safety-critical infrastructure. This study develops an Interval Type-2 Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (IT2-ANFIS) that generates interpretable prediction intervals through fuzzy rule structures. Unlike black-box probabilistic methods, the proposed framework decomposes uncertainty across three levels: feature-level, footprint of uncertainty identify which variables introduce ambiguity, rule-level analysis reveals confidence in local models, and instance-level intervals quantify overall prediction uncertainty. Validated on Melbourne Water's Eastern Treatment Plant dataset, IT2-ANFIS achieves comparable predictive performance to first order ANFIS with substantially reduced variance across training runs, while providing explainable uncertainty estimates that link prediction confidence directly to operational conditions and input variables.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u533a\u95f4\u4e8c\u578b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u7cca\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08IT2-ANFIS\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6c61\u6c34\u5904\u7406\u5382\u80fd\u8017\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u51c6\u786e\u70b9\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u5c42\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u89e3\uff08\u7279\u5f81\u7ea7\u3001\u89c4\u5219\u7ea7\u3001\u6837\u672c\u7ea7\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u51b3\u7b56\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6c61\u6c34\u5904\u7406\u5382\u8017\u7535\u91cf\u5360\u5168\u74031-3%\uff0c\u9700\u7cbe\u51c6\u80fd\u8017\u9884\u6d4b\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u8fd0\u884c\u4e0e\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u533a\u95f4\u4e8c\u578b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u7cca\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08IT2-ANFIS\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u7cca\u89c4\u5219\u7ed3\u6784\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u7ea7\u3001\u89c4\u5219\u7ea7\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c42\u9762\u5206\u89e3\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u58a8\u5c14\u672c\u4e1c\u90e8\u6c61\u6c34\u5904\u7406\u5382\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cIT2-ANFIS\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u4e00\u9636ANFIS\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u5dee\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u76f4\u63a5\u5173\u8054\u81f3\u8fd0\u884c\u5de5\u51b5\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u53d8\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "IT2-ANFIS\u517c\u987e\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u80fd\u6e90\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9762\u5411\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

The implemented QRL approaches are quantum analogues of the classical neural-network-based Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient and Deep Q-Network algorithms. Through an empirical evaluation on real-world financial data, we show that our quantum agents achieve risk-adjusted performance comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, that of classical Deep RL models with several orders of magnitude more parameters. In addition to improved parameter efficiency, quantum agents exhibit reduced variability across market regimes, indicating robust behaviour under changing conditions. However, while quantum circuit execution is inherently fast at the hardware level, practical deployment on cloud-based quantum systems introduces substantial latency, making end-to-end runtime currently dominated by infrastructural overhead and limiting practical applicability. Taken together, our results suggest that QRL is theoretically competitive with state-of-the-art classical reinforcement learning and may become practically advantageous as deployment overheads diminish. This positions QRL as a promising paradigm for dynamic decision-making in complex, high-dimensional, and non-stationary environments such as financial markets.

Experiments on a segmentation model for embryo images shows that the proposed smart averaging strategy is able to tolerate two orders of magnitude stronger noise in the communication channels compared to conventional averaging, while still maintaining the accuracy of the final model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Split-Federated\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u901a\u4fe1\u4fe1\u9053\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u667a\u80fd\u5e73\u5747\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u6297\u566a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u80da\u80ce\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "SplitFed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u901a\u4fe1\u4fe1\u9053\u566a\u58f0\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411SplitFed\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u5e73\u5747\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u901a\u4fe1\u4fe1\u9053\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u80da\u80ce\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u5bb9\u5fcd\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u5e73\u5747\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6700\u7ec8\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u667a\u80fd\u5e73\u5747\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86SplitFed\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u4fe1\u9053\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

For example, an e-commerce platform may require every recommendation list to include items from multiple sellers and at least one newly listed product; violating such constraints--even once--is unacceptable in production. Prior work on multi-objective recommendation and recent LLM-based recommender agents largely treat constraints as soft penalties or focus on item scoring and interaction, leading to frequent violations in real-world deployments. How to leverage LLMs for coordinating constrained optimization in recommendation systems remains underexplored. We propose DualAgent-Rec, an LLM-coordinated dual-agent framework for constrained multi-objective e-commerce recommendation. The framework separates optimization into an Exploitation Agent that prioritizes accuracy under hard constraints and an Exploration Agent that promotes diversity through unconstrained Pareto search. An LLM-based coordinator adaptively allocates resources between agents based on optimization progress and constraint satisfaction, while an adaptive epsilon-relaxation mechanism guarantees feasibility of final solutions. Experiments on the Amazon Reviews 2023 dataset demonstrate that DualAgent-Rec achieves 100% constraint satisfaction and improves Pareto hypervolume by 4-6% over strong baselines, while maintaining competitive accuracy-diversity trade-offs. These results indicate that LLMs can act as effective orchestration agents for deployable and constraint-compliant recommendation systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDualAgent-Rec\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u534f\u8c03\u53cc\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u5e26\u786c\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u7535\u5546\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0100%\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u5e76\u63d0\u5347Pareto\u524d\u6cbf\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5904\u7406\u786c\u6027\u4e1a\u52a1\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u5982\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3001\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff09\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5e38\u5c06\u7ea6\u675f\u89c6\u4e3a\u8f6f\u60e9\u7f5a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9891\u7e41\u8fdd\u89c4\uff1b\u800cLLM\u5728\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u4f18\u5316\u4f5c\u7528\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDualAgent-Rec\uff1a\u7531\u4e13\u6ce8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u786c\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u7684Exploitation Agent\u548c\u4e13\u6ce8\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u65e0\u7ea6\u675fPareto\u641c\u7d22\u7684Exploration Agent\u7ec4\u6210\uff1bLLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u534f\u8c03\u5668\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u914d\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94epsilon\u677e\u5f1b\u673a\u5236\u4fdd\u969c\u89e3\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728Amazon Reviews 2023\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cDualAgent-Rec\u5b9e\u73b0100%\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\uff0cPareto\u8d85\u4f53\u79ef\u63d0\u53474\u20136%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027-\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u7f16\u6392\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u652f\u6491\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u3001\u5f3a\u7ea6\u675f\u5408\u89c4\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

These assumptions are mismatched to baby language models trained on developmentally plausible input such as child-directed speech and early-childhood narratives, and they obscure which reasoning abilities (if any) emerge under such constraints. We introduce BabyReasoningBench, a GPT-5.2 generated benchmark of 19 reasoning tasks grounded in classic paradigms from developmental psychology, spanning theory of mind, analogical and relational reasoning, causal inference and intervention selection, and core reasoning primitives that are known to be confounded by memory and pragmatics. We find that two GPT-2 based baby language models (pretrained on 10M and 100M of child-directed speech text) show overall low but uneven performance, with dissociations across task families: scaling improves several causal and physical reasoning tasks, while belief attribution and pragmatics-sensitive tasks remain challenging. BabyReasoningBench provides a developmentally grounded lens for analyzing what kinds of reasoning are supported by child-like training distributions, and for testing mechanistic hypotheses about how such abilities emerge.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86BabyReasoningBench\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d1\u5c55\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u7ecf\u5178\u8303\u5f0f\u768419\u9879\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u513f\u7ae5\u5bfc\u5411\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u201c\u5a74\u513f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u201d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5927\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u90e8\u5206\u56e0\u679c\u548c\u7269\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u5fc3\u7406\u7406\u8bba\uff08\u5982\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5f52\u56e0\uff09\u548c\u8bed\u7528\u654f\u611f\u4efb\u52a1\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u63a8\u7406\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u4ee5\u6210\u4eba\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3001\u9884\u8bbe\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e38\u8bc6\u4e0e\u6210\u719f\u8bed\u7528\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u513f\u7ae5\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u201c\u5a74\u513f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u201d\uff0c\u56e0\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u771f\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaBabyReasoningBench\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u4e2a\u7531GPT-5.2\u751f\u6210\u3001\u6db5\u76d6\u5fc3\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u7c7b\u6bd4\u4e0e\u5173\u7cfb\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u4e0e\u5e72\u9884\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u57fa\u7840\u63a8\u7406\u539f\u8bed\u7b49\u4e94\u5927\u7c7b\u517119\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u9a71\u52a8\u57fa\u51c6\uff1b\u5e76\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eGPT-2\u3001\u5206\u522b\u572810M\u548c100M\u513f\u7ae5\u5bfc\u5411\u8bed\u97f3\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u201c\u5a74\u513f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u201d\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u4e24\u4e2a\u5a74\u513f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u504f\u4f4e\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u5206\u79bb\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u5927\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u90e8\u5206\u56e0\u679c\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u800c\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5f52\u56e0\u4e0e\u8bed\u7528\u654f\u611f\u4efb\u52a1\u4ecd\u663e\u8457\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "conclusion": "BabyReasoningBench\u4e3a\u5728\u7c7b\u513f\u7ae5\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53d1\u5c55\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5bf9\u76f8\u5173\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\u7684\u53ef\u68c0\u9a8c\u5047\u8bbe\u3002"}}

Existing benchmarks conflate task complexity with structural ordering, making it difficult to isolate the impact of prompt topology on performance. We introduce RIFT, Reordered Instruction Following Testbed, to assess instruction following by disentangling structure from content. Using rephrased Jeopardy! question-answer pairs, we test LLMs across two prompt structures: linear prompts, which progress sequentially, and jumping prompts, which preserve identical content but require non-sequential traversal. Across 10,000 evaluations spanning six state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, accuracy dropped by up to 72% under jumping conditions (compared to baseline), revealing a strong dependence on positional continuity. Error analysis shows that approximately 50% of failures stem from instruction-order violations and semantic drift, indicating that current architectures internalize instruction following as a sequential pattern rather than a reasoning skill. These results reveal structural sensitivity as a fundamental limitation in current architectures, with direct implications for applications requiring non-sequential control flow such as workflow automation and multi-agent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86RIFT\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u6392\u5e8f\u6307\u4ee4\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u987a\u5e8f\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ea650%\u7684\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u975e\u987a\u5e8f\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6839\u672c\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u987a\u5e8f\u6df7\u6742\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5206\u79bb\u63d0\u793a\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u9700\u4e13\u95e8\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5bf9\u6307\u4ee4\u987a\u5e8f\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaRIFT\uff08Reordered Instruction Following Testbed\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6539\u5199\u540e\u7684Jeopardy!\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ebf\u6027\u63d0\u793a\uff08\u987a\u5e8f\u6267\u884c\uff09\u4e0e\u8df3\u8dc3\u63d0\u793a\uff08\u5185\u5bb9\u76f8\u540c\u4f46\u9700\u975e\u987a\u5e8f\u904d\u5386\uff09\u4e24\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u57286\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90SOTA LLM\u4e0a\u5f00\u5c5510,000\u6b21\u8bc4\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u8df3\u8dc3\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\u4e0b\u964d72%\uff1b\u7ea650%\u9519\u8bef\u6e90\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u987a\u5e8f\u8fdd\u53cd\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u7684\u5f3a\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u5c06\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u5185\u5316\u4e3a\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u5f0f\u800c\u975e\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u654f\u611f\u6027\u662f\u5176\u6839\u672c\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5236\u7ea6 workflow automation \u548c multi-agent systems \u7b49\u9700\u975e\u987a\u5e8f\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Once trained, one can hope to detect out-of-distribution (abnormal) latent vectors, but several issues arise when the latent space is high dimensional. This includes an exponential growth of the hypervolume with the dimension, which severely affects the generative capacity of the VAE. In this paper, we draw insights from high dimensional statistics: in these regimes, the latent vectors of a standard VAE are distributed on the `equators' of a hypersphere, challenging the detection of anomalies. We propose to formulate the latent variables of a VAE using hyperspherical coordinates, which allows compressing the latent vectors towards a given direction on the hypersphere, thereby allowing for a more expressive approximate posterior. We show that this improves both the fully unsupervised and OOD anomaly detection ability of the VAE, achieving the best performance on the datasets we considered, outperforming existing methods.

In few-shot NVS, where only a few input views are available, existing methods often assume equal importance for all input views relative to the target, leading to suboptimal results.\n  We address this limitation by introducing a camera-weighting mechanism that adjusts the importance of source views based on their relevance to the target. We propose two approaches: a deterministic weighting scheme leveraging geometric properties like Euclidean distance and angular differences, and a cross-attention-based learning scheme that optimizes view weighting.

Vision-based alternatives often require substantial computation, introduce latency, and degrade in real-world conditions. In this work, we present a high accuracy, real-time pipeline for continuous Braille recognition using Evetac, an open-source neuromorphic event-based tactile sensor. Unlike frame-based vision systems, the neuromorphic tactile modality directly encodes dynamic contact events during continuous sliding, closely emulating human finger-scanning strategies. Our approach combines spatiotemporal segmentation with a lightweight ResNet-based classifier to process sparse event streams, enabling robust character recognition across varying indentation depths and scanning speeds. The proposed system achieves near-perfect accuracy (>=98%) at standard depths, generalizes across multiple Braille board layouts, and maintains strong performance under fast scanning. On a physical Braille board containing daily-living vocabulary, the system attains over 90% word-level accuracy, demonstrating robustness to temporal compression effects that challenge conventional methods.

While rendering for such devices is expensive, most of the content falls into peripheral vision, where human perception differs from that in the fovea. Consequently, it is critical to understand and leverage the limitations of visual perception to enable efficient rendering. A standard approach is to exploit the reduced sensitivity to spatial details in the periphery by reducing rendering resolution, so-called foveated rendering. While this strategy avoids rendering part of the content altogether, an alternative promising direction is to replace accurate and expensive rendering with inexpensive synthesis of content that is perceptually indistinguishable from the ground-truth image. In this paper, we propose such a method for the efficient generation of an image signal that substitutes the rendering of high-frequency details. The method is grounded in findings from image statistics, which show that preserving appropriate local statistics is critical for perceived image quality. Based on this insight, we extrapolate several local image statistics from foveated content into higher spatial frequency ranges that are attenuated or omitted in the rendering process.

Turing's foundational result established the Halting Problem as undecidable, showing that no algorithm can universally determine termination for all programs and inputs. Consequently, automatic verification tools approximate termination, sometimes failing to prove or disprove; these tools rely on problem-specific architectures and abstractions, and are usually tied to particular programming languages. Recent success and progress in large language models (LLMs) raises the following question: can LLMs reliably predict program termination? In this work, we evaluate LLMs on a diverse set of C programs from the Termination category of the International Competition on Software Verification (SV-Comp) 2025. Our results suggest that LLMs perform remarkably well at predicting program termination, where GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet-4.5 would rank just behind the top-ranked tool (using test-time-scaling), and Code World Model (CWM) would place just behind the second-ranked tool. While LLMs are effective at predicting program termination, they often fail to provide a valid witness as a proof. Moreover, LLMs performance drops as program length increases. We hope these insights motivate further research into program termination and the broader potential of LLMs for reasoning about undecidable problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u9884\u6d4bC\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7ec8\u6b62\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0GPT-5\u548cClaude Sonnet-4.5\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u5728SV-Comp 2025\u7ec8\u6b62\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u9876\u5c16\u4e13\u7528\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u7ec8\u6b62\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u7a0b\u5e8f\u957f\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7LLM\u5728\u5404\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u8fdb\u5c55\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u5176\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u89e3\u51b3\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u5224\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u2014\u2014\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7ec8\u6b62\u6027\u5224\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u5728SV-Comp 2025\u7ec8\u6b62\u6027\u7c7b\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316C\u7a0b\u5e8f\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8bc4\u6d4b\u591a\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41LLM\uff08\u5982GPT-5\u3001Claude Sonnet-4.5\u3001Code World Model\uff09\u7684\u7ec8\u6b62\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bc1\u660e\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u7a0b\u5e8f\u957f\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "result": "LLM\u5728\u7ec8\u6b62\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff0cGPT-5\u548cClaude Sonnet-4.5\u6392\u540d\u63a5\u8fd1SV-Comp 2025\u4e2d\u6700\u4f73\u4e13\u7528\u5de5\u5177\uff1b\u4f46\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u65e0\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u6709\u6548\u7ec8\u6b62\u6027\u8bc1\u660e\uff08witness\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u7a0b\u5e8f\u957f\u5ea6\u589e\u957f\u660e\u663e\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9\u4e0d\u53ef\u5224\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5982\u7ec8\u6b62\u6027\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u7528\u7ea7\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u4e0d\u80fd\u66ff\u4ee3\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5de5\u5177\uff1b\u5176\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff08\u5982\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8bc1\u660e\u3001\u89c4\u6a21\u654f\u611f\uff09\u6307\u660e\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

While Neural Theorem Proving (NTP) has achieved significant success in mathematical competitions, demonstrating the potential of machine learning approaches to formal reasoning, its application to program verification--particularly VC proving--remains largely unexplored. Despite existing work on annotation synthesis and verification-related theorem proving, no benchmark has specifically targeted this fundamental bottleneck: automated VC proving. This work introduces Neural Theorem Proving for Verification Conditions (NTP4VC), presenting the first real-world multi-language benchmark for this task. From real-world projects such as Linux and Contiki-OS kernel, our benchmark leverages industrial pipelines (Why3 and Frama-C) to generate semantically equivalent test cases across formal languages of Isabelle, Lean, and Rocq.

Traditional dimensionality reduction techniques generate static 2D or 3D embeddings that provide limited interpretability and do not offer a mechanism to leverage the analyst's intuition during exploration. To address this gap, we propose Interactive Project-Based Clustering (IPBC), a framework that reframes clustering as an iterative human-guided visual analysis process. IPBC integrates a nonlinear projection module with a feedback loop that allows users to modify the embedding by adjusting viewing angles and supplying simple constraints such as must-link or cannot-link relationships. These constraints reshape the objective of the projection model, gradually pulling semantically related points closer together and pushing unrelated points further apart. As the projection becomes more structured and expressive through user interaction, a conventional clustering algorithm operating on the optimized 2D layout can more reliably identify distinct groups.

However, large-angle redirection is inherently ill-posed: a monocular video captures only a narrow spatio-temporal view of a dynamic 3D scene, providing highly partial observations of the underlying 4D world. The key challenge is therefore to recover a complete and coherent representation from this limited input, with consistent geometry and motion. While recent diffusion-based methods achieve impressive results, they often break down under large-angle viewpoint changes far from the original trajectory, where missing visual grounding leads to severe geometric ambiguity and temporal inconsistency. To address this, we present FreeOrbit4D, an effective training-free framework that tackles this geometric ambiguity by recovering a geometry-complete 4D proxy as structural grounding for video generation. We obtain this proxy by decoupling foreground and background reconstructions: we unproject the monocular video into a static background and geometry-incomplete foreground point clouds in a unified global space, then leverage an object-centric multi-view diffusion model to synthesize multi-view images and reconstruct geometry-complete foreground point clouds in canonical object space. By aligning the canonical foreground point cloud to the global scene space via dense pixel-synchronized 3D--3D correspondences and projecting the geometry-complete 4D proxy onto target camera viewpoints, we provide geometric scaffolds that guide a conditional video diffusion model. Extensive experiments show that FreeOrbit4D produces more faithful redirected videos under challenging large-angle trajectories, and our geometry-complete 4D proxy further opens a potential avenue for practical applications such as edit propagation and 4D data generation.

Submitted to Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization", "summary": "Soft robotic grippers are essential for grasping delicate, geometrically complex objects in manufacturing, healthcare and agriculture. However, existing grippers struggle to grasp feature-rich objects with high topological variability, including gears with sharp tooth profiles on automotive assembly lines, corals with fragile protrusions, or vegetables with irregular branching structures like broccoli. Unlike simple geometric primitives such as cubes or spheres, feature-rich objects lack a clear \"optimal\" contact surface, making them both difficult to grasp and susceptible to damage when grasped by existing gripper designs. Safe handling of such objects therefore requires specialized soft grippers whose morphology is tailored to the object's features. Topology optimization offers a promising approach for producing specialized grippers, but its utility is limited by the requirement for pre-defined load cases. For soft grippers interacting with feature-rich objects, these loads arise from hundreds of unpredictable gripper-object contact forces during grasping and are unknown a priori. To address this problem, we introduce SimTO, a framework that enables high-resolution topology optimization by automatically extracting load cases from a contact-based physics simulator, eliminating the need for manual load specification. Given an arbitrary feature-rich object, SimTO produces highly customized soft grippers with fine-grained morphological features tailored to the object geometry.

Through extensive experiments involving three state-of-the-art LLM-based recommenders (GPT-4, LLaMA-3.1, and P5) across three domains (movies, books, and restaurants), and rigorous evaluation by 12 domain experts using 847 recommendation scenarios, we demonstrate that \\framework{} reveals critical quality dimensions invisible to traditional metrics. Our results show that while GPT-4 achieves superior explanation quality (4.21/5.0) and interaction naturalness (4.35/5.0), it exhibits a significant popularity bias (Gini coefficient 0.73) compared to traditional collaborative filtering (0.58).

Being the new paradigm of neural rendering, Gaussian Splatting has been investigated in many applications, with the main effort in extending its representation, improving its optimization process, and accelerating its speed. However, one orthogonal, much needed, but under-explored area is data uncertainty. In standard 4D Gaussian Splatting, data uncertainty can manifest as view sparsity, missing frames, camera asynchronization, etc. So far, there has been little research to holistically incorporating various types of data uncertainty under a single framework. To this end, we propose Graphical X Splatting, or GraphiXS, a new probabilistic framework that considers multiple types of data uncertainty, aiming for a fundamental augmentation of the current 4D Gaussian Splatting paradigm into a probabilistic setting. GraphiXS is general and can be instantiated with a range of primitives, e.g. Gaussians, Student's-t. Furthermore, GraphiXS can be used to `upgrade' existing methods to accommodate data uncertainty. Through exhaustive evaluation and comparison, we demonstrate that GraphiXS can systematically model various uncertainties in data, outperform existing methods in many settings where data are missing or polluted in space and time, and therefore is a major generalization of the current 4D Gaussian Splatting research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faGraphiXS\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6982\u7387\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u9ad8\u65af\u70b9\u7ed8\uff08Gaussian Splatting\uff09\u4e2d\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff08\u5982\u89c6\u89d2\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u5e27\u7f3a\u5931\u3001\u76f8\u673a\u4e0d\u540c\u6b65\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u5206\u5e03\u5047\u8bbe\uff08\u5982\u9ad8\u65af\u3001t\u5206\u5e03\uff09\uff0c\u53ef\u5347\u7ea7\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7f3a\u5931/\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67094D\u9ad8\u65af\u70b9\u7ed8\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff08\u5982\u89c6\u56fe\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u5e27\u7f3a\u5931\u3001\u76f8\u673a\u4e0d\u540c\u6b65\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u91cd\u8981\u4f46\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGraphical X Splatting\uff08GraphiXS\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u6982\u7387\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u5206\u5e03\u539f\u8bed\uff08\u5982\u9ad8\u65af\u3001Student's-t\uff09\uff0c\u53ef\u5d4c\u5165\u5e76\u5347\u7ea7\u73b0\u6709\u9ad8\u65af\u70b9\u7ed8\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\u591a\u7c7b\u578b\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eGraphiXS\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u5931\u6216\u53d7\u6c61\u67d3\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "GraphiXS\u662f\u5bf9\u5f53\u524d4D\u9ad8\u65af\u70b9\u7ed8\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u6839\u672c\u6027\u62d3\u5c55\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u63a8\u8fdb\u81f3\u6982\u7387\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u65b0\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u901a\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

However, little attention has been given to the possibility that such models could be exploited to produce harmful research by repurposing open science artefacts for malicious ends. We fill the gap by introducing an end-to-end pipeline that first bypasses LLM safeguards through persuasion-based jailbreaking, then reinterprets NLP papers to identify and repurpose their artefacts (datasets, methods, and tools) by exploiting their vulnerabilities, and finally assesses the safety of these proposals using our evaluation framework across three dimensions: harmfulness, feasibility of misuse, and soundness of technicality. Overall, our findings demonstrate that LLMs can generate harmful proposals by repurposing ethically designed open artefacts; however, we find that LLMs acting as evaluators strongly disagree with one another on evaluation outcomes: GPT-4.1 assigns higher scores (indicating greater potential harms, higher soundness and feasibility of misuse), Gemini-2.5-pro is markedly stricter, and Grok-3 falls between these extremes.

However, existing forecasting models are typically guided by channel-agnostic loss functions like MSE, which apply a uniform metric across all channels. This often leads to fail to capture channel-specific dynamics such as sharp fluctuations or trend shifts. To address this, we propose a Channel-wise Perceptual Loss (CP Loss). Its core idea is to learn a unique perceptual space for each channel that is adapted to its characteristics, and to compute the loss within this space. Specifically, we first design a learnable channel-wise filter that decomposes the raw signal into disentangled multi-scale representations, which form the basis of our perceptual space. Crucially, the filter is optimized jointly with the main forecasting model, ensuring that the learned perceptual space is explicitly oriented towards the prediction task. Finally, losses are calculated within these perception spaces to optimize the model.

Conformal prediction (CP) is a powerful distribution-free framework for constructing statistically valid prediction intervals. However, standard applications in segmentation often ignore anatomical context, resulting in fragmented, spatially incoherent, and over-segmented prediction sets that limit clinical utility. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes Random-Walk Conformal Prediction (RW-CP), a model-agnostic framework which can be added on top of any segmentation method. RW-CP enforces spatial coherence to generate anatomically valid sets. Our method constructs a k-nearest neighbour graph from pre-trained vision foundation model features and applies a random walk to diffuse uncertainty. The random walk diffusion regularizes the non-conformity scores, making the prediction sets less sensitive to the conformal calibration parameter $\u03bb$, ensuring more stable and continuous anatomical boundaries. RW-CP maintains rigorous marginal coverage while significantly improving segmentation quality. Evaluations on multi-modal public datasets show improvements of up to $35.4\\%$ compared to standard CP baselines, given an allowable error rate of $\u03b1=0.1$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aRandom-Walk Conformal Prediction\uff08RW-CP\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7edf\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6e38\u8d70\u6269\u6563\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5272\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\uff08CP\uff09\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u5ffd\u7565\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0d\u8fde\u8d2f\u3001\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u53d7\u9650\uff1b\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u517c\u987e\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e0e\u89e3\u5256\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684RW-CP\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\u6784\u5efak\u8fd1\u90bb\u56fe\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u968f\u673a\u6e38\u8d70\u5bf9\u975e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5206\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u6269\u6563\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u751f\u6210\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u3001\u89e3\u5256\u5408\u7406\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u8fb9\u9645\u8986\u76d6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cRW-CP\u76f8\u8f83\u6807\u51c6CP\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u5141\u8bb8\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u03b1=0.1\u4e0b\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe35.4%\uff0c\u4e14\u9884\u6d4b\u8fb9\u754c\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u8fde\u7eed\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e25\u683c\u6210\u7acb\u3002", "conclusion": "RW-CP\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u89e3\u5256\u5408\u7406\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u4fe1\u533b\u5b66AI\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u3001\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u969c\u5f3a\u3001\u89e3\u5256\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Flocking - coordinated motion through cohesion, alignment, and separation - traditionally assumes uniform desired inter-agent distances. Many practical applications demand greater flexibility, as the diversity of types and configurations grows with the popularity of multi-agent systems in society. Moreover, agents often operate without guarantees of trust or secure communication. Motivated by these challenges we update well-established frameworks by relaxing this assumption of shared inter-agent distances and constraints. Through a new form of constrained collective potential function, we introduce a solution that permits negotiation of these parameters. In the spirit of the traditional flocking control canon, this negotiation is achieved purely through local observations and does not require any global information or inter-agent communication. The approach is robust to semi-trust scenarios, where neighbouring agents pursue conflicting goals.

Existing methods often overlook this modality-specific uncertainty, leading to ineffective feature fusion. Furthermore, they fail to leverage rich similarity patterns among users and items to refine representations and their corresponding uncertainty estimates. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, Similarity Propagation-enhanced Uncertainty for Multimodal Recommendation (SPUMR). SPUMR explicitly models and mitigates uncertainty by first constructing the Modality Similarity Graph and the Collaborative Similarity Graph to refine representations from both content and behavioral perspectives. The Uncertainty-aware Preference Aggregation module then adaptively fuses the refined multimodal features, assigning greater weight to more reliable modalities.

Unlike traditional approaches, FROST leverages attention weights to prune uncritical reasoning paths, yielding shorter and more reliable reasoning trajectories. Methodologically, we introduce the concept of reasoning outliers and design an attention-based mechanism to remove them. Theoretically, FROST preserves and enhances the model's reasoning capacity while eliminating outliers at the sentence level. Empirically, we validate FROST on four benchmarks using two strong reasoning models (Phi-4-Reasoning and GPT-OSS-20B), outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as TALE and ThinkLess. Notably, FROST achieves an average 69.68% reduction in token usage and a 26.70% improvement in accuracy over the base model. Furthermore, in evaluations of attention outlier metrics, FROST reduces the maximum infinity norm by 15.97% and the average kurtosis by 91.09% compared to the base model.

We propose UA-3DTalk, Uncertainty-Aware 3D Emotional Talking Face Synthesis with emotion prior distillation, which has three core modules: the Prior Extraction module disentangles audio into content-synchronized features for alignment and person-specific complementary features for individualization; the Emotion Distillation module introduces a multi-modal attention-weighted fusion mechanism and 4D Gaussian encoding with multi-resolution code-books, enabling fine-grained audio emotion extraction and precise control of emotional micro-expressions; the Uncertainty-based Deformation deploys uncertainty blocks to estimate view-specific aleatoric (input noise) and epistemic (model parameters) uncertainty, realizing adaptive multi-view fusion and incorporating a multi-head decoder for Gaussian primitive optimization to mitigate the limitations of uniform-weight fusion. Extensive experiments on regular and emotional datasets show UA-3DTalk outperforms state-of-the-art methods like DEGSTalk and EDTalk by 5.2% in E-FID for emotion alignment, 3.1% in SyncC for lip synchronization, and 0.015 in LPIPS for rendering quality.

A Systematic Study of Hybrid CNN-RNN Architectures for Multi-Label ECG Classification", "comment": "17 pages, 10 figures", "summary": "Accurate multi-label classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals remains challenging due to the coexistence of multiple cardiac conditions, pronounced class imbalance, and long-range temporal dependencies in multi-lead recordings. Although recent studies increasingly rely on deep and stacked recurrent architectures, the necessity and clinical justification of such architectural complexity have not been rigorously examined. In this work, we perform a systematic comparative evaluation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) combined with multiple recurrent configurations, including LSTM, GRU, Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and their stacked variants, for multi-label ECG classification on the PTB-XL dataset comprising 23 diagnostic categories. The CNN component serves as a morphology-driven baseline, while recurrent layers are progressively integrated to assess their contribution to temporal modeling and generalization performance. Experimental results indicate that a CNN integrated with a single BiLSTM layer achieves the most favorable trade-off between predictive performance and model complexity. This configuration attains superior Hamming loss (0.0338), macro-AUPRC (0.4715), micro-F1 score (0.6979), and subset accuracy (0.5723) compared with deeper recurrent combinations. Although stacked recurrent models occasionally improve recall for specific rare classes, our results provide empirical evidence that increasing recurrent depth yields diminishing returns and may degrade generalization due to reduced precision and overfitting. These findings suggest that architectural alignment with the intrinsic temporal structure of ECG signals, rather than increased recurrent depth, is a key determinant of robust performance and clinically relevant deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86CNN\u4e0e\u591a\u79cdRNN\u7ed3\u6784\uff08LSTM\u3001GRU\u3001BiLSTM\u53ca\u5176\u5806\u53e0\u53d8\u4f53\uff09\u5728PTB-XL\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0CNN+\u5355\u5c42BiLSTM\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f73\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u66f4\u6df1\u7684RNN\u7ed3\u6784\u6536\u76ca\u9012\u51cf\u4e14\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u91c7\u7528\u6df1\u5c42/\u5806\u53e0\u5faa\u73af\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u5408\u7406\u6027\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e25\u683c\u68c0\u9a8c\uff1bECG\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u7c7b\u9762\u4e34\u591a\u75c5\u5171\u5b58\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u957f\u7a0b\u65f6\u5e8f\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5728PTB-XL\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0823\u7c7b\u8bca\u65ad\uff09\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ee5CNN\u4e3a\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u5f15\u5165\u4e0d\u540cRNN\u7ed3\u6784\uff08LSTM\u3001GRU\u3001BiLSTM\u53ca\u5806\u53e0\u7248\u672c\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5bf9\u65f6\u5e8f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "CNN+\u5355\u5c42BiLSTM\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f18\u7efc\u5408\u6307\u6807\uff1aHamming\u635f\u59310.0338\u3001macro-AUPRC 0.4715\u3001micro-F1 0.6979\u3001\u5b50\u96c6\u51c6\u786e\u73870.5723\uff1b\u5806\u53e0RNN\u4ec5\u5728\u4e2a\u522b\u7a00\u6709\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u53ec\u56de\uff0c\u4f46\u6574\u4f53\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u51cf\u5f31\u3002", "conclusion": "ECG\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5728\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u4fe1\u53f7\u5185\u5728\u65f6\u5e8f\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5355\u7eaf\u589e\u52a0RNN\u6df1\u5ea6\uff1bCNN+\u5355\u5c42BiLSTM\u66f4\u9002\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

It considers a 2D grid-based storage for uniform-sized loads (e.g., containers, pallets, or totes), which are moved by a robot (or other manipulator) along a collision-free path in the grid. The loads are labeled (i.e., unique) and must be stored in a given sequence, and later be retrieved in a different sequence -- an operational pattern that arises in logistics applications, such as last-mile distribution centers and shipyards. The objective is to minimize the load relocations to ensure efficient retrieval. A previous result guarantees a zero-relocation solution for known storage and retrieval sequences, even for storage at full capacity, provided that the side of the grid through which loads are stored/retrieved is at least 3 cells wide. However, in practice, the retrieval sequence can change after the storage phase. To address such uncertainty, this work investigates \\emph{$k$-bounded perturbations} during retrieval, under which any two loads may depart out of order if they are originally at most $k$ positions apart. We prove that a $\u0398(k)$ grid width is necessary and sufficient for eliminating relocations at maximum capacity. We also provide an efficient solver for computing a storage arrangement that is robust to such perturbations. To address the higher-uncertainty case where perturbations exceed $k$, a strategy is introduced to effectively minimize relocations. Extensive experiments show that, for $k$ up to half the grid width, the proposed storage-retrieval framework essentially eliminates relocations. For $k$ values up to the full grid width, relocations are reduced by $50\\%+$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4ed3\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd0\u884c\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9488\u5bf92D\u7f51\u683c\u5b58\u50a8\u4e2d\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5e8f\u5217\u53d8\u52a8\uff08k-\u6709\u754c\u6270\u52a8\uff09\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u0398(k)\u7f51\u683c\u5bbd\u5ea6\u53ef\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6ee1\u8f7d\u96f6\u91cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u9c81\u68d2\u5b58\u50a8\u65b9\u6848\u53ca\u9ad8\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u91cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u9645\u7269\u6d41\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff08\u5982\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u516c\u91cc\u914d\u9001\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3001\u8239\u5382\uff09\uff0c\u5b58\u50a8\u540e retrieval \u5e8f\u5217\u53ef\u80fd\u53d1\u751f\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u539f\u6709\u96f6\u91cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6848\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u9700\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165k-\u6709\u754c\u6270\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u523b\u753b retrieval \u5e8f\u5217\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u6240\u9700\u6700\u5c0f\u7f51\u683c\u5bbd\u5ea6\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9c81\u68d2\u5b58\u50a8\u5b89\u6392\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u91cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u0398(k)\u7f51\u683c\u5bbd\u5ea6\u662f\u6ee1\u8f7d\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u91cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u5145\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5f53k\u8fbe\u534a\u5bbd\u65f6\u57fa\u672c\u6d88\u9664\u91cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0ck\u8fbe\u5168\u5bbd\u65f6\u91cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u51cf\u5c1150%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u53ef\u63a7\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u9c81\u68d2\u4ed3\u50a8\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u91cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4ed3\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

Standard collaborative filtering algorithms are structurally blind to these hard limits, frequently suggesting bundles that fail to meet specific total daily energy expenditure and macronutrient balance requirements. To address this disconnect, this paper introduces a Physics-Informed Neuro-Symbolic Recommender System that integrates nutritional science directly into the recommendation pipeline via a dual-layer architecture. The framework begins by constructing a semantic knowledge graph using sentence-level encoders to strictly align commercial products with authoritative nutritional data. During the training phase, an implicit physics regularizer applies a differentiable thermodynamic loss function, ensuring that learned latent embeddings reflect nutritional plausibility rather than simple popularity. Subsequently, during the inference phase, an explicit physics optimizer employs simulated annealing and elastic quantity optimization to generate discrete grocery bundles that strictly adhere to the user's protein and caloric targets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c06\u8425\u517b\u79d1\u5b66\u5d4c\u5165\u7535\u5546\u63a8\u8350\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u3001\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u7528\u6237\u80fd\u91cf\u4e0e\u5b8f\u91cf\u8425\u517b\u7d20\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u98df\u54c1\u7ec4\u5408\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7535\u5546\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u5ffd\u89c6\u4eba\u4f53\u5065\u5eb7\u6240\u9700\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u751f\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u5982\u6bcf\u65e5\u80fd\u91cf\u6d88\u8017\u548c\u5b8f\u91cf\u8425\u517b\u7d20\u5e73\u8861\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u8350\u7ed3\u679c\u8425\u517b\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u53e5\u5b50\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u8425\u517b\u8bed\u4e49\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff1b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5fae\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9690\u5f0f\u7269\u7406\u6b63\u5219\u9879\uff1b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u62df\u9000\u706b\u4e0e\u5f39\u6027\u6570\u91cf\u4f18\u5316\u751f\u6210\u6ee1\u8db3\u8425\u517b\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u5546\u54c1\u7ec4\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u4e25\u683c\u7b26\u5408\u7528\u6237\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u4e0e\u70ed\u91cf\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u98df\u54c1\u63a8\u8350\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u8425\u517b\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u89c4\u5f8b\uff08\u8425\u517b\u79d1\u5b66\uff09\u663e\u5f0f\u878d\u5165\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u8865\u4f20\u7edf\u534f\u540c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5728\u5065\u5eb7\u7ea6\u675f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0a\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u8425\u517b\u7535\u5546\u63a8\u8350\u3002"}}

Using time-of-flight ranging between wireless nodes, our method eliminates the need for external cameras, enabling robust operation in uncontrolled and outdoor environments. Unlike traditional optical or inertial systems, our approach is shape-invariant and resilient to environmental constraints such as lighting and magnetic interference. At the core of our system is Wild-Poser (WiP for short), a compact, real-time Transformer-based architecture that directly predicts 3D joint positions from noisy or corrupted PWD measurements, which can later be used for joint rotation reconstruction via learned methods. WiP generalizes across subjects of varying morphologies, including non-human species, without requiring individual body measurements or shape fitting. Operating in real time, WiP achieves low joint position error and demonstrates accurate 3D motion reconstruction for both human and animal subjects in-the-wild. Our empirical analysis highlights its potential for scalable, low-cost, and general purpose motion capture in real-world settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8eab\u4f53\u4f69\u6234\u7684\u8d85\u5bbd\u5e26\uff08UWB\uff09\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6d4b\u5f97\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6210\u5bf9\u8ddd\u79bb\uff08PWD\uff09\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u8eab3D\u8fd0\u52a8\u6355\u6349\u7684\u65b0\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u5b9e\u65f6Transformer\u6a21\u578bWild-Poser\uff08WiP\uff09\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u8de8\u4f53\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u6297\u73af\u5883\u5e72\u6270\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u8bbe\u5907\u7b49\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u5149\u5b66\u6216\u60ef\u6027\u52a8\u6355\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u65e0\u63a7/\u6237\u5916\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5149\u7167\u3001\u78c1\u573a\u3001\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u8bbe\u5907\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8ffd\u6c42\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u901a\u7528\u7684\u91ce\u5916\u8fd0\u52a8\u6355\u6349\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eUWB\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u83b7\u53d6\u7a00\u758fPWD\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5b9e\u65f6Transformer\u67b6\u6784Wild-Poser\uff08WiP\uff09\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u542b\u566aPWD\u9884\u6d4b3D\u5173\u8282\u70b9\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u91cd\u5efa\u5173\u8282\u65cb\u8f6c\uff1b\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u4f53\u578b\uff08\u542b\u975e\u4eba\u7269\u79cd\uff09\u96f6\u6821\u51c6\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "result": "WiP\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u5173\u8282\u70b9\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u5b9e\u65f63D\u8fd0\u52a8\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e\u52a8\u7269\u4e3b\u4f53\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e2a\u4f53\u4f53\u578b\u6d4b\u91cf\u6216\u62df\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u901a\u7528\u578b\u91ce\u5916\u8fd0\u52a8\u6355\u6349\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u52a8\u6355\u6280\u672f\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Such setups overlook the multi-dimensional and multi-modal nature of conversational quality, which encompasses semantic coherence, audio naturalness, speaker consistency, emotion alignment, and turn-taking behavior. Moreover, they are fundamentally mismatched with duplex spoken dialogue systems that generate responses incrementally, where agents must make decisions based on partial utterances. We address these limitations with the first multi-reward RLAIF framework for SDS, combining semantic, audio-quality, and emotion-consistency rewards. To align utterance-level preferences with incremental, blockwise decoding in duplex models, we apply turn-level preference sampling and aggregate per-block log-probabilities within a single DPO objective. We present the first systematic study of preference learning for improving SDS quality in both multi-turn Chain-of-Thought and blockwise duplex models, and release a multi-reward DPO dataset to support reproducible research. Experiments show that single-reward RLAIF selectively improves its targeted metric, while joint multi-reward training yields consistent gains across semantic quality and audio naturalness.

Existing methods for improving the function call capabilities of LLMs rely on data obtained either through manual annotation or automated generation by models, and use this data to finetune the LLMs. However, these methods often lack targeted design and are constrained by fixed patterns and data distributions, which limits their effectiveness in enhancing the generalization and robustness of function call LLMs. To address this limitation, we propose a novel adversarial data augmentation method that employs reinforcement learning to systematically identify and target the weaknesses of function call LLMs. Our training framework introduces a query model trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to generate adversarial queries that are specifically designed to challenge function call (FC) models. This approach adopts a zero sum game formulation, where the query model and the FC model engage in iterative alternating training. Overall, our method advances the development of more robust FC models and provides a systematic way to identify and correct weaknesses in the ability of LLMs to interact with external tools.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u67e5\u8be2\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u51fd\u6570\u8c03\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u96f6\u548c\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u53d1\u73b0\u5e76\u5f25\u8865\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51fd\u6570\u8c03\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u7684\u5f31\u70b9\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u51fd\u6570\u8c03\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6216\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2aRL\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u4e13\u95e8\u6311\u6218\u51fd\u6570\u8c03\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u4e8c\u8005\u4ee5\u96f6\u548c\u535a\u5f08\u65b9\u5f0f\u4ea4\u66ff\u8fed\u4ee3\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u4fee\u6b63\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5de5\u5177\u4ea4\u4e92\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u7684\u5f31\u70b9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u51fd\u6570\u8c03\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u8c03\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u6539\u8fdbLLM\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, evaluation and deployment is challenged by the lack of dedicated virtual testbeds. The Immersive Framework for Advanced Nuclear (iFAN) ecosystem is developed, a comprehensive digital twin framework with a realistic 3D environment with physics-based simulations. The iFAN ecosystem serves as a high-fidelity virtual testbed for plant operation, cybersecurity, physical security, and robotic operation, as it provides real-time data exchange for pre-deployment verification.

Naturally, RS place primary emphasis on the quality of the Top-$K$ results rather than performance across the entire item set. However, estimating Top-$K$ accuracy (e.g., Precision@$K$, Recall@$K$) requires determining the ranking positions of items, which imposes substantial computational overhead and poses significant challenges for optimization. In addition, RS often suffer from distribution shifts due to evolving user preferences or data biases, further complicating the task.\n  To address these issues, we propose Talos, a loss function that is specifically designed to optimize the Talos recommendation accuracy. Talos leverages a quantile technique that replaces the complex ranking-dependent operations into simpler comparisons between predicted scores and learned score thresholds. We further develop a sampling-based regression algorithm for efficient and accurate threshold estimation, and introduce a constraint term to maintain optimization stability by preventing score inflation. Additionally, we incorporate a tailored surrogate function to address discontinuity and enhance robustness against distribution shifts. Comprehensive theoretical analyzes and empirical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, convergence, and distributional robustness of Talos.

While longer sequences provide more context, we observe that increasing the maximum input sequence length in existing CTR models paradoxically degrades performance for short-sequence users due to attention polarization and length imbalance in training data. To address this, we propose LAIN(Length-Adaptive Interest Network), a plug-and-play framework that explicitly incorporates sequence length as a conditioning signal to balance long- and short-sequence modeling. LAIN consists of three lightweight components: a Spectral Length Encoder that maps length into continuous representations, Length-Conditioned Prompting that injects global contextual cues into both long- and short-term behavior branches, and Length-Modulated Attention that adaptively adjusts attention sharpness based on sequence length.

However, existing approaches face three main obstacles: controllability, scalability, and efficiency. End-to-end scene generation models have been limited by data scarcity. While object-centric generation approaches rely on fixed resolution representations, degrading fidelity for larger scenes. Training-free approaches, while flexible, are often slow and computationally expensive at inference time. We present NuiWorld, a framework that attempts to address these challenges. To overcome data scarcity, we propose a generative bootstrapping strategy that starts from a few input images. Leveraging recent 3D reconstruction and expandable scene generation techniques, we synthesize scenes of varying sizes and layouts, producing enough data to train an end-to-end model. Furthermore, our framework enables controllability through pseudo sketch labels, and demonstrates a degree of generalization to previously unseen sketches. Our approach represents scenes as a collection of variable scene chunks, which are compressed into a flattened vector-set representation. This significantly reduces the token length for large scenes, enabling consistent geometric fidelity across scenes sizes while improving training and inference efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "NuiWorld \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u4e16\u754c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\u7f13\u89e3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53ef\u53d8\u573a\u666f\u5757\u548c\u6241\u5e73\u5316\u5411\u91cf\u96c6\u8868\u793a\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f2a\u8349\u56fe\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e16\u754c\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u5dee\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e09\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u56fa\u5b9a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8868\u793a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5927\u573a\u666f\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7075\u6d3b\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u6162\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5f15\u5bfc\uff08generative bootstrapping\uff09\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ece\u5c11\u91cf\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u7ed3\u54083D\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\u5408\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u4f2a\u8349\u56fe\u6807\u7b7e\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u63a7\u751f\u6210\uff1b\u5c06\u573a\u666f\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u53ef\u53d8\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u573a\u666f\u5757\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u6241\u5e73\u5316\u5411\u91cf\u96c6\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u7f29\u77edtoken\u957f\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5927\u4e2d\u5c0f\u5404\u7c7b\u573a\u666f\u51e0\u4f55\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u652f\u6301\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u4f2a\u8349\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u6cdb\u5316\u751f\u6210\uff1b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u4e0e\u826f\u597d\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "NuiWorld \u6709\u6548\u534f\u540c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e16\u754c\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

To replicate this capability, we introduce Tactile Memory with Soft Robot (TaMeSo-bot), a system that integrates a soft wrist with tactile retrieval-based control to enable safe and robust manipulation. The soft wrist allows safe contact exploration during data collection, while tactile memory reuses past demonstrations via retrieval for flexible adaptation to unseen scenarios. The core of this system is the Masked Tactile Trajectory Transformer (MAT$^\\text{3}$), which jointly models spatiotemporal interactions between robot actions, distributed tactile feedback, force-torque measurements, and proprioceptive signals. Through masked-token prediction, MAT$^\\text{3}$ learns rich spatiotemporal representations by inferring missing sensory information from context, autonomously extracting task-relevant features without explicit subtask segmentation.

Yet real-world recommendation signals extend far beyond these modalities. To reflect this, we formalize recommendation features into four modalities: text, images, categorical features, and numerical attributes, and highlight the unique challenges this heterogeneity poses for LLMs in understanding multimodal information. In particular, these challenges arise not only across modalities but also within them, as attributes such as price, rating, and time may all be numeric yet carry distinct semantic meanings. Beyond this intra-modality ambiguity, another major challenge is the nested structure of recommendation signals, where user histories are sequences of items, each associated with multiple attributes. To address these challenges, we propose UniRec, a unified multimodal encoder for LLM-based recommendation. UniRec first employs modality-specific encoders to produce consistent embeddings across heterogeneous signals. It then adopts a triplet representation, comprising attribute name, type, and value, to separate schema from raw inputs and preserve semantic distinctions. Finally, a hierarchical Q-Former models the nested structure of user interactions while maintaining their layered organization. Across multiple real-world benchmarks, UniRec outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal and LLM-based recommenders by up to 15%, and extensive ablation studies further validate the contributions of each component.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faUniRec\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u6587\u672c\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u6570\u503c\u5c5e\u6027\u56db\u7c7b\u5f02\u6784\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u6001\u5185\u8bed\u4e49\u6b67\u4e49\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u5d4c\u5957\u7ed3\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u63a8\u8350\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdc\u8d85\u6587\u672c\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u7c7b\u522b\u3001\u6570\u503c\u7b49\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e0e\u6a21\u6001\u5185\uff08\u5982\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u6570\u503c\uff09\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7528\u6237\u5386\u53f2\u7684\u5d4c\u5957\u5e8f\u5217\u7ed3\u6784\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUniRec\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u6a21\u6001\u4e13\u7528\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u5d4c\u5165\uff1b2\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u2018\u5c5e\u6027\u540d-\u7c7b\u578b-\u503c\u2019\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u8868\u793a\u4ee5\u89e3\u8026schema\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u8f93\u5165\u3001\u4fdd\u7559\u8bed\u4e49\u533a\u5206\uff1b3\uff09\u5206\u5c42Q-Former\u5efa\u6a21\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u5d4c\u5957\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cUniRec\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u53caLLM\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe15%\uff0c\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5404\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "UniRec\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\u5f02\u6784\u6a21\u6001\u4e0e\u5d4c\u5957\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u8350\u4fe1\u53f7\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

The government places a strong emphasis on preserving and promoting the Bahnaric language by making it accessible online and encouraging communication across generations. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence, such as Neural Machine Translation (NMT), have brought about a transformation in translation by improving accuracy and fluency. This, in turn, contributes to the revival of the language through educational efforts, communication, and documentation. Specifically, NMT is pivotal in enhancing accessibility for Bahnaric speakers, making information and content more readily available. Nevertheless, the translation of Vietnamese into Bahnaric faces practical challenges due to resource constraints, especially given the limited resources available for the Bahnaric language. To address this, we employ state-of-the-art techniques in NMT along with two augmentation strategies for domain-specific Vietnamese-Bahnaric translation task.

During encoding, PixSearch emits <search> tokens to trigger retrieval, selects query modalities (text, image, or region), and generates pixel-level masks that directly serve as visual queries, eliminating the reliance on modular pipelines (detectors, segmenters, captioners, etc.). A two-stage supervised fine-tuning regimen with search-interleaved supervision teaches retrieval timing and query selection while preserving segmentation ability. On egocentric and entity-centric VQA benchmarks, PixSearch substantially improves factual consistency and generalization, yielding a 19.7% relative gain in accuracy on CRAG-MM compared to whole image retrieval, while retaining competitive reasoning performance on various VQA and text-only QA tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "PixSearch\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165<search>\u6807\u8bb0\u3001\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u67e5\u8be2\uff08\u6587\u672c/\u56fe\u50cf/\u533a\u57df\uff09\u53ca\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u63a9\u7801\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u533a\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347VQA\u4e2d\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\uff08VQA\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u878d\u5408\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u4e8b\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff1b\u5df2\u6709MM-RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4f55\u65f6\u3001\u5982\u4f55\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPixSearch\uff1a\u9996\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5206\u6bb5\u5f0f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff08LMM\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u7f16\u7801\u9636\u6bb5\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210<search>\u6807\u8bb0\u4ee5\u89e6\u53d1\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u67e5\u8be2\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u8f93\u51fa\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u63a9\u7801\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u67e5\u8be2\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u4ea4\u9519\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u68c0\u7d22\u65f6\u673a\u3001\u67e5\u8be2\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u5206\u5272\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728CRAG-MM\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u76f8\u8f83\u5168\u56fe\u68c0\u7d22\u63d0\u534719.7%\u76f8\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u5404\u7c7bVQA\u548c\u7eaf\u6587\u672cQA\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "PixSearch\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u533a\u57df\u7ea7\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u6446\u8131\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u95ee\u7b54\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Although existing methods are already competitive in terms of recommendation performance, directly inheriting the autoregressive decoding paradigm from language models still suffers from three key limitations: (1) autoregressive decoding struggles to jointly capture global dependencies among the multi-dimensional features associated with different positions of SID; (2) using a unified, fixed decoding path for the same item implicitly assumes that all users attend to item attributes in the same order; (3) autoregressive decoding is inefficient at inference time and struggles to meet real-time requirements. To tackle these challenges, we propose MDGR, a Masked Diffusion Generative Recommendation framework that reshapes the GR pipeline from three perspectives: codebook, training, and inference. (1) We adopt a parallel codebook to provide a structural foundation for diffusion-based GR. (2) During training, we adaptively construct masking supervision signals along both the temporal and sample dimensions. (3) During inference, we develop a warm-up-based two-stage parallel decoding strategy for efficient generation of SIDs. Extensive experiments on multiple public and industrial-scale datasets show that MDGR outperforms ten state-of-the-art baselines by up to 10.78%.

Fundamentally, this constitutes a reasoning process composed of \\textit{hypothesis-verification cycles}, requiring models to possess both geospatial reasoning capabilities and the ability to verify evidence against geographic facts. Existing methods typically internalize location knowledge and reasoning patterns into static memory via supervised training or trajectory-based reinforcement fine-tuning. Consequently, these methods are prone to factual hallucinations and generalization bottlenecks in open-world settings or scenarios requiring dynamic knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose a Hierarchical Localization Agent, called LocationAgent. Our core philosophy is to retain hierarchical reasoning logic within the model while offloading the verification of geographic evidence to external tools. To implement hierarchical reasoning, we design the RER architecture (Reasoner-Executor-Recorder), which employs role separation and context compression to prevent the drifting problem in multi-step reasoning. For evidence verification, we construct a suite of clue exploration tools that provide diverse evidence to support location reasoning. Furthermore, to address data leakage and the scarcity of Chinese data in existing datasets, we introduce CCL-Bench (China City Location Bench), an image geolocation benchmark encompassing various scene granularities and difficulty levels.

Behavioral evaluations reveal when models fail but offer limited insight into why failures arise at the representational level. We introduce Homomorphism Error (HE), a structural metric that quantifies deviations from approximate homomorphisms between the expression algebra and a model's hidden-state space. We instantiate HE for two compositional operators in SCAN-style tasks: modifier HE for unary composition and sequence HE for binary composition, measured by learning representation-level operators that predict composed representations from their parts. Across controlled experiments with small decoder-only Transformers, HE predicts out-of-distribution (OOD) compositional generalization under noise injection, achieving R^2 = 0.73 correlation between modifier HE and OOD accuracy. Ablations show that model depth has minimal effect on either HE or OOD accuracy, training data coverage exhibits threshold effects (insufficient coverage sharply increases HE and degrades OOD performance), and randomly inserted noise tokens systematically increase HE. Finally, we test if HE-regularized training improves OOD accuracy. Experiment shows that explicitly enforcing low modifier HE during training significantly reduces modifier HE (p = 1.1x10-4) and sequence HE (p = 0.001) and yields a statistically significant improvement in OOD accuracy (p = 0.023). Together, these results indicate the potential of HE to be both a diagnostic and an actionable training signal for improving compositional generalization.

Traditional solvers often suffer from high latency, while emerging learning-based approaches struggle to ensure deterministic feasibility. To bridge the gap from embodied to embedded intelligence, we propose a self-supervised framework incorporating a differentiable hard constraint projection layer for runtime assurance. To mitigate data scarcity, we construct a Global-Guided Artificial Potential Field (G-APF), which provides dense supervision signals without manual labeling. To enforce actuator limitations and geometric constraints efficiently, we employ an adaptive neural projection layer, which iteratively rectifies the coarse network output onto the feasible manifold. Extensive benchmarks on a test set of 20,000 scenarios demonstrate an 88.75\\% success rate, substantiating the enhanced operational safety. Closed-loop experiments in CARLA further validate the physical realizability of the planned paths under dynamic constraints. Furthermore, deployment verification on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX confirms an inference latency of 94 ms, showing real-time feasibility on resource-constrained embedded hardware. This framework offers a generalized paradigm for embedding physical laws into neural architectures, providing a viable direction for solving constrained optimization in mechatronics.

Proactively recommending academic papers that align with scholars' literature needs in the research process has become one of the crucial pathways to enhance research efficiency and stimulate innovative thinking. Current academic paper recommendation systems primarily focus on broad and coarse-grained suggestions based on general topic or field similarities. While these systems effectively identify related literature, they fall short in addressing scholars' more specific and fine-grained needs, such as locating papers that utilize particular research methods, or tackle distinct research tasks within the same topic. To meet the diverse and specific literature needs of scholars in the research process, this paper proposes a novel academic paper recommendation method. This approach embeds multidimensional information by integrating new types of fine-grained knowledge entities, title and abstract of document, and citation data. Recommendations are then generated by calculating the similarity between combined paper vectors. The proposed recommendation method was evaluated using the STM-KG dataset, a knowledge graph that incorporates scientific concepts derived from papers across ten distinct domains. The experimental results indicate that our method outperforms baseline models, achieving an average precision of 27.3% among the top 50 recommendations.

Then, a thorough evaluation framework is designed and executed to benchmark the susceptibility of various models to these conflicting multimodal inputs. Comprehensive experiments over 11 state-of-the-art VLMs reveal that these models are indeed vulnerable to misleading textual prompts, often overriding clear visual evidence in favor of the conflicting text, and show an average performance drop of over 48.2% after only one round of persuasive conversation.

The framework iterates through three stages: (1) a graph extraction phase with the graph builder agent, (2) a structural feedback phase in which a simulation agent diagnoses and explains structural defects, and (3) a logical feedback phase in which a semantic agent aligns semantics between flow logic and linguistic cues in the source text. Important feedback is prioritized and expressed in natural language, which is injected into subsequent prompts, enabling interpretable and controllable refinement.

Collapsing these uncertainties to a single point estimate can distort what is learned. We systematically study how uncertainty propagates through knowledge distillation across three representative model classes--linear regression, feed-forward neural networks, and large language models (LLMs)--and propose simple corrections. We distinguish inter-student uncertainty (variance across independently distilled students) from intra-student uncertainty (variance of a single student's predictive distribution), showing that standard single-response knowledge distillation suppresses intra-student variance while leaving substantial inter-student variability. To address these mismatches, we introduce two variance-aware strategies: averaging multiple teacher responses, which reduces noise at rate $O(1/k)$, and variance-weighting, which combines teacher and student estimates via inverse-variance weighting to yield a minimum-variance estimator. We provide formal guarantees in linear regression, validate the methods in neural networks, and demonstrate empirical gains in LLM distillation, including reduced systematic noise and hallucination. These results reframe knowledge distillation as an uncertainty transformation and show that variance-aware distillation produces more stable students that better reflect teacher uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u4e2d\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u4e86\u5b66\u751f\u95f4\u548c\u5b66\u751f\u5185\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u5dee\u611f\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u6559\u5e08\u54cd\u5e94\u5e73\u5747\u548c\u65b9\u5dee\u52a0\u6743\uff09\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u84b8\u998f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e09\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5177\u6709\u5185\u5728\u968f\u673a\u6027\uff08\u6559\u5e08\u8f93\u51fa\u3001\u5b66\u751f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u5747\u53ef\u80fd\u968f\u673a\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u591a\u91cd\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b66\u4e60\u5931\u771f\u3002", "method": "\u533a\u5206inter-student\u4e0eintra-student\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u5dee\u611f\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\uff1a(1) \u591a\u6b21\u91c7\u6837\u6559\u5e08\u54cd\u5e94\u5e76\u5e73\u5747\uff0c\u964d\u566a\u901f\u7387\u4e3aO(1/k)\uff1b(2) \u57fa\u4e8e\u9006\u65b9\u5dee\u52a0\u6743\u878d\u5408\u5e08\u751f\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u6700\u5c0f\u65b9\u5dee\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1b\u5728\u4e09\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u4e2d\u7ed9\u51fa\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff1b\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548cLLM\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff1b\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eLLM\u84b8\u998f\u4e2d\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u566a\u58f0\u4e0e\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6559\u5e08\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u5e94\u88ab\u91cd\u65b0\u7406\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53d8\u6362\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u65b9\u5dee\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u4f7f\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u66f4\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5730\u7ee7\u627f\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u3002"}}

Code is available at https://github.com/Luffy03/GF-Screen", "summary": "Pan-cancer screening in large-scale CT scans remains challenging for existing AI methods, primarily due to the difficulty of localizing diverse types of tiny lesions in large CT volumes. The extreme foreground-background imbalance significantly hinders models from focusing on diseased regions, while redundant focus on healthy regions not only decreases the efficiency but also increases false positives. Inspired by radiologists' glance and focus diagnostic strategy, we introduce GF-Screen, a Glance and Focus reinforcement learning framework for pan-cancer screening. GF-Screen employs a Glance model to localize the diseased regions and a Focus model to precisely segment the lesions, where segmentation results of the Focus model are leveraged to reward the Glance model via Reinforcement Learning (RL). Specifically, the Glance model crops a group of sub-volumes from the entire CT volume and learns to select the sub-volumes with lesions for the Focus model to segment. Given that the selecting operation is non-differentiable for segmentation training, we propose to employ the segmentation results to reward the Glance model. To optimize the Glance model, we introduce a novel group relative learning paradigm, which employs group relative comparison to prioritize high-advantage predictions and discard low-advantage predictions within sub-volume groups, not only improving efficiency but also reducing false positives. In this way, for the first time, we effectively extend cutting-edge RL techniques to tackle the specific challenges in pan-cancer screening. Extensive experiments on 16 internal and 7 external datasets across 9 lesion types demonstrated the effectiveness of GF-Screen. Notably, GF-Screen leads the public validation leaderboard of MICCAI FLARE25 pan-cancer challenge, surpassing the FLARE24 champion solution by a large margin (+25.6% DSC and +28.2% NSD).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faGF-Screen\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u201c\u626b\u89c6-\u805a\u7126\u201d\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21CT\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u764c\u79cd\u7b5b\u67e5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Glance\u6a21\u578b\u5b9a\u4f4d\u75c5\u7076\u533a\u57df\u3001Focus\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5206\u5272\u7ed3\u679c\u53cd\u9988\u5956\u52b1Glance\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7ec4\u5185\u76f8\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709AI\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6CT\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u591a\u79cd\u5fae\u5c0f\u75c5\u7076\uff0c\u4e14\u524d\u666f-\u80cc\u666f\u6781\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5173\u6ce8\u5065\u5eb7\u533a\u57df\u3001\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u5047\u9633\u6027\u9ad8\u3002\u53d7\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u2018\u5148\u626b\u89c6\u540e\u805a\u7126\u2019\u8bca\u65ad\u7b56\u7565\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "GF-Screen\u5305\u542bGlance\uff08\u7c97\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u88c1\u526a\u5b50\u4f53\u7d20\uff09\u548cFocus\uff08\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5206\u5272\uff09\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff1bGlance\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0d\u53ef\u5fae\uff0c\u6545\u7528Focus\u7684\u5206\u5272\u7ed3\u679c\u4f5c\u4e3aRL\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u7ec4\u5185\u76f8\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5bf9\u5b50\u4f53\u7d20\u7ec4\u5185\u9884\u6d4b\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u52bf\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u4f18\u5316\u9ad8\u4f18\u52bf\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u572816\u4e2a\u5185\u90e8+7\u4e2a\u5916\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u51719\u7c7b\u75c5\u7076\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\uff1b\u5728MICCAI FLARE25\u6cdb\u764c\u6311\u6218\u8d5b\u516c\u5f00\u9a8c\u8bc1\u699c\u6392\u540d\u7b2c\u4e00\uff0cDSC\u548cNSD\u5206\u522b\u6bd4FLARE24\u51a0\u519b\u9ad825.6%\u548c28.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "GF-Screen\u9996\u6b21\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u524d\u6cbf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u9002\u914d\u4e8e\u6cdb\u764c\u79cdCT\u7b5b\u67e5\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5728\u5b9a\u4f4d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u7a81\u7834\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u667a\u80fd\u7b5b\u67e5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

The limitations of existing utility-driven retrieval approaches for RAG are that, firstly, they are resource-intensive typically requiring query encoding, and that secondly, they do not involve listwise ranking loss during training. The latter limitation is particularly critical, as the relative order between documents directly affects generation in RAG. To address this gap, we propose Lightweight Utility-driven Reranking for Efficient RAG (LURE-RAG), a framework that augments any black-box retriever with an efficient LambdaMART-based reranker. Unlike prior methods, LURE-RAG trains the reranker with a listwise ranking loss guided by LLM utility, thereby directly optimizing the ordering of retrieved documents. Experiments on two standard datasets demonstrate that LURE-RAG achieves competitive performance, reaching 97-98% of the state-of-the-art dense neural baseline, while remaining efficient in both training and inference. Moreover, its dense variant, UR-RAG, significantly outperforms the best existing baseline by up to 3%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLURE-RAG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LambdaMART\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u6548\u7528\u9a71\u52a8\u7684listwise\u6392\u5e8f\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5bf9\u68c0\u7d22\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u8f7b\u91cf\u9ad8\u6548\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347RAG\u4e2d\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u8fbe\u5230\u63a5\u8fd1SOTA\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfRAG\u4f9d\u8d56\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u4f46\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4e0d\u7b49\u4e8e\u6548\u7528\uff08\u5373\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff09\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7528\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4flistwise\u6392\u5e8f\u635f\u5931\u4e24\u5927\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLURE-RAG\uff1a\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u9ed1\u76d2\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u540e\u63a5\u5165\u57fa\u4e8eLambdaMART\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6548\u7528\u4fe1\u53f7\u6784\u5efalistwise ranking loss\u8fdb\u884c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5176\u7a20\u5bc6\u53d8\u4f53UR-RAG\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cLURE-RAG\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u7a20\u5bc6\u6a21\u578b97\u201398%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u9ad8\u6548\uff1bUR-RAG\u8d85\u8d8a\u6700\u4f73\u57fa\u7ebf\u8fbe3%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6548\u7528\u9a71\u52a8\u7684listwise\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u662f\u63d0\u5347RAG\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8def\u5f84\uff0cLURE-RAG\u4ee5\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6548\u7528\u4e0e\u6392\u5e8f\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

Understanding how these associations are learned and represented in language models is essential for connecting deep learning with linguistic theory and developing a mechanistic foundation for large language models. In this work, we analyze how these associations emerge from natural language data in attention-based language models through the lens of training dynamics. By leveraging a leading-term approximation of the gradients, we develop closed-form expressions for the weights at early stages of training that explain how semantic associations first take shape. Through our analysis, we reveal that each set of weights of the transformer has closed-form expressions as simple compositions of three basis functions (bigram, token-interchangeability, and context mappings), reflecting the statistics of the text corpus and uncovering how each component of the transformer captures semantic associations based on these compositions.

Mainstream models leverage the Transformer attention mechanism to improve performance, but its computational complexity grows with the sequence length, leading to a latency challenge for long sequences. Consequently, KV cache technology has recently been explored in sequential recommendation systems to reduce inference latency. However, KV cache introduces substantial storage overhead in sequential recommendation systems, which often have a large user base with potentially very long user history sequences. In this work, we observe that KV sequences across different users exhibit significant similarities, indicating the existence of collaborative signals in KV. Furthermore, we analyze the KV using singular value decomposition (SVD) and find that the information in KV can be divided into two parts: the majority of the information is shareable across users, while a small portion is user-specific. Motivated by this, we propose CollectiveKV, a cross-user KV sharing mechanism. It captures the information shared across users through a learnable global KV pool. During inference, each user retrieves high-dimensional shared KV from the pool and concatenates them with low-dimensional user-specific KV to obtain the final KV. Experiments on five sequential recommendation models and three datasets show that our method can compress the KV cache to only 0.8% of its original size, while maintaining or even enhancing model performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCollectiveKV\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u8de8\u7528\u6237KV\u5171\u4eab\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5168\u5c40KV\u6c60\u6355\u83b7\u7528\u6237\u95f4\u5171\u4eab\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u538b\u7f29KV\u7f13\u5b58\uff08\u964d\u81f3\u539f\u5927\u5c0f0.8%\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "KV\u7f13\u5b58\u867d\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7528\u6237\u91cf\u5927\u3001\u5386\u53f2\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5e26\u6765\u5de8\u5927\u5b58\u50a8\u5f00\u9500\uff1b\u4f5c\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u7528\u6237\u7684KV\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u8574\u542b\u534f\u540c\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4e14SVD\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660eKV\u4fe1\u606f\u4e3b\u8981\u53ef\u5171\u4eab\u3001\u4ec5\u5c11\u91cf\u7528\u6237\u7279\u6709\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCollectiveKV\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5168\u5c40KV\u6c60\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\u8de8\u7528\u6237\u5171\u4eab\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7528\u6237\u4ece\u6c60\u4e2d\u68c0\u7d22\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5171\u4eabKV\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4f4e\u7ef4\u7528\u6237\u7279\u6709KV\u62fc\u63a5\u5f62\u6210\u6700\u7ec8KV\u3002", "result": "\u57285\u79cd\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\u548c3\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06KV\u7f13\u5b58\u538b\u7f29\u81f3\u539f\u59cb\u5927\u5c0f\u76840.8%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u6301\u751a\u81f3\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "CollectiveKV\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86KV\u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u538b\u529b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u7528\u6237\u95f4KV\u534f\u540c\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u7f13\u5b58\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Recent work suggests that label informativeness (LI), the mutual information between labels of adjacent nodes, provides a more faithful characterization of when graph structure is useful. In this work, we develop a unified theoretical framework that connects curvature-guided rewiring and positional geometry through the lens of label informativeness, and instantiate it in a practical geometry-aware architecture, ASEHybrid. Our analysis provides a necessary-and-sufficient characterization of when geometry-aware GNNs can improve over feature-only baselines: such gains are possible if and only if graph structure carries label-relevant information beyond node features. Theoretically, we relate adjusted homophily and label informativeness to the spectral behavior of label signals under Laplacian smoothing, show that degree-based Forman curvature does not increase expressivity beyond the one-dimensional Weisfeiler--Lehman test but instead reshapes information flow, and establish convergence and Lipschitz stability guarantees for a curvature-guided rewiring process. Empirically, we instantiate ASEHybrid using Forman curvature and Laplacian positional encodings and conduct controlled ablations on Chameleon, Squirrel, Texas, Tolokers, and Minesweeper, observing gains precisely on label-informative heterophilous benchmarks where graph structure provides label-relevant information beyond node features, and no meaningful improvement in high-baseline regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u7b7e\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\uff08Label Informativeness, LI\uff09\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u4f55\u65f6\u771f\u6b63\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8282\u70b9\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u67b6\u6784ASEHybrid\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5145\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\u662f\u5176\u643a\u5e26\u4e86\u8d85\u8d8a\u8282\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u4f46\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u56fe\u4e0a\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6GNN\u5728\u4f4e\u540c\u8d28\u6027\u56fe\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\uff0c\u4f46\u540c\u8d28\u6027\u672c\u8eab\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b\u90e8\u5206\u5f02\u8d28\u56fe\u4ecd\u6613\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u9700\u66f4\u672c\u8d28\u7684\u5224\u636e\u2014\u2014\u6807\u7b7e\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\uff08LI\uff09\u88ab\u63d0\u51fa\u4f5c\u4e3a\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u523b\u753b\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u6709\u7528\u6027\u7684\u6307\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4ee5\u6807\u7b7e\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5173\u8054\u66f2\u7387\u5f15\u5bfc\u91cd\u8fde\u4e0e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u51e0\u4f55\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5GNN\u67b6\u6784ASEHybrid\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Forman\u66f2\u7387\u4e0e\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u6db5\u76d6\u8c31\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u9650\u5236\u3001\u91cd\u8fde\u6536\u655b\u6027\u4e0eLipschitz\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\uff1a\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5GNN\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eaf\u7279\u5f81\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u5145\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\u662f\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u8d85\u51fa\u8282\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eASEHybrid\u5728Chameleon\u3001Squirrel\u7b49\u6807\u7b7e\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u4f46\u5f02\u8d28\u7684\u56fe\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u57fa\u7ebf\u573a\u666f\u65e0\u660e\u663e\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6807\u7b7e\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\uff08LI\uff09\u662f\u6bd4\u540c\u8d28\u6027\u66f4\u6839\u672c\u7684\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5224\u636e\uff1b\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u5efa\u6a21\uff08\u5982\u66f2\u7387+\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\uff09\u4ec5\u5728LI\u8f83\u9ad8\u65f6\u5e26\u6765\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u2018\u7ed3\u6784\u6709\u7528\u6027\u2019\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u5728\u4e8e\u5176\u662f\u5426\u627f\u8f7d\u989d\u5916\u6807\u7b7e\u4fe1\u606f\u3002"}}

While deep learning has accelerated inference, it often struggles with domain shifts. Emerging registration foundation models offer a balance of speed and robustness, yet typically cannot match the peak accuracy of specialized models trained on specific datasets. To mitigate this limitation, we propose Reg-TTR, a test-time refinement framework that synergizes the complementary strengths of both deep learning and conventional registration techniques. By refining the predictions of pre-trained models at inference, our method delivers significantly improved registration accuracy at a modest computational cost, requiring only 21% additional inference time (0.56s). We evaluate Reg-TTR on two distinct tasks and show that it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while maintaining inference speeds close to previous deep learning methods. As foundation models continue to emerge, our framework offers an efficient strategy to narrow the performance gap between registration foundation models and SOTA methods trained on specialized datasets.

Using real-world search behaviour, we compare outputs from a bespoke semantic search system applied to UKRI data services with the Consumer Data Research Centre (CDRC) keyword search. Analysis is based on 131 of the most frequently used search terms extracted from CDRC search logs between December 2023 and October 2024. We assess differences in the volume, overlap, ranking, and relevance of returned datasets using descriptive statistics, qualitative inspection, and quantitative similarity measures, including exact dataset overlap, Jaccard similarity, and cosine similarity derived from BERT embeddings. Results show that the semantic search consistently returns a larger number of results than the keyword search and performs particularly well for place based, misspelled, obscure, or complex queries. While the semantic search does not capture all keyword based results, the datasets returned are overwhelmingly semantically similar, with high cosine similarity scores despite lower exact overlap. Rankings of the most relevant results differ substantially between tools, reflecting contrasting prioritisation strategies. Case studies demonstrate that the LLM based tool is robust to spelling errors, interprets geographic and contextual relevance effectively, and supports natural-language queries that keyword search fails to resolve.

However, the respective methods to solve such problems are often developed in an isolated, task-specific manner and thus lack a unifying theoretical foundation. Here, we provide a stepping stone towards the formation of such a foundation and further development by introducing the Neural Graph Inverse Problem (GraIP) conceptual framework, which formalizes and reframes a broad class of graph learning tasks as inverse problems. Unlike discriminative approaches that directly predict target variables from given graph inputs, the GraIP paradigm addresses inverse problems, i.e., it relies on observational data and aims to recover the underlying graph structure by reversing the forward process, such as message passing or network dynamics, that produced the observed outputs. We demonstrate the versatility of GraIP across various graph learning tasks, including rewiring, causal discovery, and neural relational inference. We also propose benchmark datasets and metrics for each GraIP domain considered, and characterize and empirically evaluate existing baseline methods used to solve them.

We propose FBSDiff, a novel framework adapting off-the-shelf T2I diffusion model into the I2I paradigm from a fresh frequency-domain perspective. Through dynamic frequency band substitution of diffusion features, FBSDiff realizes versatile and highly controllable text-driven I2I in a plug-and-play manner (without need for model training, fine-tuning, or online optimization), allowing appearance-guided, layout-guided, and contour-guided I2I translation by progressively substituting low-frequency band, mid-frequency band, and high-frequency band of latent diffusion features, respectively. In addition, FBSDiff flexibly enables continuous control over I2I correlation intensity simply by tuning the bandwidth of the substituted frequency band. To further promote image translation efficiency, flexibility, and functionality, we propose FBSDiff++ which improves upon FBSDiff mainly in three aspects: (1) accelerate inference speed by a large margin (8.9$\\times$ speedup in inference) with refined model architecture; (2) improve the Frequency Band Substitution module to allow for input source images of arbitrary resolution and aspect ratio; (3) extend model functionality to enable localized image manipulation and style-specific content creation with only subtle adjustments to the core method.

While recent efforts aim to improve content diversity, they predominantly operate in static or one-shot settings, neglecting the long-term evolution of user interests. Reinforcement learning provides a principled framework for optimizing long-term user satisfaction by modeling sequential decision-making processes. However, its application in recommendation is hindered by sparse, long-tailed user-item interactions and limited semantic planning capabilities. In this work, we propose LLM-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning (LERL), a novel hierarchical recommendation framework that integrates the semantic planning power of LLM with the fine-grained adaptability of RL. LERL consists of a high-level LLM-based planner that selects semantically diverse content categories, and a low-level RL policy that recommends personalized items within the selected semantic space.

However, there is a significant lack of research into their internal state as an editable knowledge representation. To fill this gap, we first explore the representational properties of the RWKV state by proposing the DREAMSTATE framework. This framework utilizes a conditional Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to directly model the probability manifold of the state, enabling its generation and editing. The structural nature of this representation is validated through t-SNE visualizations and controlled generation experiments. After successfully uncovering and modeling the state's representational potential, we further propose a novel hybrid architecture that combines the local advantages of RNNs with global context adaptability. This architecture features a parallel DiT that processes a variable-length global context to dynamically generate and adjust the core recurrent module's WKV parameters, transforming the fixed recurrence mechanism into a context-aware dynamic function. Experiments demonstrate that this hybrid model can be trained stably via a multi-objective loss, validating its design feasibility. Our work not only opens a new research direction for RNN state representation but also provides a concrete architectural reference for future model design.

Technical report/winner report for the VN2 Inventory Planning Challenge (2025)", "summary": "Inventory planning for retail chains requires translating demand forecasts into ordering decisions, including asymmetric shortages and holding costs. The VN2 Inventory Planning Challenge formalizes this setting as a weekly decision-making cycle with a two-week product delivery lead time, where the total cost is defined as the shortage cost plus the holding cost. This report presents the winning VN2 solution: a two-stage predict-then-optimize pipeline that combines a single global multi-horizon forecasting model with a cost-aware ordering policy. The forecasting model is trained in a global paradigm, jointly using all available time series. A gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) model implemented in CatBoost is used as the base learner. The model incorporates stockout-aware feature engineering to address censored demand during out-of-stock periods, per-series scaling to focus learning on time-series patterns rather than absolute levels, and time-based observation weights to reflect shifts in demand patterns.

Most domain generalization (DG) methods based on domain adversarial learning (DAL) pay much attention to learn domain-invariant information, but often overlook the potential non-causal factors. We unveil two critical causes: 1) The domain discriminator-based DAL method is subject to the extremely sparse domain label, i.e., assigning only one domain label to each dataset, thus can only associate explicit non-causal factor, which is incredibly limited. 2) The non-causal factors, induced by unidentified data bias, are excessively implicit and cannot be solely discerned by conventional DAL paradigm. Based on these key findings, inspired by the Granular-Ball perspective, we propose an improved DAL method, i.e., GB-DAL. The proposed GB-DAL utilizes Prototype-based Granular Ball Splitting (PGBS) module to generate more dense domains from limited datasets, akin to more fine-grained granular balls, indicating more potential non-causal factors. Inspired by adversarial perturbations akin to non-causal factors, we propose a Simulated Non-causal Factors (SNF) module as a means of data augmentation to reduce the implicitness of non-causal factors, and facilitate the training of GB-DAL.

Conversely, task-only reinforcement learning admits many task-optimal solutions, often resulting in unnatural or unstable motions.

Jose", "Zhaochun Ren"], "title": "Differentiable Semantic ID for Generative Recommendation", "comment": null, "summary": "Generative recommendation provides a novel paradigm in which each item is represented by a discrete semantic ID (SID) learned from rich content. Most existing methods treat SIDs as predefined and train recommenders under static indexing. In practice, SIDs are typically optimized only for content reconstruction rather than recommendation accuracy. This leads to an objective mismatch: the system optimizes an indexing loss to learn the SID and a recommendation loss for interaction prediction, but because the tokenizer is trained independently, the recommendation loss cannot update it. A natural approach is to make semantic indexing differentiable so that recommendation gradients can directly influence SID learning, but this often causes codebook collapse, where only a few codes are used. We attribute this issue to early deterministic assignments that limit codebook exploration, resulting in imbalance and unstable optimization.\n  In this paper, we propose DIGER (Differentiable Semantic ID for Generative Recommendation), a first step toward effective differentiable semantic IDs for generative recommendation. DIGER introduces Gumbel noise to explicitly encourage early-stage exploration over codes, mitigating codebook collapse and improving code utilization. To balance exploration and convergence, we further design two uncertainty decay strategies that gradually reduce the Gumbel noise, enabling a smooth transition from early exploration to exploitation of learned SIDs.

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this issue by grounding answers in external sources, e.g., knowledge graphs (KGs). However, existing KG-based RAG approaches rely on semantics-unaware path sampling and are weakly aligned with KG reasoning objectives, which limits further accuracy gains. They also feed retrieved paths directly into the reasoner without organizing them into answer-centered reasoning paths, hindering small LLMs' ability to leverage the retrieved knowledge. Furthermore, prior works predominantly rely on large LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT/GPT-4) or assume backbones above 7B parameters, leaving sub-7B models underexplored. We address this gap with RPO-RAG, the first KG-based RAG framework specifically designed for small LLMs, to the best of our knowledge. RPO-RAG introduces three key innovations: (1) a query-path semantic sampling strategy that provides informative supervisory signals; (2) a relation-aware preference optimization that aligns training with intermediate KG reasoning signals (e.g., relation); and (3) an answer-centered prompt design that organizes entities and reasoning paths in an interpretable format. Extensive experiments on two benchmark Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) datasets, WebQSP and CWQ, demonstrate that RPO-RAG effectively bridges the performance gap between small and large language models. On WebQSP, it improves F1 by up to 8.8%, reflecting enhanced answer precision, while on CWQ it achieves new state-of-the-art results among models under 8B parameters in both Hit and F1. Overall, RPO-RAG substantially improves the reasoning capability of small LLMs, even under 3B parameters-highlighting their potential for resource-efficient and practical on-device KGQA applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86RPO-RAG\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u4e13\u4e3a\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08<8B\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u8def\u5f84\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u5173\u7cfb\u611f\u77e5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u7b54\u6848\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8def\u5f84\u91c7\u6837\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u63a8\u7406\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\u5f31\u3001\u672a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e3a\u7b54\u6848\u4e2d\u5fc3\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\uff08<7B\uff09\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRPO-RAG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u9879\u521b\u65b0\uff1a(1) \u67e5\u8be2-\u8def\u5f84\u8bed\u4e49\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff1b(2) \u5173\u7cfb\u611f\u77e5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u5982\u5173\u7cfb\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b(3) \u7b54\u6848\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u683c\u5f0f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5b9e\u4f53\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u5728WebQSP\u548cCWQ\u4e24\u4e2aKGQA\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6548\u679c\uff1aWebQSP\u4e0aF1\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe8.8%\uff1bCWQ\u4e0a\u5728<8B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230Hit\u548cF1\u65b0SOTA\uff1b\u751a\u81f3\u5728<3B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e5f\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "RPO-RAG\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5c0f\u53c2\u6570\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u548c\u7aef\u4fa7\u90e8\u7f72\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Compositional methods improve interpretability, but most rely on a single agent or hand-crafted pipeline and cannot decide when to collaborate across complementary agents or compete among overlapping ones. We introduce MATA (Multi-Agent hierarchical Trainable Automaton), a multi-agent system presented as a hierarchical finite-state automaton for visual reasoning whose top-level transitions are chosen by a trainable hyper agent. Each agent corresponds to a state in the hyper automaton, and runs a small rule-based sub-automaton for reliable micro-control. All agents read and write a shared memory, yielding transparent execution history. To supervise the hyper agent's transition policy, we build transition-trajectory trees and transform to memory-to-next-state pairs, forming the MATA-SFT-90K dataset for supervised finetuning (SFT). The finetuned LLM as the transition policy understands the query and the capacity of agents, and it can efficiently choose the optimal agent to solve the task.

We cast this problem as learning the parameters of a discrete Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). The agent begins with knowledge of the POMDP's actions and observation spaces, but not its state space, transitions, or observation models. These properties must be constructed from action-observation sequences. Spectral approaches to learning models of partially observable domains, such as learning Predictive State Representations (PSRs), are known to directly estimate the number of hidden states. These methods cannot, however, yield direct estimates of transition and observation likelihoods, which are important for many downstream reasoning tasks. Other approaches leverage tensor decompositions to estimate transition and observation likelihoods but often assume full state observability and full-rank transition matrices for all actions. To relax these assumptions, we study how PSRs learn transition and observation matrices up to a similarity transform, which may be estimated via tensor methods. Our method learns observation matrices and transition matrices up to a partition of states, where the states in a single partition have the same observation distributions corresponding to actions whose transition matrices are full-rank. Our experiments suggest that these partition-level transition models learned by our method, with a sufficient amount of data, meets the performance of PSRs as models to be used by standard sampling-based POMDP solvers. Furthermore, the explicit observation and transition likelihoods can be leveraged to specify planner behavior after the model has been learned.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08POMDP\uff09\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u8f6c\u79fb\u548c\u89c2\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u9884\u6d4b\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\uff08PSR\uff09\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5f20\u91cf\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u5047\u8bbe\u5b8c\u5168\u72b6\u6001\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6216\u6ee1\u79e9\u8f6c\u79fb\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba1\u51fa\u53ef\u88ab\u4e0b\u6e38\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0e\u8f6c\u79fb\u6982\u7387\u77e9\u9635\uff08\u81f3\u72b6\u6001\u5212\u5206\u7b49\u4ef7\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u80fd\u4f30\u8ba1\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u6570\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\u8f6c\u79fb/\u89c2\u6d4b\u6982\u7387\uff08\u5982PSR\uff09\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u9700\u5f3a\u5047\u8bbe\uff08\u5982\u5168\u72b6\u6001\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u3001\u6240\u6709\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u8f6c\u79fb\u77e9\u9635\u6ee1\u79e9\uff09\u624d\u80fd\u4f30\u8ba1\u6982\u7387\uff1b\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u5e26\u9690\u85cf\u9501\u5177\u7684\u5bb6\u5177\uff09\u8981\u6c42\u5728\u5f31\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u540c\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u6982\u7387\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u4e0b\u6e38\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8ePSR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5bf9\u8f6c\u79fb\u548c\u89c2\u6d4b\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u53d8\u6362\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5f20\u91cf\u5206\u89e3\u4f30\u8ba1\u8fd9\u4e9b\u77e9\u9635\u81f3\u72b6\u6001\u5212\u5206\u7b49\u4ef7\u7c7b\uff1b\u5373\u540c\u4e00\u5212\u5206\u5185\u72b6\u6001\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e0b\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u5bf9\u5177\u6709\u6ee1\u79e9\u8f6c\u79fb\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u6709\u6548\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5145\u5206\u65f6\uff0c\u6240\u5b66\u7684\u5212\u5206\u7ea7\u8f6c\u79fb\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8e\u6807\u51c6PSR\uff0c\u4e14\u663e\u5f0f\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0e\u8f6c\u79fb\u6982\u7387\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u5f0fPOMDP\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u89c4\u5212\u884c\u4e3a\u5b9a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u653e\u5bbd\u5173\u952e\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u4e86\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6982\u7387\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

These failures stem from two compounding factors: such components are rare in training data, yet they share identical local geometry with dominant structures like pipes. This work identifies a dual crisis unique to industrial 3D data extreme class imbalance 215:1 ratio compounded by geometric ambiguity where most tail classes share cylindrical primitives with head classes. Existing frequency-based re-weighting methods address statistical imbalance but cannot resolve geometric ambiguity. We propose spatial context constraints that leverage neighborhood prediction consistency to disambiguate locally similar structures. Our approach extends the Class-Balanced (CB) Loss framework with two architecture-agnostic mechanisms: (1) Boundary-CB, an entropy-based constraint that emphasizes ambiguous boundaries, and (2) Density-CB, a density-based constraint that compensates for scan-dependent variations. Both integrate as plug-and-play modules without network modifications, requiring only loss function replacement. On the Industrial3D dataset (610M points from water treatment facilities), our method achieves 55.74% mIoU with 21.7% relative improvement on tail-class performance (29.59% vs. 24.32% baseline) while preserving head-class accuracy (88.14%). Components with primitive-sharing ambiguity show dramatic gains: reducer improves from 0% to 21.12% IoU; valve improves by 24.3% relative. This resolves geometric ambiguity without the typical head-tail trade-off, enabling reliable identification of safety-critical components for automated knowledge extraction in Digital Twin applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08Boundary-CB\u548cDensity-CB\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff08215:1\uff09\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u6b67\u4e49\uff08\u5c3e\u90e8\u7c7b\u4e0e\u5934\u90e8\u7c7b\u5171\u4eab\u5706\u67f1\u4f53\u7d20\uff09\u5e76\u5b58\u7684\u5de5\u4e1a\u70b9\u4e91\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u90e8\u4ef6\uff08\u5982\u51cf\u901f\u5668\u3001\u9600\u95e8\uff09\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u5934\u90e8\u7c7b\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de5\u4e1a\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6784\u5efa\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u90e8\u4ef6\uff08\u5982\u51cf\u901f\u5668\u3001\u9600\u95e8\uff09\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u6781\u5ea6\u7a00\u5c11\u4e14\u5c40\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u4e3b\u6d41\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5982\u7ba1\u9053\uff09\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u9891\u7387\u7684\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u51e0\u4f55\u6b67\u4e49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5728Class-Balanced Loss\u6846\u67b6\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u79cd\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ea6\u675f\u673a\u5236\uff1a(1) Boundary-CB\u2014\u2014\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u5f3a\u8c03\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u6b67\u4e49\u533a\u57df\uff1b(2) Density-CB\u2014\u2014\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u8865\u507f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u626b\u63cf\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u4e8c\u8005\u4ec5\u9700\u66ff\u6362\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5728Industrial3D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff086.1\u4ebf\u70b9\uff09\u4e0a\uff0cmIoU\u8fbe55.74%\uff0c\u5c3e\u90e8\u7c7b\u522b\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u534721.7%\uff0829.59% vs. 24.32%\uff09\uff1b\u51cf\u901f\u5668IoU\u4ece0%\u63d0\u5347\u81f321.12%\uff0c\u9600\u95e8IoU\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u534724.3%\uff1b\u5934\u90e8\u7c7b\u522b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4fdd\u630188.14%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u8026\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u6b67\u4e49\u53cc\u91cd\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u5934\u90e8\u7c7b\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u90e8\u4ef6\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u63d0\u53d6\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Since the presence of negative edges violates the graph homophily assumption that adjacent nodes are similar, regular graph methods have not been applicable without auxiliary structures to handle them. We aim to directly model the latent statistical dependency among edges with the Gaussian copula and its corresponding correlation matrix, extending CopulaGNN. However, a naive modeling of edge-edge relations is computationally intractable even for a graph with moderate scale.

Existing hallucination detection methods achieve strong performance when the training and test data come from the same domain, but they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization. In this paper, we study an important yet overlooked problem, termed generalizable hallucination detection (GHD), which aims to train hallucination detectors on data from a single domain while ensuring robust performance across diverse related domains. In studying GHD, we simulate multi-turn dialogues following LLMs initial response and observe an interesting phenomenon: hallucination-initiated multi-turn dialogues universally exhibit larger uncertainty fluctuations than factual ones across different domains. Based on the phenomenon, we propose a new score SpikeScore, which quantifies abrupt fluctuations in multi-turn dialogues. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that SpikeScore achieves strong cross-domain separability between hallucinated and non-hallucinated responses. Experiments across multiple LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that the SpikeScore-based detection method outperforms representative baselines in cross-domain generalization and surpasses advanced generalization-oriented methods, verifying the effectiveness of our method in cross-domain hallucination detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSpikeScore\u7684\u65b0\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u601d\u60f3\u662f\u5229\u7528\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6ce2\u52a8\u7684\u7a81\u53d8\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u533a\u5206\u5e7b\u89c9\u4e0e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u540c\u57df\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff1b\u672c\u6587\u5173\u6ce8\u4e00\u4e2a\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u4f46\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u2014\u2014\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08GHD\uff09\uff0c\u5373\u4ec5\u7528\u5355\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u5374\u80fd\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u76f8\u5173\u9886\u57df\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u2018\u5e7b\u89c9\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5927\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6ce2\u52a8\u2019\u8fd9\u4e00\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u63d0\u51faSpikeScore\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u7a81\u53d8\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "SpikeScore\u5728\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u5bfc\u5411\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SpikeScore\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u3001\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347LLM\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

We model this two-time-scale interaction using an upper-level online convex optimization (OCO) problem and a lower-level constrained Markov decision process (CMDP). Existing OCO typically assumes stateless decisions and thus cannot capture MDP network dynamics such as queue evolution. Meanwhile, CMDP algorithms typically assume a fixed constraint threshold, whereas in provisioning-and-scheduling systems, the threshold varies with online budget decisions. To address these gaps, we study bi-level OCO-CMDP learning under switching costs (budget reprovisioning/system reconfiguration) and cross-level constraints that couple budgets to scheduling decisions.

Exposure correction still faces two critical challenges: (1) the ignorance of object-wise regional semantic information causes the color shift artifacts; (2) real-world exposure images generally have no ground-truth labels, and its labeling entails massive manual editing. To tackle the challenges, we propose a new unsupervised semantic-aware exposure correction network. It contains an adaptive semantic-aware fusion module, which effectively fuses the semantic information extracted from a pre-trained Fast Segment Anything Model into a shared image feature space. Then the fused features are used by our multi-scale residual spatial mamba group to restore the details and adjust the exposure. To avoid manual editing, we propose a pseudo-ground truth generator guided by CLIP, which is fine-tuned to automatically identify exposure situations and instruct the tailored corrections. Also, we leverage the rich priors from the FastSAM and CLIP to develop a semantic-prompt consistency loss to enforce semantic consistency and image-prompt alignment for unsupervised training. Comprehensive experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of our method in correcting real-world exposure images and outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods both numerically and visually.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u66dd\u5149\u6821\u6b63\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408FastSAM\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6b8b\u5dee\u7a7a\u95f4Mamba\u7ed3\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u8282\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528CLIP\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u4f2a\u771f\u503c\u53ca\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bed\u4e49-\u63d0\u793a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5931\u771f\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u66dd\u5149\u4e0d\u5f53\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ec6\u8282\u4e22\u5931\u3001\u8272\u5f69\u5931\u771f\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u7269\u4f53\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u5f15\u53d1\u8272\u5f69\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u4e14\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u66dd\u5149\u6821\u6b63\u7f51\u7edc\uff1a1\uff09\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5c06FastSAM\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5165\u5171\u4eab\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b2\uff09\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6b8b\u5dee\u7a7a\u95f4Mamba\u7ec4\u7528\u4e8e\u7ec6\u8282\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u66dd\u5149\u8c03\u6574\uff1b3\uff09CLIP\u5fae\u8c03\u751f\u6210\u4f2a\u771f\u503c\uff1b4\uff09\u57fa\u4e8eFastSAM\u548cCLIP\u5148\u9a8c\u6784\u5efa\u8bed\u4e49-\u63d0\u793a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u66dd\u5149\u56fe\u50cf\u6821\u6b63\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u503c\u6307\u6807\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u878d\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u66dd\u5149\u6821\u6b63\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u65e0\u6807\u6ce8\u3001\u9700\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

A common approach to provide formal goal-reaching guarantees is to introduce a shielding mechanism that restricts the agent to actions that satisfy predefined safety constraints. The main challenge here is integrating this mechanism with RL so that learning and exploration remain effective without becoming overly conservative. Hence, this paper proposes an RL-based control framework that provides formal goal-reaching guarantees for wheeled mobile robots operating in unstructured environments. We first design a real-time RL policy with a set of 15 carefully defined reward terms. These rewards encourage the robot to reach both static and dynamic goals while generating sufficiently smooth command signals that comply with predefined safety specifications, which is critical in practice. Second, a Lyapunov-like stabilizer layer is integrated into the benchmark RL framework as a policy supervisor to formally strengthen the goal-reaching control while preserving meaningful exploration of the state action space. The proposed framework is suitable for real-time deployment in challenging environments, as it provides a formal guarantee of convergence to the intended goal states and compensates for uncertainties by generating real-time control signals based on the current state, while respecting real-world motion constraints. The experimental results show that the proposed Lyapunov-like stabilizer consistently improves the benchmark RL policies, boosting the goal-reaching rate from 84.6% to 99.0%, sharply reducing failures, and improving efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0eLyapunov-like\u7a33\u5b9a\u5668\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f6e\u5f0f\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5230\u8fbe\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6210\u529f\u7387\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u6548\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u5fc5\u8fbe\u6027\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u5c4f\u853d\u673a\u5236\u867d\u53ef\u589e\u5f3a\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4fdd\u5b88\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u542b15\u9879\u5956\u52b1\u9879\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6RL\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210Lyapunov-like\u7a33\u5b9a\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u76d1\u7763\u5c42\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u969c\u6536\u655b\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u6301\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u72b6\u6001-\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u76ee\u6807\u5230\u8fbe\u7387\u4ece84.6%\u63d0\u5347\u81f399.0%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5931\u8d25\u7387\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u517c\u987e\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u3002"}}

We demonstrate that SynCABEL, when combined with decoder-only models and guided inference establish new state-of-the-art results across three widely used multilingual benchmarks: MedMentions for English, QUAERO for French, and SPACCC for Spanish. Evaluating data efficiency, we show that SynCABEL reaches the performance of full human supervision using up to 60% less annotated data, substantially reducing reliance on labor-intensive and costly expert labeling.

The system includes a triples creator that builds structured facts about a concept, a semantic mapper that selects attributes useful for analogy, a stylized generator that turns them into riddle clues, and a validator that collects all possible answers the riddle could point to. We use this validator to study whether large language models can recover the full answer set for different riddle types.

We propose the Global Verifier (GLOVE), a framework that introduces a new design dimension for LLM memory systems by establishing a relative notion of truth.

Conventional approaches project DVL velocities from the body coordinate system to the navigation coordinate system using SINS-derived attitude; however, accumulated attitude estimation errors introduce biases into velocity projection and degrade navigation performance during long-term operation. To address this issue, two complementary improvements are introduced. First, a vehicle attitude error-aware DVL velocity transformation model is formulated by incorporating attitude error terms into the observation equation to reduce projection-induced velocity bias. Second, a covariance matrix-based variance propagation method is developed to transform DVL measurement uncertainty across coordinate systems, introducing an expectation-based attitude error compensation term to achieve statistically consistent noise modeling. Simulation and field experiment results demonstrate that both improvements individually enhance navigation accuracy and confirm that accumulated attitude errors affect both projected velocity measurements and their associated uncertainty. When jointly applied, long-term error divergence is effectively suppressed. Field experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a 78.3% improvement in 3D position RMSE and a 71.8% reduction in the maximum component-wise position error compared with the baseline IMU+DVL method, providing a robust solution for improving long-term SINS/DVL navigation performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8003\u8651\u59ff\u6001\u8bef\u5dee\u7684DVL\u901f\u5ea6\u53d8\u6362\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6c34\u4e0bSINS/DVL\u7ec4\u5408\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u957f\u671f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfSINS/DVL\u677e\u8026\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u7531SINS\u59ff\u6001\u8bef\u5dee\u5f15\u8d77\u7684DVL\u901f\u5ea6\u6295\u5f71\u504f\u5dee\u4f1a\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u7d2f\u79ef\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bfc\u822a\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u59ff\u6001\u8bef\u5dee\u611f\u77e5\u7684DVL\u901f\u5ea6\u53d8\u6362\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u89c2\u6d4b\u65b9\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u59ff\u6001\u8bef\u5dee\u9879\uff1b2\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0DVL\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5728\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u95f4\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u5e76\u52a0\u5165\u671f\u671b\u59ff\u6001\u8bef\u5dee\u8865\u507f\u9879\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff1a\u4e24\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u5404\u81ea\u63d0\u5347\u5bfc\u822a\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b\u8054\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u957f\u671f\u8bef\u5dee\u53d1\u6563\uff1b\u5b9e\u6d4b3D\u4f4d\u7f6eRMSE\u63d0\u534778.3%\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u5206\u91cf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e71.8%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584SINS/DVL\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u8fd0\u884c\u4e0b\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002"}}

However, these approaches fall short of comprehensively capturing user preferences-including long-term, short-term, and fine-grained aspects-, and of using them to rank and select actions, proactively personalize interactions, and ensure ethically responsible adaptations. To address the limitations, we propose drawing on recommender systems (RSs), which specialize in modeling user preferences and providing personalized recommendations.

However, existing widely adopted model-based draft designs, such as EAGLE3, improve accuracy at the cost of multi-step autoregressive inference, resulting in high drafting latency and ultimately rendering the drafting stage itself a performance bottleneck. Inspired by diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs), we propose DART, which leverages parallel generation to reduce drafting latency. DART predicts logits for multiple future masked positions in parallel within a single forward pass based on hidden states of the target model, thereby eliminating autoregressive rollouts in the draft model while preserving a lightweight design. Based on these parallel logit predictions, we further introduce an efficient tree pruning algorithm that constructs high-quality draft token trees with N-gram-enforced semantic continuity. DART substantially reduces draft-stage overhead while preserving high draft accuracy, leading to significantly improved end-to-end decoding speed.

We introduce a curiosity driven knowledge retrieval framework that formalizes uncertainty during execution as a curiosity score. When this score exceeds a threshold, the system retrieves external information from documentation, code repositories, and historical trajectories. Retrieved content is organized into structured AppCards, which encode functional semantics, parameter conventions, interface mappings, and interaction patterns. During execution, an enhanced agent selectively integrates relevant AppCards into its reasoning process, thereby compensating for knowledge blind spots and improving planning reliability. Evaluation on the AndroidWorld benchmark shows consistent improvements across backbones, with an average gain of six percentage points and a new state of the art success rate of 88.8\\% when combined with GPT-5. Analysis indicates that AppCards are particularly effective for multi step and cross application tasks, while improvements depend on the backbone model.

Using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and linear probes, we isolate the 3% of MLP neurons most predictive of a target behavior, decode them into residual space, and fine-tune only those neurons using gradient masking. We demonstrate this approach on the task of reducing sycophantic behavior, where our method matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks (Syco-Bench, NLP, POLI, PHIL) using Gemma-2-2B and 9B models.

However, standard convolutional architectures often yield topologically disjointed segmentations, characterized by gaps and discontinuities that render reliable graph-based clinical analysis impossible despite high pixel-level accuracy. To address this, we introduce a topology-aware framework engineered to maintain vascular connectivity. Our architecture fuses a Topological Feature Fusion Module (TFFM) that maps local feature representations into a latent graph space, deploying Graph Attention Networks to capture global structural dependencies often missed by fixed receptive fields. Furthermore, we drive the learning process with a hybrid objective function, coupling Tversky loss for class imbalance with soft clDice loss to explicitly penalize topological disconnects. Evaluation on the Fundus-AVSeg dataset reveals state-of-the-art performance, achieving a combined Dice score of 90.97% and a 95% Hausdorff Distance of 3.50 pixels.

However, their integration in robotic control pipelines remains limited in two aspects: (1) prior \\ac{llm}-based approaches often lack modular, agentic execution mechanisms, limiting their ability to plan, reflect on outcomes, and revise actions in a closed-loop manner; and (2) existing benchmarks for manipulation tasks focus on low-level control and do not systematically evaluate multistep reasoning and linguistic variation. In this paper, we propose Agentic LLM for Robot Manipulation (ALRM), an LLM-driven agentic framework for robotic manipulation. ALRM integrates policy generation with agentic execution through a ReAct-style reasoning loop, supporting two complementary modes: Code-asPolicy (CaP) for direct executable control code generation, and Tool-as-Policy (TaP) for iterative planning and tool-based action execution. To enable systematic evaluation, we also introduce a novel simulation benchmark comprising 56 tasks across multiple environments, capturing linguistically diverse instructions. Experiments with ten LLMs demonstrate that ALRM provides a scalable, interpretable, and modular approach for bridging natural language reasoning with reliable robotic execution.

In this work, we address these challenges with a recommendation model that leverages the structure of psychometric data to provide visual explanations that are faithful to the model and interpretable by care professionals. We focus on a narrow healthcare niche, gerontological primary care, to show that the proposed recommendation model can assist the attending professional in the creation of personalised care plans. We report results of a comparative offline performance evaluation of the proposed model on healthcare datasets that were collected by research partners in Brazil, as well as the results of a user study that evaluates the interpretability of the visual explanations the model generates.

Moreno", "Christine Damase-Michel", "Lynda Tamine"], "title": "ReToP: Learning to Rewrite Electronic Health Records for Clinical Prediction", "comment": "Accepted by WSDM 2026", "summary": "Electronic Health Records (EHRs) provide crucial information for clinical decision-making. However, their high-dimensionality, heterogeneity, and sparsity make clinical prediction challenging. Large Language Models (LLMs) allowed progress towards addressing this challenge by leveraging parametric medical knowledge to enhance EHR data for clinical prediction tasks. Despite the significant achievements made so far, most of the existing approaches are fundamentally task-agnostic in the sense that they deploy LLMs as EHR encoders or EHR completion modules without fully integrating signals from the prediction tasks. This naturally hinders task performance accuracy. In this work, we propose Rewrite-To-Predict (ReToP), an LLM-based framework that addresses this limitation through an end-to-end training of an EHR rewriter and a clinical predictor. To cope with the lack of EHR rewrite training data, we generate synthetic pseudo-labels using clinical-driven feature selection strategies to create diverse patient rewrites for fine-tuning the EHR rewriter. ReToP aligns the rewriter with prediction objectives using a novel Classifier Supervised Contribution (CSC) score that enables the EHR rewriter to generate clinically relevant rewrites that directly enhance prediction.

By mapping probability measures into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space via kernel mean embeddings, our method replaces Wasserstein metrics with an integral probability metric. This enables efficient estimation in multi-dimensional state-action spaces and reward settings, where direct computation of Wasserstein distances is computationally challenging. Theoretically, we establish contraction properties of the distributional Bellman operator under our proposed metric involving the Matern family of kernels and provide uniform convergence guarantees.

To address this, we propose the Guided Texture and Feature Modulation Network (GTFMN), a novel framework that decouples the LLSR task into two sub-problems: illumination estimation and texture restoration. First, our network employs a dedicated Illumination Stream whose purpose is to predict a spatially varying illumination map that accurately captures lighting distribution. Further, this map is utilized as an explicit guide within our novel Illumination Guided Modulation Block (IGM Block) to dynamically modulate features in the Texture Stream.

PALM modularizes the manipulation policy into coarse global components and a local policy for fine-grained actions. We reduce the discrepancy between in-domain and OOD inputs at the local policy level by enforcing local visual focus and consistent proprioceptive representation, allowing the policy to retrieve invariant local actions under OOD conditions.

We provide the first controlled, mechanism-level diagnostic study of whether synchronized iterative retrieval and reasoning can surpass an idealized static upper bound (Gold Context) RAG. We benchmark eleven state-of-the-art LLMs under three regimes: (i) No Context, measuring reliance on parametric memory; (ii) Gold Context, where all oracle evidence is supplied at once; and (iii) Iterative RAG, a training-free controller that alternates retrieval, hypothesis refinement, and evidence-aware stopping. Using the chemistry-focused ChemKGMultiHopQA dataset, we isolate questions requiring genuine retrieval and analyze behavior with diagnostics spanning retrieval coverage gaps, anchor-carry drop, query quality, composition fidelity, and control calibration. Across models, Iterative RAG consistently outperforms Gold Context, with gains up to 25.6 percentage points, especially for non-reasoning fine-tuned models. Staged retrieval reduces late-hop failures, mitigates context overload, and enables dynamic correction of early hypothesis drift, but remaining failure modes include incomplete hop coverage, distractor latch trajectories, early stopping miscalibration, and high composition failure rates even with perfect retrieval. Overall, staged retrieval is often more influential than the mere presence of ideal evidence; we provide practical guidance for deploying and diagnosing RAG systems in specialized scientific settings and a foundation for more reliable, controllable iterative retrieval-reasoning frameworks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u8fed\u4ee3\u5f0f\u68c0\u7d22-\u63a8\u7406\uff08Iterative RAG\uff09\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u7406\u60f3\u9759\u6001RAG\uff08Gold Context\uff09\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u5316\u5b66\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cIterative RAG\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eGold Context\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5bf9\u672a\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe25.6\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff1b\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u6e90\u4e8e\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u68c0\u7d22\u7f13\u89e3\u665a\u671f\u5931\u8d25\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8fc7\u8f7d\u4e0e\u5047\u8bbe\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u6709\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u5168\u3001\u5e72\u6270\u9879\u9501\u5b9a\u3001\u65e9\u505c\u8bef\u5224\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u5931\u8d25\u7b49\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RAG\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u5f02\u6784\u8bc1\u636e\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u8fed\u4ee3\u5f0f\u68c0\u7d22-\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u4f18\u4e8e\u9759\u6001RAG\uff1b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u673a\u5236\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e09\u7c7b\u57fa\u51c6\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff08\u65e0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001Gold Context\u3001Iterative RAG\uff09\uff0c\u5728ChemKGMultiHopQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u6d4b11\u4e2aSOTA LLM\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u9879\u8bca\u65ad\u6307\u6807\uff08\u68c0\u7d22\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u3001\u951a\u70b9\u4e22\u5931\u3001\u67e5\u8be2\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u7ec4\u5408\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u63a7\u5236\u6821\u51c6\u7b49\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u673a\u5236\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "Iterative RAG\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u8d85\u8d8aGold Context\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534725.6\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff1b\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u68c0\u7d22\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u665a\u671f\u5931\u8d25\u3001\u7f13\u89e3\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8fc7\u8f7d\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u4fee\u6b63\u65e9\u671f\u5047\u8bbe\u6f02\u79fb\uff1b\u4f46\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728hop\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u5168\u3001\u5e72\u6270\u9879\u9501\u5b9a\u3001\u65e9\u505c\u8bef\u5224\u53ca\u9ad8\u7ec4\u5408\u5931\u8d25\u7387\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": " staged retrieval\uff08\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u68c0\u7d22\uff09\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5e38\u8d85\u8fc7\u5355\u7eaf\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u60f3\u8bc1\u636e\uff1b\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57dfRAG\u90e8\u7f72\u4e0e\u8bca\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u5f0f\u68c0\u7d22-\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, most existing systems still rely on a fixed role library and an execution-frozen interaction topology, a rigid design choice that frequently leads to task mismatch, prevents timely adaptation when new evidence emerges during reasoning, and further inflates inference cost. We introduce MetaGen, a training-free framework that adapts both the role space and the collaboration topology at inference time, without updating base model weights.

While automated alignment routines exist, conventional approaches rely on serial, gradient-free searches (e.g., Nelder-Mead) that are sample-inefficient and struggle to correct multiple interacting parameters simultaneously. Conversely, emerging deep learning methods offer speed but often lack the flexibility to adapt to varying sample conditions without extensive retraining. Here, we introduce a Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) framework for rapid, data-efficient aberration correction. Importantly, this framework does not prescribe a single notion of image quality; instead, it enables user-defined, physically motivated reward formulations (e.g., symmetry-induced objectives) and uses Pareto fronts to expose the resulting trade-offs between competing experimental priorities. By using Gaussian Process regression to model the aberration landscape probabilistically, our workflow actively selects the most informative lens settings to evaluate next, rather than performing an exhaustive blind search. We demonstrate that this active learning loop is more robust than traditional optimization algorithms and effectively tunes focus, astigmatism, and higher-order aberrations.

This lightweight modification yields smoother latent trajectories and ensures high-fidelity structural preservation without requiring model tuning or inversion.

Each module consists of a parallelogram skeleton with a single centrally mounted actuator that enables folding and unfolding along its diagonal. The core design philosophy is to achieve essential MSRR functionalities such as morphing, docking, and locomotion with minimal control complexity. This enables a continuous and stable reconfiguration process that is independent of the surrounding medium, allowing the system to reliably form various configurations in diverse environments. To leverage the unique kinematics of Rhombot, we introduce morphpivoting, a novel motion primitive for reconfiguration that differs from advanced MSRR systems, and propose a strategy for its continuous execution. Finally, a series of physical experiments validate the module's stable reconfiguration ability, as well as its positional and docking accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aRhombot\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u5e73\u9762\u6676\u683c\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u81ea\u91cd\u6784\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u5176\u6a21\u5757\u5448\u83f1\u5f62\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e2a\u4e2d\u592e\u9a71\u52a8\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u6cbf\u5bf9\u89d2\u7ebf\u6298\u53e0/\u5c55\u5f00\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f4e\u63a7\u5236\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f62\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u5bf9\u63a5\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65b0\u8fd0\u52a8\u539f\u8bed'morphpivoting'\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u7a33\u5b9a\u91cd\u6784\u3001\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u5bf9\u63a5\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u81ea\u91cd\u6784\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff08MSRR\uff09\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u529f\u80fd\uff08\u5982\u5f62\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u5bf9\u63a5\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u63a7\u5236\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fde\u7eed\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u91cd\u6784\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u83f1\u5f62\u6a21\u5757\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u542b\u5e73\u884c\u56db\u8fb9\u5f62\u9aa8\u67b6\u548c\u5355\u4e2a\u4e2d\u592e\u6267\u884c\u5668\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6cbf\u5bf9\u89d2\u7ebf\u6298\u53e0/\u5c55\u5f00\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u8fd0\u52a8\u539f\u8bed'morphpivoting'\u53ca\u5176\u5b9e\u73b0\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u7269\u7406\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u5757\u5177\u5907\u7a33\u5b9a\u91cd\u6784\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u5bf9\u63a5\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "Rhombot\u4ee5\u6781\u7b80\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u65b0\u9896\u8fd0\u52a8\u539f\u8bed\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u4ecb\u8d28\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u81ea\u91cd\u6784\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684MSRR\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

However, applied mathematics problems in domains like finance, physics, and cryptography often require recalling or deriving governing equations, a step that current approaches do not explicitly leverage. We propose Formula-One Prompting (F-1), a two-phase approach that uses mathematical equations as an intermediate representation before adaptive solving. F-1 first formulates governing equations from problem descriptions, then selects a solving strategy among CoT, PoT, or direct computation based on the generated equations, all within a single LLM call. Results across five models and four benchmarks show F-1 outperforms CoT by +5.76% and PoT by +8.42% on average. Crucially, gains are largest in applied domains: +13.30% on FinanceMath over CoT, and within OlympiadBench, larger gains on physics (+2.55%) than pure math (+0.44%).

Model serving systems accept latency SLOs directly. LLM routers do not. They force operators to tune parameters offline and guess what accuracy might result. The relationship between parameters and outcomes is indirect, non-monotonic, and dataset-dependent. Operators need to specify accuracy targets, not infer them from opaque settings. We present PROTEUS (Polymorphic Router for Operational Target Enforcement with Unified SLA), a router that accepts accuracy targets tau as runtime input. PROTEUS uses Lagrangian dual control. A learned dual variable lambda tracks constraint violations during training and conditions the policy network. This lets the router translate specified tau values into routing decisions that satisfy them. A single trained model serves the full accuracy spectrum without retraining.We evaluate on RouterBench (11 models, 405K queries) and SPROUT (14 models, 45K queries). PROTEUS achieves consistent floor compliance where accuracy meets or exceeds tau. The target-response correlation reaches 0.97 to 0.98. The closest baseline, OmniRouter, meets floors only 22% of the time despite also using Lagrangian optimization. PROTEUS operates across tau in [0.85, 0.95] from a single model. On RouterBench it achieves 90.1% accuracy, within 1.3% of oracle. On SPROUT it achieves 94.0% accuracy, within 4.6% of oracle.

Scaling Laws for Meta-Learning in Quantum Control", "comment": "28 pages, 11 figures", "summary": "Quantum hardware suffers from intrinsic device heterogeneity and environmental drift, forcing practitioners to choose between suboptimal non-adaptive controllers or costly per-device recalibration. We derive a scaling law lower bound for meta-learning showing that the adaptation gain (expected fidelity improvement from task-specific gradient steps) saturates exponentially with gradient steps and scales linearly with task variance, providing a quantitative criterion for when adaptation justifies its overhead. Validation on quantum gate calibration shows negligible benefits for low-variance tasks but $>40\\%$ fidelity gains on two-qubit gates under extreme out-of-distribution conditions (10$\\times$ the training noise), with implications for reducing per-device calibration time on cloud quantum processors. Further validation on classical linear-quadratic control confirms these laws emerge from general optimization geometry rather than quantum-specific physics.

While test-time defenses are promising, existing methods fail to provide sufficient robustness against strong attacks and are often hampered by high inference latency and task-specific applicability. To address these limitations, we start by investigating the intrinsic properties of AEs, which reveals that AEs exhibit severe feature inconsistency under progressive frequency attenuation. We further attribute this to the model's inherent spectral bias. Leveraging this insight, we propose an efficient test-time defense named Contrastive Spectral Rectification (CSR). CSR optimizes a rectification perturbation to realign the input with the natural manifold under a spectral-guided contrastive objective, which is applied input-adaptively. Extensive experiments across 16 classification benchmarks demonstrate that CSR outperforms the SOTA by an average of 18.1% against strong AutoAttack with modest inference overhead. Furthermore, CSR exhibits broad applicability across diverse visual tasks.

In this framework, Catmull-Rom splines are utilized to characterize lane lines, and all the other ground markings are depicted using polygons uniformly. The results from instance segmentation serve as references to refine the three-dimensional position of spline control points and polygon corner points. In conjunction with this process, the homography matrix of IPM and vehicle poses are optimized simultaneously. Our proposed framework significantly reduces the mapping errors associated with IPM. It also improves the accuracy of the initial IPM homography matrix and the predicted vehicle poses. Furthermore, it addresses the limitations imposed by the coplanarity assumption in IPM. These enhancements enable IPM to be effectively applied to vectorized road mapping, which serves a cost-effective solution with enhanced accuracy. In addition, our framework generalizes road map elements to include all common ground markings and lane lines. The proposed framework is evaluated in two different practical scenarios, and the test results show that our method can automatically generate high-precision maps with near-centimeter-level accuracy.

However, its reliability is increasingly threatened by test set contamination, where test samples or their close variants leak into training data and artificially inflate reported performance. To address this issue, prior work has explored two main lines of mitigation. One line attempts to identify and remove contaminated benchmark items before evaluation, but this inevitably alters the evaluation set itself and becomes unreliable when contamination is moderate or severe. The other line preserves the benchmark and instead suppresses contaminated behavior at evaluation time; however, such interventions often interfere with normal inference and lead to noticeable performance degradation on clean inputs. We propose DeconIEP, a decontamination framework that operates entirely during evaluation by applying small, bounded perturbations in the input embedding space. Guided by a relatively less-contaminated reference model, DeconIEP learns an instance-adaptive perturbation generator that steers the evaluated model away from memorization-driven shortcut pathways. Across multiple open-weight LLMs and benchmarks, extensive empirical results show that DeconIEP achieves strong decontamination effectiveness while incurring only minimal degradation in benign utility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDeconIEP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u65bd\u52a0\u5c0f\u800c\u6709\u754c\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u6c61\u67d3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u6307\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u5b9e\u4f8b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u8bb0\u5fc6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6377\u5f84\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u5e72\u51c0\u6837\u672c\u7684\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u8bc4\u6d4b\u7684\u4e3b\u6d41\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u6c61\u67d3\uff08\u5373\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6837\u672c\u6216\u5176\u53d8\u4f53\u6cc4\u9732\u8fdb\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff09\u4e25\u91cd\u5a01\u80c1\u5176\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u865a\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDeconIEP\u53bb\u6c61\u67d3\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u9636\u6bb5\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u3001\u4e5f\u4e0d\u5e72\u9884\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e2a\u6c61\u67d3\u8f83\u8f7b\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u5d4c\u5165\u6270\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u65bd\u52a0\u5c0f\u4e14\u6709\u754c\u7684\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u88ab\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u907f\u5f00\u8bb0\u5fc6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6377\u5f84\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u6743\u91cdLLM\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cDeconIEP\u5728\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u53bb\u6c61\u67d3\u6548\u679c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4ec5\u5e26\u6765\u6781\u5c0f\u7684\u6b63\u5e38\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "DeconIEP\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4f4e\u4fb5\u5165\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u671f\u53bb\u6c61\u67d3\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u53bb\u6c61\u67d3\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u826f\u6027\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u79fb\u9664\u6c61\u67d3\u9879\u6216\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

To address this issue, we analyze the impact of different segments of the reasoning path on the correctness of the final result and, based on these insights, propose Reinforcement Fine-Tuning with Partial Reasoning Optimization (RPO), a plug-and-play reinforcement fine-tuning algorithm. Unlike traditional reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms that generate full reasoning paths, RPO trains the model by generating suffixes of the reasoning path using experience cache. During the rollout phase of training, RPO reduces token generation in this phase by approximately 95%, greatly lowering the theoretical time overhead. Compared with full-path reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms, RPO reduces the training time of the 1.5B model by 90% and the 7B model by 72%. At the same time, it can be integrated with typical algorithms such as GRPO and DAPO, enabling them to achieve training acceleration while maintaining performance comparable to the original algorithms.

As a result, this critical infrastructure is increasingly exposed to cyberattacks, including false data injection attacks (FDIAs) that compromise measurement integrity and threaten reliable system operation. Existing FDIA detection methods primarily exploit spatial correlations and network topology using graph-based learning; however, these approaches often rely on high-dimensional representations and shallow classifiers, limiting their ability to capture local structural dependencies and global contextual relationships. Moreover, naively incorporating Transformer architectures can result in overly deep models that struggle to model localized grid dynamics. This paper proposes a joint FDIA detection and localization framework that integrates auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) graph convolutional filters with an Encoder-Only Transformer architecture. The ARMA-based graph filters provide robust, topology-aware feature extraction and adaptability to abrupt spectral changes, while the Transformer encoder leverages self-attention to capture long-range dependencies among grid elements without sacrificing essential local context. The proposed method is evaluated using real-world load data from the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) applied to the IEEE 14- and 300-bus systems. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively exploits both the state and topology of the power grid, achieving high accuracy in detecting FDIA events and localizing compromised nodes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408ARMA\u56fe\u5377\u79ef\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u4e0eEncoder-Only Transformer\u7684\u8054\u5408\u865a\u5047\u6570\u636e\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb\uff08FDIA\uff09\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u7535\u7f51\u4e2d\u5bf9FDIA\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u8bbe\u5907\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u6269\u5927\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u653b\u51fb\u9762\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u865a\u5047\u6570\u636e\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb\uff08FDIA\uff09\u5a01\u80c1\u6d4b\u91cf\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u9760\u8fd0\u884c\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u5c40\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e14\u7eafTransformer\u6613\u5ffd\u7565\u5c40\u90e8\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u878d\u5408ARMA\u56fe\u5377\u79ef\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u4e0eEncoder-Only Transformer\u7684\u8054\u5408\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6846\u67b6\uff1aARMA\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u62d3\u6251\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5e76\u9002\u5e94\u9891\u8c31\u7a81\u53d8\uff1bTransformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5efa\u6a21\u7535\u7f51\u5143\u4ef6\u95f4\u7684\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u5173\u952e\u5c40\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728NYISO\u771f\u5b9e\u8d1f\u8377\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684IEEE 14\u8282\u70b9\u548c300\u8282\u70b9\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u7535\u7f51\u72b6\u6001\u4e0e\u62d3\u6251\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5728FDIA\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u88ab\u653b\u51fb\u8282\u70b9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86FDIA\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u7f51\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u517c\u5177\u5c40\u90e8\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

PCB inspection poses unique challenges due to densely packed components, complex wiring structures, and subtle defect patterns that require specialized domain expertise. However, a high-quality, unified vision-language benchmark for quantitatively evaluating MLLMs across PCB inspection tasks remains absent, stemming not only from limited data availability but also from fragmented datasets and inconsistent standardization. To fill this gap, we propose UniPCB, the first unified vision-language benchmark for open-ended PCB quality inspection. UniPCB is built via a systematic pipeline that curates and standardizes data from disparate sources across three annotated scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce PCB-GPT, an MLLM trained on a new instruction dataset generated by this pipeline, utilizing a novel progressive curriculum that mimics the learning process of human experts. Evaluations on the UniPCB benchmark show that while existing MLLMs falter on domain-specific tasks, PCB-GPT establishes a new baseline.

We observe that VLA inference exhibits structured redundancies across temporal, spatial, and depth dimensions, and that most existing efficiency methods ignore action context, despite its central role in embodied tasks. To address this gap, we propose Action-Context-aware Adaptive Computation for VLA models (AC^2-VLA), a unified framework that conditions computation on current visual observations, language instructions, and previous action states. Based on this action-centric context, AC^2-VLA adaptively performs cognition reuse across timesteps, token pruning, and selective execution of model components within a unified mechanism. To train the adaptive policy, we introduce an action-guided self-distillation scheme that preserves the behavior of the dense VLA policy while enabling structured sparsification that transfers across tasks and settings. Extensive experiments on robotic manipulation benchmarks show that AC^2-VLA achieves up to a 1.79\\times speedup while reducing FLOPs to 29.4% of the dense baseline, with comparable task success.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAC^2-VLA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eVLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u95ed\u73af\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u591a\u6570\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8fd9\u4e00\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAC^2-VLA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e\u5386\u53f2\u52a8\u4f5c\u72b6\u6001\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u65f6\u5e8f\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u590d\u7528\u3001token\u526a\u679d\u4e0e\u6a21\u5757\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6267\u884c\uff1b\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u52a8\u4f5c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u81ea\u84b8\u998f\u7b56\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cAC^2-VLA\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u9ad81.79\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0cFLOPs\u964d\u81f3\u7a20\u5bc6\u57fa\u7ebf\u768429.4%\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u662f\u63d0\u5347VLA\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0cAC^2-VLA\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8ba1\u7b97\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

A key contribution is a systematic robustness analysis to select a stable judge model. Crucially, the strong correlation between our reference-free and with-reference modes validates CEF's reliability without gold references.

Moreover, automating the purification process helps reduce the risk of worker harm by limiting human involvement. Crude oil contains acidic components such as hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, and other chemical compounds. During processing, these substances are partially released into sour water. If not properly treated, sour water poses serious environmental threats and accelerates the corrosion of pipelines and equipment. This paper presents a fuzzy expert system, combined with a custom-generated digital twin, developed from a documented industrial process to maintain key parameters at desired levels by mimicking human reasoning. The control strategy is designed to be simple and intuitive, allowing junior or non-expert personnel to interact with the system effectively. The digital twin was developed using Honeywell UniSim Design R492 to simulate real industrial behavior accurately. Valve dynamics were modeled through system identification in MATLAB, and real-time data exchange between the simulator and controller was established using OPC DA. The fuzzy controller applies split-range control to two valves and was tested under 21 different initial pressure conditions using five distinct defuzzification strategies, resulting in a total of 105 unique test scenarios.

However, most existing RL approaches rely on sparse outcome rewards, which fail to credit correct intermediate steps in partially successful solutions. Process reward models (PRMs) offer fine-grained step-level supervision, but their scores are often noisy and difficult to evaluate. As a result, recent PRM benchmarks focus on a more objective capability: detecting the first incorrect step in a reasoning path. However, this evaluation target is misaligned with how PRMs are typically used in RL, where their step-wise scores are treated as raw rewards to maximize. To bridge this gap, we propose Verifiable Prefix Policy Optimization (VPPO), which uses PRMs only to localize the first error during RL. Given an incorrect rollout, VPPO partitions the trajectory into a verified correct prefix and an erroneous suffix based on the first error, rewarding the former while applying targeted penalties only after the detected mistake. This design yields stable, interpretable learning signals and improves credit assignment. Across multiple reasoning benchmarks, VPPO consistently outperforms sparse-reward RL and prior PRM-guided baselines on both Pass@1 and Pass@K.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faVerifiable Prefix Policy Optimization (VPPO)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff08PRM\uff09\u4ec5\u5b9a\u4f4d\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u4e2d\u7684\u9996\u4e2a\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5c06\u8f68\u8ff9\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u5df2\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u524d\u7f00\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u540e\u7f00\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u522b\u7ed9\u4e88\u5956\u52b1\u4e0e\u60e9\u7f5a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6539\u5584\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u7ed3\u679c\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5956\u52b1\u90e8\u5206\u6210\u529f\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1b\u800c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff08PRM\uff09\u867d\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8bc4\u5206\u566a\u58f0\u5927\u3001\u96be\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e14\u5f53\u524dPRM\u8bc4\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u68c0\u6d4b\u9996\u4e2a\u9519\u8bef\uff09\u4e0eRL\u4e2d\u5c06\u5176\u5206\u6570\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u4f5c\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u9519\u4f4d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVPPO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5728RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ec5\u7528PRM\u5b9a\u4f4d\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u4e2d\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u9519\u8bef\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5c06\u8f68\u8ff9\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u2018\u5df2\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6b63\u786e\u524d\u7f00\u2019\u548c\u2018\u9519\u8bef\u540e\u7f00\u2019\uff0c\u5bf9\u524d\u7f00\u7ed9\u4e88\u6b63\u5411\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e4b\u540e\u65bd\u52a0\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u60e9\u7f5a\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528\u566a\u58f0PRM\u5206\u503c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9010\u6b65\u5956\u52b1\u3002", "result": "VPPO\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1RL\u53ca\u5148\u524dPRM\u5f15\u5bfc\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728Pass@1\u548cPass@K\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u6709\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "conclusion": "VPPO\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026PRM\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u529f\u80fd\u4e0e\u5956\u52b1\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u4e86PRM\u8bc4\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u4e0eRL\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u63a8\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Our method reframes segmentation as a simple sequence generation problem: the model directly predicts sequences of points (textual coordinates) delineating object boundaries, entirely within its language space. To achieve high fidelity, we introduce a two-stage SF$\\to$RL training pipeline, where Reinforcement Learning with an IoU-based reward refines the point sequences to accurately match ground-truth contours. We find that the standard MLLM architecture possesses a strong, inherent capacity for low-level perception that can be unlocked without any specialized architecture.

Each problem was audited to ensure LaTeX compilability, solvability and verifiability, which involved adding missing figures or information, labeling problems requiring a proof, estimation or image, and removing clutter. This process significantly reduces dataset-induced noise, thereby providing a more precise assessment of model performance. The annotated dataset also allows us to evaluate judge-induced noise by comparing GPT-5 mini with the original Omni-Judge, revealing substantial discrepancies between judges on both the clean and tagged problem subsets. Expert annotations reveal that Omni-Judge is wrong in $96.4\\%$ of the judge disagreements, indicating its inability to differentiate between models' abilities, even well before saturation of the benchmark occurs. As problems become more challenging, we find that increasingly competent judges become essential in order to prevent judge errors from masking genuine differences between models.

In our work, we introduce Video Connecting, an innovative task that aims to generate smooth intermediate video content between given start and end clips. However, the absence of standardized evaluation benchmarks has hindered the development of this task. To bridge this gap, we proposed VC-Bench, a novel benchmark specifically designed for video connecting. It includes 1,579 high-quality videos collected from public platforms, covering 15 main categories and 72 subcategories to ensure diversity and structure. VC-Bench focuses on three core aspects: Video Quality Score VQS, Start-End Consistency Score SECS, and Transition Smoothness Score TSS. Together, they form a comprehensive framework that moves beyond conventional quality-only metrics. We evaluated multiple state-of-the-art video generation models on VC-Bench. Experimental results reveal significant limitations in maintaining start-end consistency and transition smoothness, leading to lower overall coherence and fluidity.

Although recent large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong translation capabilities, their effectiveness for APE--especially under document-level context--remains insufficiently understood. We present a systematic comparison of proprietary and open-weight LLMs under a naive document-level prompting setup, analyzing APE quality, contextual behavior, robustness, and efficiency.\n  Our results show that proprietary LLMs achieve near human-level APE quality even with simple one-shot prompting, regardless of whether document context is provided. While these models exhibit higher robustness to data poisoning attacks than open-weight counterparts, this robustness also reveals a limitation: they largely fail to exploit document-level context for contextual error correction. Furthermore, standard automatic metrics do not reliably reflect these qualitative improvements, highlighting the continued necessity of human evaluation. Despite their strong performance, the substantial cost and latency overheads of proprietary LLMs render them impractical for real-world APE deployment. Overall, our findings elucidate both the promise and current limitations of LLM-based document-aware APE, and point toward the need for more efficient long-context modeling approaches for translation refinement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e13\u6709\u548c\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u6863\u7ea7\u81ea\u52a8\u540e\u7f16\u8f91\uff08APE\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u8d28\u91cf\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u6587\u6863\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8fdb\u884c\u7ea0\u9519\uff0c\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\uff1b\u81ea\u52a8\u6307\u6807\u65e0\u6cd5\u53ef\u9760\u53cd\u6620\u5176\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4ecd\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7ffb\u8bd1\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u6587\u6863\u7ea7\u81ea\u52a8\u540e\u7f16\u8f91\uff08APE\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5229\u7528\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u4e13\u6709\u548c\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u6587\u6863\u7ea7\u63d0\u793a\uff08one-shot prompting\uff09\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30APE\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u6297\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u653b\u51fb\u80fd\u529b\u53ca\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u4e13\u6709LLMs\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u5373\u8fbe\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7bAPE\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u5229\u7528\u6587\u6863\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff1b\u81ea\u52a8\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b\u5176\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u963b\u788d\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM-based\u6587\u6863\u7ea7APE\u6f5c\u529b\u5de8\u5927\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\u4f4e\u6548\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u53ca\u90e8\u7f72\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

As challenges remain in extracting 3D modal features and bridging the gap between different modalities, we propose TIGaussian, a framework that harnesses 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) characteristics to strengthen cross-modality alignment through multi-branch 3DGS tokenizer and modality-specific 3D feature alignment strategies. Specifically, our multi-branch 3DGS tokenizer decouples the intrinsic properties of 3DGS structures into compact latent representations, enabling more generalizable feature extraction. To further bridge the modality gap, we develop a bidirectional cross-modal alignment strategies: a multi-view feature fusion mechanism that leverages diffusion priors to resolve perspective ambiguity in image-3D alignment, while a text-3D projection module adaptively maps 3D features to text embedding space for better text-3D alignment.

ComAgent employs a closed-loop Perception-Planning-Action-Reflection cycle, coordinating specialized agents for literature search, coding, and scoring to autonomously generate solver-ready formulations and reproducible simulations. By iteratively decomposing problems and self-correcting errors, the framework effectively bridges the gap between user intent and execution. Evaluations demonstrate that ComAgent achieves expert-comparable performance in complex beamforming optimization and outperforms monolithic LLMs across diverse wireless tasks, highlighting its potential for automating design in emerging wireless networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faComAgent\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u591aLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u611f\u77e5-\u89c4\u5212-\u6267\u884c-\u53cd\u601d\u95ed\u73af\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5c06\u9ad8\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\u610f\u56fe\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u6c42\u89e3\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u4eff\u771f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u53476G\u8de8\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "6G\u7f51\u7edc\u4f9d\u8d56\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8de8\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u4eba\u5de5\u5c06\u9ad8\u5c42\u610f\u56fe\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6570\u5b66\u516c\u5f0f\u4ecd\u662f\u74f6\u9888\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9886\u57df\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u7ea6\u675f\u610f\u8bc6\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faComAgent\u591aLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u95ed\u73af\u7684\u611f\u77e5-\u89c4\u5212-\u6267\u884c-\u53cd\u601d\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u534f\u8c03\u6587\u732e\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u8bc4\u5206\u7b49\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u89e3\u4e0e\u81ea\u7ea0\u9519\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u4f18\u5316\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ea7\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4f53\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "ComAgent\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u4e0e\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u4e3a\u65b0\u5174\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

We introduce EVEREST, a transformer-based architecture for probabilistic rare-event forecasting that delivers calibrated predictions and tail-aware risk estimation, with auxiliary interpretability via attention-based signal attribution. EVEREST integrates four components: (i) a learnable attention bottleneck for soft aggregation of temporal dynamics; (ii) an evidential head for estimating aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty via a Normal--Inverse--Gamma distribution; (iii) an extreme-value head that models tail risk using a Generalized Pareto Distribution; and (iv) a lightweight precursor head for early-event detection. These modules are jointly optimized with a composite loss (focal loss, evidential NLL, and a tail-sensitive EVT penalty) and act only at training time; deployment uses a single classification head with no inference overhead (approximately 0.81M parameters). On a decade of space-weather data, EVEREST achieves state-of-the-art True Skill Statistic (TSS) of 0.973/0.970/0.966 at 24/48/72-hour horizons for C-class flares. The model is compact, efficient to train on commodity hardware, and applicable to high-stakes domains such as industrial monitoring, weather, and satellite diagnostics.

Detecting such fake content reliably is an urgent challenge. While deep learning approaches dominate current literature, handcrafted features remain attractive for their interpretability, efficiency, and generalizability. In this paper, we conduct a systematic evaluation of handcrafted descriptors, including raw pixels, color histograms, Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Local Binary Patterns (LBP), Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), and wavelet features, on the CIFAKE dataset of real versus synthetic images. Using 50,000 training and 10,000 test samples, we benchmark seven classifiers ranging from Logistic Regression to advanced gradient-boosted ensembles (LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost). Results demonstrate that LightGBM consistently outperforms alternatives, achieving PR-AUC 0.9879, ROC-AUC 0.9878, F1 0.9447, and a Brier score of 0.0414 with mixed features, representing strong gains in calibration and discrimination over simpler descriptors. Across three configurations (baseline, advanced, mixed), performance improves monotonically, confirming that combining diverse handcrafted features yields substantial benefit. These findings highlight the continued relevance of carefully engineered features and ensemble learning for detecting synthetic images, particularly in contexts where interpretability and computational efficiency are critical.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982DCT\u3001HOG\u3001LBP\u7b49\uff09\u5728CIFAKE\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u68c0\u6d4b\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LightGBM\u7ed3\u5408\u6df7\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5224\u522b\u529b\u548c\u826f\u597d\u6821\u51c6\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u624b\u5de5\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u96c6\u6210\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u654f\u611f\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u5ea6\u903c\u771f\u7684\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u6cdb\u6ee5\uff0c\u5a01\u80c1\u6570\u5b57\u5a92\u4f53\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff1b\u4e9f\u9700\u53ef\u9760\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u624b\u5de5\u7279\u5f81\u56e0\u5176\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4ecd\u5177\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5728CIFAKE\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e03\u79cd\u624b\u5de5\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u50cf\u7d20\u3001\u989c\u8272\u76f4\u65b9\u56fe\u3001DCT\u3001HOG\u3001LBP\u3001GLCM\u3001\u5c0f\u6ce2\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e03\u79cd\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff08\u4ece\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u5230LightGBM/XGBoost/CatBoost\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e09\u79cd\u7279\u5f81\u914d\u7f6e\uff08\u57fa\u7ebf\u3001\u9ad8\u7ea7\u3001\u6df7\u5408\uff09\u3002", "result": "LightGBM\u7ed3\u5408\u6df7\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff1aPR-AUC 0.9879\uff0cROC-AUC 0.9878\uff0cF1 0.9447\uff0cBrier\u5206\u65700.0414\uff1b\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u7279\u5f81\u7ec4\u5408\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u800c\u5355\u8c03\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u624b\u5de5\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662fLightGBM\uff09\u5728\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u4ecd\u5177\u5f3a\u5927\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5f3a\u8c03\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

This mixed-methods study (N = 201) examined how anthropomorphic levels and moral foundations shape reactions to robot abuse. Participants viewed videos depicting physical mistreatment of robots varying in humanness (Spider, Twofoot, Humanoid) and completed measures assessing moral foundations, anger, and social distance. Results revealed that anthropomorphism determines whether people extend moral consideration to robots, while moral foundations shape how they reason about such consideration. Qualitative analysis revealed distinct reasoning patterns: low-progressivism individuals employed character-based judgments, while high-progressivism individuals engaged in future-oriented moral deliberation.

While effective in monolingual settings, a single projector struggles to capture the diverse acoustic-to-semantic mappings required for multilingual ASR. To address this, we propose SMEAR-MoE, a stabilized Mixture-of-Experts projector that ensures dense gradient flow to all experts, preventing expert collapse while enabling cross-lingual sharing. We systematically compare monolithic, static multi-projector, and dynamic MoE designs across four Indic languages (Hindi, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu). Our SMEAR-MoE achieves strong performance, delivering upto a 7.6% relative WER reduction over the single-projector baseline, while maintaining comparable runtime efficiency. Analysis of expert routing further shows linguistically meaningful specialization, with related languages sharing experts.

The Limits of Microscaling Formats in Large Language Models", "comment": "31 pages, 17 figures, 3 tables; accepted to ICLR 2026", "summary": "Microscaling data formats leverage per-block tensor quantization to enable aggressive model compression with limited loss in accuracy. Unlocking their potential for efficient training and inference necessitates hardware-friendly implementations that handle matrix multiplications in a native format and adopt efficient error-mitigation strategies. Herein, we report the emergence of a surprising behavior associated with microscaling quantization, whereas the output of a quantized model degrades as block size is decreased below a given threshold. This behavior clashes with the expectation that a smaller block size should allow for a better representation of the tensor elements. We investigate this phenomenon both experimentally and theoretically, decoupling the sources of quantization error behind it. Experimentally, we analyze the distributions of several Large Language Models and identify the conditions driving the anomalous behavior. Theoretically, we lay down a framework showing remarkable agreement with experimental data from pretrained model distributions and ideal ones. Overall, we show that the anomaly is driven by the interplay between narrow tensor distributions and the limited dynamic range of the quantized scales. Based on these insights, we propose the use of FP8 unsigned E5M3 (UE5M3) as a novel hardware-friendly format for the scales in FP4 microscaling data types. We demonstrate that UE5M3 achieves comparable performance to the conventional FP8 unsigned E4M3 scales while obviating the need of global scaling operations on weights and activations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5fae\u7f29\u653e\u91cf\u5316\u4e2d\u5757\u5927\u5c0f\u51cf\u5c0f\u53cd\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u53cd\u76f4\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u5206\u6790\u5176\u6210\u56e0\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u7a84\u5f20\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u91cf\u5316\u5c3a\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u8303\u56f4\u53d7\u9650\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u662f\u4e3b\u56e0\uff1b\u8fdb\u800c\u63d0\u51fa\u91c7\u7528FP8 UE5M3\u683c\u5f0f\u4f5c\u4e3aFP4\u5fae\u7f29\u653e\u4e2d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u65b0\u786c\u4ef6\u53cb\u597d\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5168\u5c40\u7f29\u653e\u64cd\u4f5c\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edfE4M3\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fae\u7f29\u653e\u6570\u636e\u683c\u5f0f\u867d\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u53cb\u597d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5f53\u5757\u5c3a\u5bf8\u51cf\u5c0f\u65f6\u51fa\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u5f02\u5e38\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8fdd\u80cc\u5e38\u89c4\u8ba4\u77e5\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u591a\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5f02\u5e38\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u89e6\u53d1\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u6784\u5efa\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u8026\u91cf\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u63d0\u51faFP8 UE5M3\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8868\u793a\u7684\u65b0\u683c\u5f0f\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5fae\u7f29\u653e\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u5f02\u5e38\u4e0b\u964d\u6e90\u4e8e\u7a84\u5f20\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u91cf\u5316\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6709\u9650\u52a8\u6001\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff1bUE5M3\u683c\u5f0f\u5728\u4e0d\u5f15\u5165\u5168\u5c40\u7f29\u653e\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0eE4M3\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5fae\u7f29\u653e\u5e76\u975e\u8d8a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8d8a\u597d\uff0c\u5757\u5927\u5c0f\u5b58\u5728\u4e0b\u9650\uff1bUE5M3\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u4f18\u3001\u66f4\u786c\u4ef6\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u53ef\u7b80\u5316\u786c\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Due to the limited number of labeled samples in the target domain, there can be intrinsic similarity of classes in the feature space, which may result in biased predictions, even when the model is trained on a balanced dataset. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a multi-view consistency framework, which includes two views for training strongly augmented data. One is a debiasing strategy for correcting class-wise prediction probabilities according to the prediction performance of the model. The other involves leveraging pseudo-negative labels derived from the model predictions. Furthermore, we introduce a cross-domain affinity learning aimed at aligning features of the same class across different domains, thereby enhancing overall performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the competing methods on two standard domain adaptation datasets, DomainNet and Office-Home.

To detect hand coordination policies, we apply Shannon's information theory to analyze the information flow between scene elements and leverage scene graph properties.

This is particularly important because debunking false information typically takes longer to reach consumers than the misinformation itself; accelerating corrections through automation can therefore help counter it more effectively. Although many organizations perform manual fact-checking, this approach is difficult to scale given the growing volume of digital content. These limitations have motivated interest in automating fact-checking, where identifying claims is a crucial first step. However, progress has been uneven across languages, with English dominating due to abundant annotated data. Portuguese, like other languages, still lacks accessible, licensed datasets, limiting research, NLP developments and applications. In this paper, we introduce ClaimPT, a dataset of European Portuguese news articles annotated for factual claims, comprising 1,308 articles and 6,875 individual annotations. Unlike most existing resources based on social media or parliamentary transcripts, ClaimPT focuses on journalistic content, collected through a partnership with LUSA, the Portuguese News Agency.

Existing efforts to characterise agentic design patterns often lack a rigorous systems-theoretic foundation, resulting in high-level or convenience-based taxonomies that are difficult to implement. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a principled methodology for engineering robust AI agents. We propose two primary contributions: first, a novel system-theoretic framework that deconstructs an agentic AI system into five core, interacting functional subsystems: Reasoning & World Model, Perception & Grounding, Action Execution, Learning & Adaptation, and Inter-Agent Communication. Second, derived from this architecture and directly mapped to a comprehensive taxonomy of agentic challenges, we present a collection of 12 agentic design patterns. These patterns - categorised as Foundational, Cognitive & Decisional, Execution & Interaction, and Adaptive & Learning - offer reusable, structural solutions to recurring problems in agent design. The utility of the framework is demonstrated by a case study on the ReAct framework, showing how the proposed patterns can rectify systemic architectural deficiencies. This work provides a foundational language and a structured methodology to standardise agentic design communication among researchers and engineers, leading to more modular, understandable, and reliable autonomous systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bba\u7684AI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5de5\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e94\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u529f\u80fd\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u6784\u5efa\u4e8612\u79cd\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u53ca\u8bbe\u8ba1\u968f\u610f\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u89e3\u6784\u4e3a\u4e94\u4e2a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u529f\u80fd\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5e38\u89c1\u6311\u6218\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5f52\u7eb3\u51fa12\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b5\u4e2a\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c12\u79cd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7ReAct\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

In the classic setting of linear OPE, finite-sample guarantees often take the form $$ \\textrm{Evaluation error} \\le \\textrm{poly}(C^\u03c0, d, 1/n,\\log(1/\u03b4)), $$ where $d$ is the dimension of the features and $C^\u03c0$ is a coverage parameter that characterizes the degree to which the visited features lie in the span of the data distribution. While such guarantees are well-understood for several popular algorithms under stronger assumptions (e.g. Bellman completeness), the understanding is lacking and fragmented in the minimal setting where only the target value function is linearly realizable in the features. Despite recent interest in tight characterizations of the statistical rate in this setting, the right notion of coverage remains unclear, and candidate definitions from prior analyses have undesirable properties and are starkly disconnected from more standard definitions in the literature.\n  We provide a novel finite-sample analysis of a canonical algorithm for this setting, LSTDQ. Inspired by an instrumental-variable view, we develop error bounds that depend on a novel coverage parameter, the feature-dynamics coverage, which can be interpreted as linear coverage in an induced dynamical system for feature evolution. With further assumptions -- such as Bellman-completeness -- our definition successfully recovers the coverage parameters specialized to those settings, finally yielding a unified understanding for coverage in linear OPE.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08OPE\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u4e8eLSTDQ\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u91cf\u2014\u2014\u7279\u5f81\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u4ee5\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u540c\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7ebf\u6027OPE\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u4ec5\u5047\u8bbe\u76ee\u6807\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u8986\u76d6\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u6e05\u6670\u3001\u4e0d\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u4e14\u5df2\u6709\u5b9a\u4e49\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u9677\u5e76\u8131\u79bb\u6807\u51c6\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5de5\u5177\u53d8\u91cf\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5bf9\u7ecf\u5178LSTDQ\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u65b0\u578b\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u2018\u7279\u5f81-\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8986\u76d6\u2019\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b0\u8986\u76d6\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u523b\u753b\u7279\u5f81\u6f14\u5316\u6240\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u8986\u76d6\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81-\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u65b0\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\uff1b\u5728\u9644\u52a0\u5047\u8bbe\uff08\u5982Bellman\u5b8c\u5907\u6027\uff09\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u5b9a\u4e49\u80fd\u81ea\u7136\u9000\u5316\u4e3a\u5bf9\u5e94\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u8986\u76d6\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8986\u76d6\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7279\u5f81-\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8986\u76d6\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027OPE\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u672c\u8d28\u3001\u66f4\u666e\u9002\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u523b\u753b\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u5efa\u6a21\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u5bf9\u7edf\u8ba1\u901f\u7387\u7684\u7d27\u81f4\u523b\u753b\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u7edf\u4e00\u3002"}}

These effects are difficult to reproduce digitally due to the complex behavior of light diffusion. We present ProMist-5K, a dataset designed to support cinematic style emulation. It is built using a physically inspired pipeline in a scene-referred linear space and includes 20,000 high-resolution image pairs across four configurations, covering two filter densities (1/2 and 1/8) and two focal lengths (20mm and 50mm). Unlike general style datasets, ProMist-5K focuses on realistic glow and highlight diffusion effects. Multiple blur layers and carefully tuned weighting are used to model the varying intensity and spread of optical diffusion. The dataset provides a consistent and controllable target domain that supports various image translation models and learning paradigms.

Structured pruning methods are primarily employed to improve the inference efficiency of pre-trained models. Meanwhile, they often require additional time and memory for training, knowledge distillation, structure search, and other strategies, making efficient model fine-tuning challenging to achieve. To simultaneously enhance the training and inference efficiency of downstream task fine-tuning, we introduce GradPruner, which can prune layers of LLMs guided by gradients in the early stages of fine-tuning. GradPruner uses the cumulative gradients of each parameter during the initial phase of fine-tuning to compute the Initial Gradient Information Accumulation Matrix (IGIA-Matrix) to assess the importance of layers and perform pruning. We sparsify the pruned layers based on the IGIA-Matrix and merge them with the remaining layers. Only elements with the same sign are merged to reduce interference from sign variations. We conducted extensive experiments on two LLMs across eight downstream datasets. Including medical, financial, and general benchmark tasks. The results demonstrate that GradPruner has achieved a parameter reduction of 40% with only a 0.99% decrease in accuracy.

However, existing activation safety approaches, trained on broad misuse datasets, struggle with poor precision, limited flexibility, and lack of interpretability. This paper introduces a new paradigm: rule-based activation safety, inspired by rule-sharing practices in cybersecurity. We propose modeling activations as cognitive elements (CEs), fine-grained, interpretable factors such as ''making a threat'' and ''payment processing'', that can be composed to capture nuanced, domain-specific behaviors with higher precision. Building on this representation, we present a practical framework that defines predicate rules over CEs and detects violations in real time.

Statistical fairness measures belong to an important category of technical/formal mechanisms for detecting fairness issues in data and algorithms. In this contribution we study the relations between two types of statistical fairness measures namely Statistical-Parity and Equalized-Odds. The Statistical-Parity measure does not rely on having ground truth, i.e., (objectively) labeled target attributes. This makes Statistical-Parity a suitable measure in practice for assessing fairness in data and data classification algorithms. Therefore, Statistical-Parity is adopted in many legal and professional frameworks for assessing algorithmic fairness. The Equalized-Odds measure, on the contrary, relies on having (reliable) ground-truth, which is not always feasible in practice. Nevertheless, there are several situations where the Equalized-Odds definition should be satisfied to enforce false prediction parity among sensitive social groups. We present a novel analyze of the relation between Statistical-Parity and Equalized-Odds, depending on the base-rates of sensitive groups. The analysis intuitively shows how and when base-rate imbalance causes incompatibility between Statistical-Parity and Equalized-Odds measures. As such, our approach provides insight in (how to make design) trade-offs between these measures in practice. Further, based on our results, we plea for examining base-rate (im)balance and investigating the possibility of such an incompatibility before enforcing or relying on the Statistical-Parity criterion. The insights provided, we foresee, may trigger initiatives to improve or adjust the current practice and/or the existing legal frameworks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7edf\u8ba1\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e2d\u7edf\u8ba1\u5747\u7b49\uff08Statistical-Parity\uff09\u4e0e\u673a\u4f1a\u5747\u7b49\uff08Equalized-Odds\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4e8c\u8005\u5728\u654f\u611f\u7fa4\u4f53\u57fa\u7387\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5185\u5728\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u9700\u9884\u5148\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u7387\u5dee\u5f02\u53ca\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7edf\u8ba1\u5747\u7b49\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7528\u4e8e\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4e0e\u884c\u4e1a\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u800c\u673a\u4f1a\u5747\u7b49\u4f9d\u8d56\u53ef\u9760\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u66f4\u5fc5\u8981\u3002\u4e8c\u8005\u9002\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5173\u7cfb\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u6670\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u57fa\u7387\u5931\u8861\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7406\u8bba\u5398\u6e05\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u7edf\u8ba1\u5747\u7b49\u4e0e\u673a\u4f1a\u5747\u7b49\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u654f\u611f\u7fa4\u4f53\u57fa\u7387\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u57fa\u7387\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5982\u4f55\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e8c\u8005\u4e0d\u53ef\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5f53\u654f\u611f\u7fa4\u4f53\u57fa\u7387\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5747\u7b49\u4e0e\u673a\u4f1a\u5747\u7b49\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5171\u5b58\uff1b\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u4e8c\u8005\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u5145\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b\u6307\u51fa\u5728\u57fa\u7387\u5931\u8861\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5f3a\u884c\u8981\u6c42\u7edf\u8ba1\u5747\u7b49\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fdd\u80cc\u516c\u5e73\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e94\u4f18\u5148\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u654f\u611f\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u57fa\u7387\u5e73\u8861\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u524d\u5224\u65ad\u7edf\u8ba1\u5747\u7b49\u4e0e\u673a\u4f1a\u5747\u7b49\u662f\u5426\u517c\u5bb9\uff1b\u8be5\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u8df5\u3001\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u53ca\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6846\u67b6\u4f18\u5316\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u6307\u5bfc\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Thus, they may fail to keep pace with rapidly evolving models and emerging risks. To address these limitations, we propose VLSafetyBencher, the first automated system for LVLM safety benchmarking.

However, monocular camera-based 3D detection suffers from depth ambiguity and reduced robustness under challenging conditions. Radar provides complementary advantages such as resilience to poor lighting and adverse weather, but its sparsity and low resolution limit its direct use in detection frameworks. This motivates the need for effective Radar-camera fusion with improved preprocessing and depth estimation strategies. We propose an end-to-end framework that enhances monocular 3D object detection through two key components. First, we introduce InstaRadar, an instance segmentation-guided expansion method that leverages pre-trained segmentation masks to enhance Radar density and semantic alignment, producing a more structured representation. InstaRadar achieves state-of-the-art results in Radar-guided depth estimation, showing its effectiveness in generating high-quality depth features. Second, we integrate the pre-trained RCDPT into the BEVDepth framework as a replacement for its depth module. With InstaRadar-enhanced inputs, the RCDPT integration consistently improves 3D detection performance. Overall, these components yield steady gains over the baseline BEVDepth model, demonstrating the effectiveness of InstaRadar and the advantage of explicit depth supervision in 3D object detection. Although the framework lags behind Radar-camera fusion models that directly extract BEV features, since Radar serves only as guidance rather than an independent feature stream, this limitation highlights potential for improvement.

OATS leverages valuable training samples as principled guiding signals and dynamically generates high-quality synthetic data conditioned on them. We further design a diffusion-based framework to produce realistic time series and introduce an explore-exploit mechanism to balance efficiency and effectiveness.

We present the first systematic zero-shot evaluation of eight stereo methods spanning iterative refinement, foundation model, diffusion-based, and 3D CNN paradigms. All methods use officially released pretrained weights (trained on Scene Flow) and are evaluated on four standard benchmarks (ETH3D, KITTI 2012/2015, Middlebury) plus a novel 5,313-pair Canterbury Tree Branches dataset ($1920 \\times 1080$). Results reveal scene-dependent patterns: foundation models excel on structured scenes (BridgeDepth: 0.23 px on ETH3D; DEFOM: 4.65 px on Middlebury), while iterative methods show variable cross-benchmark performance (IGEV++: 0.36 px on ETH3D but 6.77 px on Middlebury; IGEV: 0.33 px on ETH3D but 4.99 px on Middlebury). Qualitative evaluation on the Tree Branches dataset establishes DEFOM as the gold-standard baseline for vegetation depth estimation, with superior cross-domain consistency (consistently ranking 1st-2nd across benchmarks, average rank 1.75).

However, scaling such refinement to naturalistic NLI remains difficult: long, syntactically rich inputs and deep multi-step arguments amplify autoformalisation errors, where a single local mismatch can invalidate the proof. Moreover, current methods often handle failures via costly global regeneration due to the difficulty of localising the responsible span or step from prover diagnostics. Aiming to address these problems, we propose a decompose-and-formalise framework that (i) decomposes premise-hypothesis pairs into an entailment tree of atomic steps, (ii) verifies the tree bottom-up to isolate failures to specific nodes, and (iii) performs local diagnostic-guided refinement instead of regenerating the whole explanation. Moreover, to improve faithfulness of autoformalisation, we introduce $\u03b8$-substitution in an event-based logical form to enforce consistent argument-role bindings. Across a range of reasoning tasks using five LLM backbones, our method achieves the highest explanation verification rates, improving over the state-of-the-art by 26.2%, 21.7%, 21.6% and 48.9%, while reducing refinement iterations and runtime and preserving strong NLI accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u89e3-\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\uff08NLI\uff09\u4e2d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5b9a\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\u5668\u8054\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u8574\u542b\u6811\u3001\u81ea\u5e95\u5411\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53ca\u5c40\u90e8\u8bca\u65ad\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u89e3\u91ca\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7387\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e0e\u8fd0\u884c\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u81ea\u7136\u5316NLI\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u957f\u800c\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u81ea\u52a8\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9519\u8bef\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u5931\u8d25\u5b9a\u4f4d\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5e38\u9700\u4ee3\u4ef7\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u91cd\u751f\u6210\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u89e3-\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff1a(i) \u5c06\u524d\u63d0-\u5047\u8bbe\u5bf9\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u8574\u542b\u6811\uff08\u542b\u539f\u5b50\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff09\uff1b(ii) \u81ea\u5e95\u5411\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4ee5\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5931\u8d25\u8282\u70b9\uff1b(iii) \u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9a\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\u5668\u8bca\u65ad\u8fdb\u884c\u5c40\u90e8\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316\u4fee\u6b63\uff1b\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u903b\u8f91\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u03b8-\u66ff\u6362\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u8bba\u5143\u89d2\u8272\u7ed1\u5b9a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u79cdLLM\u4e3b\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u9ad8\u89e3\u91ca\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7387\uff0c\u8f83SOTA\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u534726.2%\u300121.7%\u300121.6%\u548c48.9%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u7ec6\u5316\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\u4e0e\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3aNLI\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u89e3-\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u8bca\u65ad\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u81ea\u52a8\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0e\u5931\u8d25\u5b9a\u4f4d\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u5316NLI\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

This deployment data is naturally generated by users in applications such as LLMs-based writing assistants and coding agents. The _natural_ origin of user edits makes it a desired source for adapting and personalizing LLMs. In this setup, there emerges a unification of various feedback types namely preferences, supervised labels, and cost that are typically studied separately in the literature. In this paper, we initiate the theoretical investigation of learning from user edits. We first derive bounds for learning algorithms that learn from each of these feedback types. We prove that these algorithms have different trade-offs depending upon the user, data distribution, and model class.

Conventional training treats all pixels equally, leading to unstable optimization during early epochs when predictions are unreliable. We argue that this instability hinders convergence toward Pareto-optimal solutions and propose a region-wise curriculum strategy that prioritizes learning from certain regions and gradually incorporates uncertain ones, reducing gradient variance. Methodologically, we introduce a Pareto-consistent loss that balances trade-offs between regional uncertainties by adaptively reshaping the loss landscape and constraining convergence dynamics between interior and boundary regions; this guides the model toward Pareto-approximate solutions. To address boundary ambiguity, we further develop a fuzzy labeling mechanism that maintains binary confidence in non-boundary areas while enabling smooth transitions near boundaries, stabilizing gradients, and expanding flat regions in the loss surface. Experiments on brain metastasis and non-metastatic tumor segmentation show consistent improvements across multiple configurations, with our method outperforming traditional crisp-set approaches in all tumor subregions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u533a\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u4e0ePareto\u4e00\u81f4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u7cca\u6807\u6ce8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u8fb9\u754c\u533a\u57df\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9ad8\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u80bf\u7624\u4e9a\u533a\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u8fb9\u754c\u533a\u57df\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8fdc\u9ad8\u4e8e\u5185\u90e8\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u50cf\u7d20\u4e00\u89c6\u540c\u4ec1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u6a21\u578b\u6536\u655b\u81f3Pareto\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u533a\u57df-wise\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u5b66\u4e60\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9ad8\u7684\u533a\u57df\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1Pareto-consistent\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cd\u5851\u635f\u5931\u66f2\u9762\u5e76\u7ea6\u675f\u5185\u5916\u533a\u57df\u7684\u6536\u655b\u52a8\u6001\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u6a21\u7cca\u6807\u6ce8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u8fb9\u754c\u533a\u4fdd\u6301\u4e8c\u503c\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u8fb9\u754c\u533a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fc7\u6e21\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u68af\u5ea6\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u635f\u5931\u66f2\u9762\u5e73\u5766\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8111\u8f6c\u79fb\u7624\u4e0e\u975e\u8f6c\u79fb\u6027\u80bf\u7624\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u4e00\u81f4\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u6240\u6709\u80bf\u7624\u4e9a\u533a\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u660e\u786e\u96c6\uff08crisp-set\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u533a\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u3001Pareto\u4e00\u81f4\u635f\u5931\u4e0e\u6a21\u7cca\u6807\u6ce8\u4e09\u8005\u534f\u540c\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u5730\u903c\u8fd1Pareto\u6700\u4f18\u5206\u5272\u89e3\u3002"}}

However, their reliance on autoregressive inference, which generates outputs sequentially, creates a significant efficiency bottleneck, especially as KIE tasks often involve extracting multiple, semantically independent fields. To overcome this limitation, we introduce PIP: a Parallel Inference Paradigm for KIE. Our approach reformulates the problem by using \"[mask]\" tokens as placeholders for all target values, enabling their simultaneous generation in a single forward pass. To facilitate this paradigm, we develop a tailored mask pre-training strategy and construct large-scale supervised datasets.

Recent advances in AI, particularly chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, approximate such human cognitive abilities, where world models are believed to be embedded within large language models. Expert-level performance in formal and abstract domains such as mathematics and programming has been achieved in current systems by relying predominantly on verbal reasoning. However, they still lag far behind humans in domains like physical and spatial intelligence, which require richer representations and prior knowledge. The emergence of unified multimodal models (UMMs) capable of both verbal and visual generation has therefore sparked interest in more human-like reasoning grounded in complementary multimodal pathways, though their benefits remain unclear. From a world-model perspective, this paper presents the first principled study of when and how visual generation benefits reasoning. Our key position is the visual superiority hypothesis: for certain tasks--particularly those grounded in the physical world--visual generation more naturally serves as world models, whereas purely verbal world models encounter bottlenecks arising from representational limitations or insufficient prior knowledge. Theoretically, we formalize internal world modeling as a core component of CoT reasoning and analyze distinctions among different forms of world models. Empirically, we identify tasks that necessitate interleaved visual-verbal CoT reasoning, constructing a new evaluation suite, VisWorld-Eval. Controlled experiments on a state-of-the-art UMM show that interleaved CoT significantly outperforms purely verbal CoT on tasks that favor visual world modeling, but offers no clear advantage otherwise. Together, this work clarifies the potential of multimodal world modeling for more powerful, human-like multimodal AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u89c6\u89c9\u4f18\u52bf\u5047\u8bf4\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5728\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u6bd4\u7eaf\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5185\u90e8\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u65b0\u8bc4\u6d4b\u96c6VisWorld-Eval\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u56fe\u6587\u4ea4\u66ff\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eaf\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u7f16\u7a0b\u7b49\u62bd\u8c61\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7269\u7406\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\u7b49\u9700\u4e30\u5bcc\u8868\u5f81\u4e0e\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u9886\u57df\u8fdc\u900a\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\uff1b\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff08UMMs\uff09\u867d\u652f\u6301\u56fe\u6587\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u589e\u76ca\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u89c6\u89d2\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u5efa\u6a21\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u89c6\u89c9\u4f18\u52bf\u5047\u8bf4\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u4e13\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u56fe\u6587\u4ea4\u66ff\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u65b0\u8bc4\u6d4b\u96c6VisWorld-Eval\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5148\u8fdbUMM\u4e0a\u5f00\u5c55\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u56fe\u6587\u4ea4\u66ff\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u4f9d\u8d56\u89c6\u89c9\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eaf\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u65e0\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u52bf\uff1b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\uff09\u662f\u63d0\u5347AI\u7269\u7406\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7c7b\u4eba\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8def\u5f84\uff1b\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001AI\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

A thermodynamic limit is a continuous neural network, where the neurons form a continuous space with infinitely many points. We show that such a network admits a unique state in a certain region of the parameter space, which depends continuously on the parameters. This state breaks into an infinite number of states outside the mentioned region of parameter space. Then, the critical organization is a bifurcation in the parameter space, where a network transitions from a unique state to infinitely many states. We use p-adic integers to codify hierarchical structures. Indeed, we present an algorithm that recasts the hierarchical topologies used in DNNs and RNNs as p-adic tree-like structures. In this framework, the hierarchical and the critical organizations are connected. We study rigorously the critical organization of a toy model, a hierarchical edge detector for grayscale images based on p-adic cellular neural networks. The critical organization of such a network can be described as a strange attractor. In the second part, we study random versions of DNNs and RNNs. In this case, the network parameters are generalized Gaussian random variables in a space of quadratic integrable functions.

To establish a comprehensive open-access dermatopathology dataset for educational, cross-referencing, and machine-learning purposes, we employed a hybrid workflow to curate and categorize images from the PubMed Central (PMC) repository. We used specific keywords to extract relevant images, and classified them using a novel hybrid method that combined deep learning-based image modality classification with figure caption analyses. Validation on 651 manually annotated images demonstrated the robustness of our workflow, with an F-score of 89.6\\% for the deep learning approach, 61.0\\% for the keyword-based retrieval method, and 90.4\\% for the hybrid approach. We retrieved over 7,772 images across 166 diagnoses and released this fully annotated dataset, reviewed by board-certified dermatopathologists. Using our dataset as a challenging task, we found the current image analysis algorithm from OpenAI inadequate for analyzing dermatopathology images.

Winner-take-all circuits and time-to-first-spike coding implicitly treat when a neuron fires as an expression of confidence. We apply this principle to ensembles of Tiny Recursive Models (TRM). By basing the ensemble prediction solely on the first to halt rather than averaging predictions, we achieve 97.2% puzzle accuracy on Sudoku-Extreme while using 10x less compute than test-time augmentation (the baseline achieves 86.1% single-pass, 97.3% with TTA). Inference speed is an implicit indication of confidence. But can this capability be manifested as a training-only cost? Evidently yes: by maintaining K = 4 parallel latent states during training but backpropping only through the lowest-loss \"winner,\" a single model achieves 96.9% +/- 0.6% puzzle accuracy with a single forward pass-matching TTA performance without any test-time augmentation. As in nature, this work was also resource constrained: all experimentation used a single RTX 5090. This necessitated efficiency and compelled our invention of a modified SwiGLU which made Muon viable. With Muon and K = 1 training, we exceed TRM baseline performance in 7k steps (40 min).

Commonly used exploration strategies in reinforcement learning are largely undirected with sharp degradation as action dimensionality grows. Many existing methods resort to dimensionality reduction, which constrains policy expressiveness and forfeits system flexibility. We introduce Q-guided Flow Exploration (Qflex), a scalable reinforcement learning method that conducts exploration directly in the native high-dimensional action space. During training, Qflex traverses actions from a learnable source distribution along a probability flow induced by the learned value function, aligning exploration with task-relevant gradients rather than isotropic noise. Our proposed method substantially outperforms representative online reinforcement learning baselines across diverse high-dimensional continuous-control benchmarks. Qflex also successfully controls a full-body human musculoskeletal model to perform agile, complex movements, demonstrating superior scalability and sample efficiency in very high-dimensional settings.

Despite these advantages, there is a critical instability in DLMs: the moving sink phenomenon. Our analysis indicates that sink tokens exhibit low-norm representations in the Transformer's value space, and that the moving sink phenomenon serves as a protective mechanism in DLMs to prevent excessive information mixing. However, their unpredictable positions across diffusion steps undermine inference robustness. To resolve this, we propose a simple but effective extra sink token implemented via a modified attention mask. Specifically, we introduce a special token constrained to attend solely to itself, while remaining globally visible to all other tokens. Experimental results demonstrate that introducing a single extra token stabilizes attention sinks, substantially improving model performance. Crucially, further analysis confirms that the effectiveness of this token is independent of its position and characterized by negligible semantic content, validating its role as a robust and dedicated structural sink.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e00\u4e2a\u7279\u6b8a\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u989d\u5916'sink' token\u6765\u7a33\u5b9a\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08DLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u2018\u79fb\u52a8sink\u2019\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08DLMs\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u2018\u79fb\u52a8sink\u2019\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5373\u4f4e\u8303\u6570\u7684sink token\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6269\u6563\u6b65\u4e2d\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u635f\u5bb3\u63a8\u7406\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8be5\u73b0\u8c61\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u4fdd\u62a4\u4f5c\u7528\uff08\u9632\u6b62\u4fe1\u606f\u8fc7\u5ea6\u6df7\u5408\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e9f\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u989d\u5916\u7684sink token\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6539\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a9\u7801\u4f7f\u5176\u4ec5\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u3001\u4f46\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u5176\u4ed6token\u5168\u5c40\u53ef\u89c1\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u4e2d\u6027\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316sink\u3002", "result": "\u4ec5\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e00\u4e2a\u989d\u5916sink token\u5373\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u7a33\u5b9aattention sink\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u63d0\u5347DLM\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5token\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u5176\u4f4d\u7f6e\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u4e14\u51e0\u4e4e\u65e0\u8bed\u4e49\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u786e\u8bc1\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u6027sink\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7b80\u5355\u800c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316sink\u673a\u5236\u4e3aDLMs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4fdd\u969c\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u6ce8\u610f\u529bsink\u5bf9\u6269\u6563\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eedDLM\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

This method bridges progressive training paradigm with the phenomenon of redundant QK (or KV ) activations across deeper layers of transformers. EPAS gradually grows a sharing region during training by switching decoder layers to activation sharing mode. This results in throughput increase due to reduced compute. To utilize deeper layer redundancy, the sharing region starts from the deep end of the model and grows towards the shallow end. The EPAS trained models allow for variable region lengths of activation sharing for different compute budgets during inference. Empirical evaluations with QK activation sharing in LLaMA models ranging from 125M to 7B parameters show up to an 11.1% improvement in training throughput and up to a 29% improvement in inference throughput while maintaining similar loss curve to the baseline models.

This limitation stems from existing AIGI detection benchmarks, which, despite featuring a broad collection of synthetic images, remain restricted in their coverage of artifact diversity and lack detailed, localized annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce a fine-grained benchmark towards eXplainable AI-Generated image Detection, named X-AIGD, which provides pixel-level, categorized annotations of perceptual artifacts, spanning low-level distortions, high-level semantics, and cognitive-level counterfactuals. These comprehensive annotations facilitate fine-grained interpretability evaluation and deeper insight into model decision-making processes. Our extensive investigation using X-AIGD provides several key insights: (1) Existing AIGI detectors demonstrate negligible reliance on perceptual artifacts, even at the most basic distortion level.

A promising direction, grounded in human development, investigates agents that learn by setting and pursuing their own goals. The core challenge lies in how to effectively generate, select, and learn from such goals. Our focus is on broad distributions of downstream tasks where solving every task zero-shot is infeasible. Such settings naturally arise when the target tasks lie outside of the pre-training distribution or when their identities are unknown to the agent. In this work, we (i) optimize for efficient multi-episode exploration and adaptation within a meta-learning framework, and (ii) guide the training curriculum with evolving estimates of the agent's post-adaptation performance. We present ULEE, an unsupervised meta-learning method that combines an in-context learner with an adversarial goal-generation strategy that maintains training at the frontier of the agent's capabilities. On XLand-MiniGrid benchmarks, ULEE pre-training yields improved exploration and adaptation abilities that generalize to novel objectives, environment dynamics, and map structures.

To this end, we propose a cooperative-competitive learning approach termed \\emph{differentially private synthetic distillation} that learns to convert a pretrained model (teacher) into its privacy-preserving counterpart (student) via a trainable generator without access to private data. The learning collaborates with three players in a unified framework and performs alternate optimization: i)~the generator is learned to generate synthetic data, ii)~the teacher and student accept the synthetic data and compute differential private labels by flexible data or label noisy perturbation, and iii)~the student is updated with noisy labels and the generator is updated by taking the student as a discriminator for adversarial training. We theoretically prove that our approach can guarantee differential privacy and convergence.

Despite the promise of leveraging 2D diffusion priors, existing methods suffer from spatial blindness and rely on predefined trajectories that fail to exploit the inner relationships among salient objects. Consequently, these approaches are unable to comprehend the semantic layout, preventing them from exploring the scene adaptively to infer occluded content. Moreover, current inpainting models operate in 2D image space, struggling to plausibly fill holes caused by camera motion. To address these limitations, we propose RoamScene3D, a novel framework that bridges the gap between semantic guidance and spatial generation. Our method reasons about the semantic relations among objects and produces consistent and photorealistic scenes. Specifically, we employ a vision-language model (VLM) to construct a scene graph that encodes object relations, guiding the camera to perceive salient object boundaries and plan an adaptive roaming trajectory. Furthermore, to mitigate the limitations of static 2D priors, we introduce a Motion-Injected Inpainting model that is fine-tuned on a synthetic panoramic dataset integrating authentic camera trajectories, making it adaptive to camera motion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that with semantic reasoning and geometric constraints, our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in producing consistent and photorealistic scenes.

Firstly, we remove high-dimensional 15-degree-of-freedom drift and planar degeneracy from VGGT-SLAM by creating a new factor graph design while still addressing the reconstruction ambiguity of VGGT given unknown camera intrinsics. Secondly, by studying the attention layers of VGGT, we show that one of the layers is well suited to assist in image retrieval verification for free without additional training, which enables both rejecting false positive matches and allows for completing more loop closures. Finally, we conduct a suite of experiments which includes showing VGGT-SLAM 2.0 can easily be adapted for open-set object detection and demonstrating real time performance while running online onboard a ground robot using a Jetson Thor. We also test in environments ranging from cluttered indoor apartments and office scenes to a 4,200 square foot barn, and we also demonstrate VGGT-SLAM 2.0 achieves the highest accuracy on the TUM dataset with about 23 percent less pose error than VGGT-SLAM.

We ask whether LLMs can be systematically manipulated to reproduce language-production impairments characteristic of aphasia following focal brain lesions. Such models could provide scalable proxies for testing rehabilitation hypotheses, and offer a controlled framework for probing the functional organization of language. We introduce a clinically grounded, component-level framework that simulates aphasia by selectively perturbing functional components in LLMs, and apply it to both modular Mixture-of-Experts models and dense Transformers using a unified intervention interface. Our pipeline (i) identifies subtype-linked components for Broca's and Wernicke's aphasia, (ii) interprets these components with linguistic probing tasks, and (iii) induces graded impairments by progressively perturbing the top-k subtype-linked components, evaluating outcomes with Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) subtests summarized by Aphasia Quotient (AQ). Across architectures and lesioning strategies, subtype-targeted perturbations yield more systematic, aphasia-like regressions than size-matched random perturbations, and MoE modularity supports more localized and interpretable phenotype-to-component mappings. These findings suggest that modular LLMs, combined with clinically informed component perturbations, provide a promising platform for simulating aphasic language production and studying how distinct language functions degrade under targeted disruptions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4e34\u5e8a\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7ea7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6270\u52a8\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u5931\u8bed\u75c7\uff08\u5982\u5e03\u6d1b\u5361\u548c\u97e6\u5c3c\u514b\u5931\u8bed\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728MoE\u4e0eTransformer\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff1b\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9776\u5411\u4e9a\u578b\u76f8\u5173\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u80fd\u66f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u590d\u73b0\u5931\u8bed\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e14MoE\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u6027\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u5c40\u90e8\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u529f\u80fd-\u8868\u578b\u6620\u5c04\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5426\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u80fd\u5426\u88ab\u7cfb\u7edf\u64cd\u63a7\u4ee5\u590d\u73b0\u5c40\u7076\u6027\u8111\u635f\u4f24\u6240\u81f4\u7684\u5931\u8bed\u75c7\u8bed\u8a00\u4ea7\u51fa\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u5eb7\u590d\u5047\u8bf4\u68c0\u9a8c\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u529f\u80fd\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53d7\u63a7\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e34\u5e8a grounded \u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7ea7\u5931\u8bed\u6a21\u62df\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\uff08i\uff09\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u5e03\u6d1b\u5361/\u97e6\u5c3c\u514b\u5931\u8bed\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u529f\u80fd\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1b\uff08ii\uff09\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u63a2\u9488\u4efb\u52a1\u89e3\u91ca\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1b\uff08iii\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u9010\u6b65\u6270\u52a8 top-k \u76f8\u5173\u7ec4\u4ef6\u8bf1\u5bfc\u68af\u5ea6\u635f\u4f24\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u897f\u65b9\u5931\u8bed\u75c7\u91cf\u8868\uff08WAB\uff09\u5b50\u6d4b\u9a8c\u53ca\u5931\u8bed\u5546\uff08AQ\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u6548\u679c\uff1b\u5728 MoE \u548c dense Transformer \u4e0a\u7edf\u4e00\u5b9e\u65bd\u3002", "result": "\u9776\u5411\u5931\u8bed\u4e9a\u578b\u76f8\u5173\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u6bd4\u540c\u7b49\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6270\u52a8\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u66f4\u7c7b\u5931\u8bed\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u9000\u5316\uff1bMoE \u67b6\u6784\u56e0\u5176\u6a21\u5757\u6027\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u4e0e\u7ec4\u4ef6-\u8868\u578b\u6620\u5c04\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u4e34\u5e8a\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u662f\u6a21\u62df\u5931\u8bed\u75c7\u8bed\u8a00\u4ea7\u51fa\u969c\u788d\u53ca\u7814\u7a76\u8bed\u8a00\u529f\u80fd\u5728\u9776\u5411\u7834\u574f\u4e0b\u9000\u5316\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6709\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e73\u53f0\u3002"}}

However, poor generalization beyond their training support limits exploration of novel designs and long-time horizon predictions. We introduce NOVA, a route to generalizable neural physics solvers that can provide rapid, accurate solutions to scenarios even under distributional shifts in partial differential equation parameters, geometries and initial conditions. By learning physics-aligned representations from an initial sparse set of scenarios, NOVA consistently achieves 1-2 orders of magnitude lower out-of-distribution errors than data-driven baselines across complex, nonlinear problems including heat transfer, diffusion-reaction and fluid flow. We further showcase NOVA's dual impact on stabilizing long-time dynamical rollouts and improving generative design through application to the simulation of nonlinear Turing systems and fluidic chip optimization. Unlike neural physics solvers that are constrained to retrieval and/or emulation within an a priori space, NOVA enables reliable extrapolation beyond known regimes, a key capability given the need for exploration of novel hypothesis spaces in scientific discovery", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faNOVA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u795e\u7ecf\u7269\u7406\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u7269\u7406\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u957f\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "NOVA\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u7a00\u758f\u521d\u59cb\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7269\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u70ed\u4f20\u5bfc\u3001\u6269\u6563-\u53cd\u5e94\u4e0e\u6d41\u4f53\u6d41\u52a8\u7b49\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\uff0cNOVA\u6bd4\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0a\u4f4e1\u20132\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff1b\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027Turing\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u6d41\u4f53\u82af\u7247\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "NOVA\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u795e\u7ecf\u7269\u7406\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u6216\u5148\u9a8c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4eff\u771f\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u5916\u63a8\uff0c\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u7684\u65b0\u5047\u8bbe\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a2\u7d22\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, achieving accurate segmentation remains a significant challenge due to class imbalance, ambiguous boundaries, and noise interference in ultrasound images, compounded by the scarcity of high-quality annotated data. Current research on PSFH segmentation predominantly relies on CNN and Transformer architectures, leaving the potential of more powerful models underexplored. In this work, we propose a Dual-Student and Teacher framework combining CNN and SAM (DSTCS), which integrates the Segment Anything Model (SAM) into a dual student-teacher architecture. A cooperative learning mechanism between the CNN and SAM branches significantly improves segmentation accuracy. The proposed scheme also incorporates a specialized data augmentation strategy optimized for boundary processing and a novel loss function. Extensive experiments on the MICCAI 2023 and 2024 PSFH segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our method exhibits superior robustness and significantly outperforms existing techniques, providing a reliable segmentation tool for clinical practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408CNN\u4e0eSAM\u7684\u53cc\u5b66\u751f-\u6559\u5e08\u6846\u67b6\uff08DSTCS\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8d85\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u803b\u9aa8\u8054\u5408\u4e0e\u80ce\u513f\u5934\u90e8\uff08PSFH\uff09\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u8fb9\u754c\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u65b0\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5728MICCAI 2023/2024\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "PSFH\u5206\u5272\u5bf9\u4ea7\u7a0b\u76d1\u6d4b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u53d7\u8d85\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u3001\u8fb9\u754c\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u5e72\u6270\u53ca\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u9650\u5236\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56CNN\u6216Transformer\uff0c\u672a\u5145\u5206\u6316\u6398\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982SAM\uff09\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDual-Student and Teacher\u6846\u67b6\uff08DSTCS\uff09\uff0c\u878d\u5408CNN\u4e0eSegment Anything Model\uff08SAM\uff09\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e8c\u8005\u534f\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9762\u5411\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u4e13\u7528\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u65b0\u578b\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728MICCAI 2023\u548c2024 PSFH\u5206\u5272\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\uff0c\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "DSTCS\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8aPSFH\u5206\u5272\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5c06SAM\u878d\u5165\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u6559\u5e08-\u5b66\u751f\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Among existing memory efficient approaches, activation-related optimization has proven particularly effective, as activations consistently dominate overall memory consumption. Although prior arts offer various activation optimization strategies, their data-agnostic nature ultimately results in ineffective and unstable fine tuning. In this paper, we propose TokenSeek, a universal plugin solution for various transformer-based models through instance-aware token seeking and ditching, achieving significant fine-tuning memory savings (e.g., requiring only 14.8% of the memory on Llama3.2 1B) with on-par or even better performance. Furthermore, our interpretable token seeking process reveals the underlying reasons for its effectiveness, offering valuable insights for future research on token efficiency.

While representing problems as graphs is a powerful approach, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are fundamentally constrained by their message-passing mechanism, which imposes a local bottleneck that limits global, holistic reasoning. We argue that dynamic programming (DP), which solves problems by iteratively refining a global state, offers a more powerful and suitable learning paradigm. We introduce FloydNet, a new architecture that embodies this principle. In contrast to local message passing, FloydNet maintains a global, all-pairs relationship tensor and learns a generalized DP operator to progressively refine it. This enables the model to develop a task-specific relational calculus, providing a principled framework for capturing long-range dependencies. Theoretically, we prove that FloydNet achieves 3-WL (2-FWL) expressive power, and its generalized form aligns with the k-FWL hierarchy. FloydNet demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across challenging domains: it achieves near-perfect scores (often >99\\%) on the CLRS-30 algorithmic benchmark, finds exact optimal solutions for the general Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) at rates significantly exceeding strong heuristics, and empirically matches the 3-WL test on the BREC benchmark.

Yet existing evaluations largely remain static or outcome-centric, neglecting the evidence-gathering process. In this work, we propose an interactive evaluation framework that explicitly models the consultation process using a simulated patient and a \\rev{simulated reporter} grounded in atomic evidences. Based on this representation, we introduce Information Coverage Rate (ICR) to quantify how completely an agent uncovers necessary evidence during interaction. To support systematic study, we build EviMed, an evidence-based benchmark spanning diverse conditions from common complaints to rare diseases, and evaluate 10 models with varying reasoning abilities. We find that strong diagnostic reasoning does not guarantee effective information collection, and this insufficiency acts as a primary bottleneck limiting performance in interactive settings. To address this, we propose REFINE, a strategy that leverages diagnostic verification to guide the agent in proactively resolving uncertainties. Extensive experiments demonstrate that REFINE consistently outperforms baselines across diverse datasets and facilitates effective model collaboration, enabling smaller agents to achieve superior performance under strong reasoning supervision.

Correspondingly, graph anomaly detection (GAD) plays a critical role in identifying anomalies across various domains, including finance, cybersecurity, manufacturing, etc. Facing the large-volume and multi-domain graph data, nascent efforts attempt to develop foundational generalist models capable of detecting anomalies in unseen graphs without retraining. To the best of our knowledge, the different feature semantics and dimensions of cross-domain graph data heavily hinder the development of the graph foundation model, leaving further in-depth continual learning and inference capabilities a quite open problem. Hence, we propose OWLEYE, a novel zero-shot GAD framework that learns transferable patterns of normal behavior from multiple graphs, with a threefold contribution. First, OWLEYE proposes a cross-domain feature alignment module to harmonize feature distributions, which preserves domain-specific semantics during alignment. Second, with aligned features, to enable continuous learning capabilities, OWLEYE designs the multi-domain multi-pattern dictionary learning to encode shared structural and attribute-based patterns. Third, for achieving the in-context learning ability, OWLEYE develops a truncated attention-based reconstruction module to robustly detect anomalies without requiring labeled data for unseen graph-structured data. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that OWLEYE achieves superior performance and generalizability compared to state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a strong foundation for scalable and label-efficient anomaly detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faOWLEYE\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u56fe\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u591a\u9886\u57df\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u5b57\u5178\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u622a\u65ad\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u91cd\u5efa\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u672a\u89c1\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "OWLEYE\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6a21\u5757\uff1a1\uff09\u8de8\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u5757\u4ee5\u534f\u8c03\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u9886\u57df\u8bed\u4e49\uff1b2\uff09\u591a\u9886\u57df\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u5b57\u5178\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee5\u7f16\u7801\u5171\u4eab\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u5c5e\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b3\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u622a\u65ad\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cOWLEYE\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "OWLEYE\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u6807\u7b7e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u56fe\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u56fe\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u4e0e\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

However, existing human-scene interaction generation methods typically treat the scene as static, which deviates from reality. Inspired by world models, we introduce Dyn-HSI, the first cognitive architecture for dynamic human-scene interaction, which endows virtual humans with three humanoid components. (1)Vision (human eyes): we equip the virtual human with a Dynamic Scene-Aware Navigation, which continuously perceives changes in the surrounding environment and adaptively predicts the next waypoint. (2)Memory (human brain): we equip the virtual human with a Hierarchical Experience Memory, which stores and updates experiential data accumulated during training. This allows the model to leverage prior knowledge during inference for context-aware motion priming, thereby enhancing both motion quality and generalization.

Yet most current education separates algorithms from systems. Students learn gradient descent without measuring memory usage, and attention mechanisms without profiling computational cost. This split leaves graduates unprepared to debug real production failures and widens the gap between machine learning research and reliable deployment. We present TinyTorch, a 20 module curriculum in which students implement the core components of PyTorch, including tensors, autograd, optimizers, and neural networks, entirely in pure Python. The curriculum is built around three pedagogical principles. Progressive disclosure gradually introduces complexity as students build confidence. Systems first integration embeds memory and performance awareness from the very beginning. Historical milestone validation guides students to recreate key breakthroughs, from the Perceptron in 1958 to modern Transformers, using only code they have written themselves. TinyTorch requires only a laptop with 4GB of RAM and no GPU, making machine learning systems education accessible worldwide. Its goal is to prepare the next generation of AI engineers, practitioners who understand not only what machine learning systems do, but why they work and how to make them scale.

In LLMs, top-p/top-k sampling strategies work exceptionally well: language tokens have high semantic density and low redundancy, so a fixed size of token candidates already strikes a balance between semantic accuracy and generation diversity. In contrast, video tokens have low semantic density and high spatio-temporal redundancy. This mismatch makes static top-k/top-p strategies ineffective for video decoders: they either introduce unnecessary randomness for low-uncertainty regions (static backgrounds) or get stuck in early errors for high-uncertainty regions (foreground objects). Prediction errors will accumulate as more frames are generated and eventually severely degrade long-horizon quality. To address this, we propose Entropy-Guided k-Guard (ENkG) sampling, a simple yet effective strategy that adapts sampling to token-wise dispersion, quantified by the entropy of each token's predicted distribution. ENkG uses adaptive token candidate sizes: for low-entropy regions, it employs fewer candidates to suppress redundant noise and preserve structural integrity; for high-entropy regions, it uses more candidates to mitigate error compounding. ENkG is model-agnostic, training-free, and adds negligible overhead.

For text models, we achieve 21% to 87% higher throughput than llama.cpp across models ranging from Qwen3-0.6B to Nemotron-30B, while providing continuous batching that scales to 4.3x aggregate throughput at 16 concurrent requests. For multimodal models, we introduce content-based prefix caching that eliminates redundant vision encoding by identifying identical images through content hashing, regardless of input format. Our evaluation on Apple M4 Max demonstrates throughput of up to 525 tokens per second on text models and 28x speedup on repeated image queries, reducing multimodal latency from 21.7 seconds to under 1 second.

Code available at", "summary": "We present a fast 3DGS reconstruction pipeline designed to converge within one minute, developed for the SIGGRAPH Asia 3DGS Fast Reconstruction Challenge. The challenge consists of an initial round using SLAM-generated camera poses (with noisy trajectories) and a final round using COLMAP poses (highly accurate). To robustly handle these heterogeneous settings, we develop a two-stage solution. In the first round, we use reverse per-Gaussian parallel optimization and compact forward splatting based on Taming-GS and Speedy-splat, load-balanced tiling, an anchor-based Neural-Gaussian representation enabling rapid convergence with fewer learnable parameters, initialization from monocular depth and partially from feed-forward 3DGS models, and a global pose refinement module for noisy SLAM trajectories. In the final round, the accurate COLMAP poses change the optimization landscape; we disable pose refinement, revert from Neural-Gaussians back to standard 3DGS to eliminate MLP inference overhead, introduce multi-view consistency-guided Gaussian splitting inspired by Fast-GS, and introduce a depth estimator to supervise the rendered depth. Together, these techniques enable high-fidelity reconstruction under a strict one-minute budget.

Yet discovering GPCR modulators remains challenging because receptor activation often arises from complex allosteric effects rather than direct binding affinity, and conventional assays are slow, costly, and not optimized for capturing these dynamics. Here we present GPCR-Filter, a deep learning framework specifically developed for GPCR modulator discovery. We assembled a high-quality dataset of over 90,000 experimentally validated GPCR-ligand pairs, providing a robust foundation for training and evaluation. GPCR-Filter integrates the ESM-3 protein language model for high-fidelity GPCR sequence representations with graph neural networks that encode ligand structures, coupled through an attention-based fusion mechanism that learns receptor-ligand functional relationships. Across multiple evaluation settings, GPCR-Filter consistently outperforms state-of-the-art compound-protein interaction models and exhibits strong generalization to unseen receptors and ligands. Notably, the model successfully identified micromolar-level agonists of the 5-HT\\textsubscript{1A} receptor with distinct chemical frameworks.

However, existing generative models largely rely on weak conditioning signals, such as labels or text, which lack anatomical grounding and often produce biologically implausible outputs. To this end, we introduce Cor2Vox, a cortex-grounded generative framework for brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) synthesis that ties image generation to continuous structural priors of the cerebral cortex. It leverages high-resolution cortical surfaces to guide a 3D shape-to-image Brownian bridge diffusion process, enabling topologically faithful synthesis and precise control over underlying anatomies. To support the generation of new, realistic brain shapes, we developed a large-scale statistical shape model of cortical morphology derived from over 33,000 UK Biobank scans. We validated the fidelity of Cor2Vox based on traditional image quality metrics, advanced cortical surface reconstruction, and whole-brain segmentation quality, outperforming many baseline methods. Across three applications, namely (i) anatomically consistent synthesis, (ii) simulation of progressive gray matter atrophy, and (iii) harmonization of in-house frontotemporal dementia scans with public datasets, Cor2Vox preserved fine-grained cortical morphology at the sub-voxel level, exhibiting remarkable robustness to variations in cortical geometry and disease phenotype without retraining.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCor2Vox\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8111\u76ae\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5408\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u89e3\u5256\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8111MRI\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u5256\u4f9d\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u751f\u7269\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5f31\u6761\u4ef6\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u5982\u6807\u7b7e\u6216\u6587\u672c\uff09\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u3001\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u4e0a\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7f13\u89e3\u771f\u5b9e\u795e\u7ecf\u5f71\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7f55\u89c1\u8868\u578b\u7a00\u7f3a\u3001\u8de8\u8bbe\u5907\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u7eb5\u5411\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u8db3\u7b49\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCor2Vox\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u76ae\u5c42\u8868\u9762\u5f15\u5bfc3D\u5f62\u72b6\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5e03\u6717\u6865\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e33,000+ UK Biobank\u626b\u63cf\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u76ae\u5c42\u5f62\u6001\u7edf\u8ba1\u5f62\u72b6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u65b0\u4e14\u771f\u5b9e\u8111\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u76ae\u5c42\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u5168\u8111\u5206\u5272\u8d28\u91cf\u7b49\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\uff0cCor2Vox\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u5728\u89e3\u5256\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5408\u6210\u3001\u8fdb\u884c\u6027\u7070\u8d28\u840e\u7f29\u6a21\u62df\u53caFTD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u4e09\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e9a\u4f53\u7d20\u7ea7\u76ae\u5c42\u5f62\u6001\u4fdd\u6301\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u76ae\u5c42\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u75be\u75c5\u8868\u578b\u53d8\u5316\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Cor2Vox\u662f\u4e00\u79cd cortex-grounded \u7684\u65b0\u578bMRI\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0e\u8fde\u7eed\u76ae\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u7d27\u5bc6\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u89e3\u5256\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u79cd\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e0e\u7814\u7a76\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

In this work, we first show that a small subset of neurons in LLMs exhibits strong predictive correlations with reasoning correctness. Based on this observation, we propose AdaRAS (Adaptive Reasoning Activation Steering), a lightweight test-time framework that improves reasoning reliability by selectively intervening on neuron activations. AdaRAS identifies Reasoning-Critical Neurons (RCNs) via a polarity-aware mean-difference criterion and adaptively steers their activations during inference, enhancing incorrect reasoning traces while avoiding degradation on already-correct cases. Experiments on 10 mathematics and coding benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements, including over 13% gains on AIME-24 and AIME-25.

Current generative approaches, while capable of synthesizing realistic textures, often suffer from information asymmetry -- the intrinsic disparity between the information-sparse low quality inputs and the information-dense high quality outputs. This imbalance leads to a one-to-many mapping, where insufficient constraints result in stochastic uncertainty and hallucinatory artifacts. To bridge this gap, we present \\textbf{Pref-Restore}, a hierarchical framework that integrates discrete semantic logic with continuous texture generation to achieve deterministic, preference-aligned restoration. Our methodology fundamentally addresses this information disparity through two complementary strategies: (1) Augmenting Input Density: We employ an auto-regressive integrator to reformulate textual instructions into dense latent queries, injecting high-level semantic stability to constrain the degraded signals; (2) Pruning Output Distribution: We pioneer the integration of on-policy reinforcement learning directly into the diffusion restoration loop. By transforming human preferences into differentiable constraints, we explicitly penalize stochastic deviations, thereby sharpening the posterior distribution toward the desired high-fidelity outcomes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Pref-Restore achieves state-of-the-art performance across synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Furthermore, empirical analysis confirms that our preference-aligned strategy significantly reduces solution entropy, establishing a robust pathway toward reliable and deterministic blind restoration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPref-Restore\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u79bb\u6563\u8bed\u4e49\u903b\u8f91\u4e0e\u8fde\u7eed\u7eb9\u7406\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u76f2\u8138\u6062\u590d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u8f93\u5165\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u526a\u679d\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4eba\u8138\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "motivation": "\u76f2\u8138\u6062\u590d\u56e0\u8f93\u5165\u4fe1\u606f\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e0e\u8f93\u51fa\u4fe1\u606f\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5bc6\u96c6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\uff08one-to-many\u6620\u5c04\uff09\u800c\u9762\u4e34\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u5e7b\u89c9\u4f2a\u5f71\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPref-Restore\u6846\u67b6\uff1a(1) \u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6574\u5408\u5668\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u6307\u4ee4\u8f6c\u4e3a\u7a20\u5bc6\u6f5c\u5728\u67e5\u8be2\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u8f93\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b(2) \u5728\u6269\u6563\u6062\u590d\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165on-policy\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u5fae\u7ea6\u675f\u4ee5\u6291\u5236\u968f\u673a\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\u71b5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6062\u590d\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Pref-Restore\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e0e\u504f\u597d\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u76f2\u8138\u6062\u590d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Recent advances in large language models suggest that self-reflection, prompting a model to critique and revise its own outputs, can improve reasoning quality and factual consistency. Building on this idea, this paper introduces Reflective Translation, a prompt-based framework in which a model generates an initial translation, produces a structured self-critique, and then uses this reflection to generate a refined translation. The approach is evaluated on English-isiZulu and English-isiXhosa translation using OPUS-100 and NTREX-African, across multiple prompting strategies and confidence thresholds. Results show consistent improvements in both BLEU and COMET scores between first- and second-pass translations, with average gains of up to +0.22 BLEU and +0.18 COMET. Statistical significance testing using paired nonparametric tests confirms that these improvements are robust. The proposed method is model-agnostic, requires no fine-tuning, and introduces a reflection-augmented dataset that can support future supervised or analysis-driven work. These findings demonstrate that structured self-reflection is a practical and effective mechanism for improving translation quality in low-resource settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u201c\u53cd\u601d\u5f0f\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff08Reflective Translation\uff09\u201d\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u521d\u59cb\u7ffb\u8bd1\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u81ea\u6211\u6279\u8bc4\uff0c\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u4fee\u6b63\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff0c\u5728\u82f1\u8bed-\u7956\u9c81\u8bed\u548c\u82f1\u8bed-\u79d1\u8428\u8bed\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86BLEU\u548cCOMET\u5f97\u5206\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982isiZulu\u548cisiXhosa\uff09\u56e0\u5e73\u884c\u8bed\u6599\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u8d44\u6e90\u532e\u4e4f\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6027\u80fd\u957f\u671f\u53d7\u9650\uff1b\u800c\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u53cd\u601d\u80fd\u529b\u5df2\u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u503c\u5f97\u8fc1\u79fb\u81f3\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faReflective Translation\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u5148\u751f\u6210\u521d\u59cb\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff0c\u518d\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u81ea\u6211\u6279\u8bc4\uff08\u542b\u9519\u8bef\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u4fee\u6b63\u5efa\u8bae\uff09\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u53cd\u601d\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff1b\u5728OPUS-100\u548cNTREX-African\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u591a\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9608\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u82f1\u8bed-isiZulu\u548c\u82f1\u8bed-isiXhosa\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e8c\u904d\u7ffb\u8bd1\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e00\u904d\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347+0.22 BLEU\u548c+0.18 COMET\uff0c\u914d\u5bf9\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u68c0\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u7ed3\u679c\u5177\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u81ea\u53cd\u601d\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u6240\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u53cd\u601d\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ea6\u53ef\u652f\u6491\u540e\u7eed\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6216\u5206\u6790\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Prior studies have demonstrated that linear autoencoders (LAEs) can recover the ordered, axis-aligned principal components of PCA by incorporating non-uniform $\\ell_2$ regularization or by adjusting the loss function. However, these approaches become insufficient in the nonlinear setting, as the remaining variance cannot be properly captured independently of the nonlinear mapping. In this work, we propose a novel autoencoder framework that integrates non-uniform variance regularization with an isometric constraint.

In this work, we present ONCOTIMIA, a modular and secure clinical tool designed to integrate generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) into oncology workflows and evaluate its application to the automatic completion of lung cancer tumour board forms using large language models (LLMs). The system combines a multi-layer data lake, hybrid relational and vector storage, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and a rule-driven adaptive form model to transform unstructured clinical documentation into structured and standardised tumour board records. We assess the performance of six LLMs deployed through AWS Bedrock on ten lung cancer cases, measuring both completion form accuracy and end-to-end latency. The results demonstrate high performance across models, with the best performing configuration achieving an 80% of correct field completion and clinically acceptable response time for most LLMs. Larger and more recent models exhibit best accuracies without incurring prohibitive latency.

A central obstacle is the absence of large-scale, risk-level supervision linking disclosed risks to realized outcomes.\n  We introduce a fully automated data generation pipeline that converts qualitative SEC risk disclosures into temporally grounded supervision using only public data. For each filing, the pipeline generates firm-specific, time-bounded risk queries from the Risk Factors section and labels them by automatically resolving outcomes against subsequent disclosures.\n  Using this dataset of risk queries and outcomes grounded in SEC filings, we train a compact large language model to estimate the probability that a disclosed risk will materialize within a specified horizon. Despite its modest size, the resulting model substantially improves over pretrained and heuristic baselines, and outperforms frontier general-purpose models, including GPT-5, on probabilistic accuracy and calibration.\n  More broadly, this work demonstrates that Foresight Learning enables scalable and fully automated training of domain-specific expert models using only raw, chronological, in-domain text -- without proprietary data, external corpora, or manual annotation. The resulting models achieve frontier-level performance while remaining deployable on a single GPU.

Yet, extracting automatically objective, interpretable features for a detailed analysis of the patient state remains largely unexplored.\n  Among MDD's symptoms, Psychomotor retardation (PMR) is a core item, yet its clinical assessment remains largely subjective. While 3D motion capture offers an objective alternative, its reliance on specialized hardware often precludes routine clinical use. In this paper, we propose a non-invasive computational framework that transforms monocular RGB video into clinically relevant 3D gait kinematics. Our pipeline uses Gravity-View Coordinates along with a novel trajectory-correction algorithm that leverages the closed-loop topology of our adapted Timed Up and Go (TUG) protocol to mitigate monocular depth errors. This novel pipeline enables the extraction of 297 explicit gait biomechanical biomarkers from a single camera capture.\n  To address the challenges of small clinical datasets, we introduce a stability-based machine learning framework that identifies robust motor signatures while preventing overfitting. Validated on the CALYPSO dataset, our method achieves an 83.3% accuracy in detecting PMR and explains 64% of the variance in overall depression severity (R^2=0.64). Notably, our study reveals a strong link between reduced ankle propulsion and restricted pelvic mobility to the depressive motor phenotype.

Current methods, focused on sequence recovery, struggle to address structural objectives like secondary structure consistency (SS), minimum free energy (MFE), and local distance difference test (LDDT), leading to suboptimal structural accuracy. To tackle this, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework integrated with a latent diffusion model (LDM). Drawing inspiration from the success of diffusion models in RNA inverse folding, which adeptly model complex sequence-structure interactions, we develop an LDM incorporating pre-trained RNA-FM embeddings from a large-scale RNA model. These embeddings capture co-evolutionary patterns, markedly improving sequence recovery accuracy. However, existing approaches, including diffusion-based methods, cannot effectively handle non-differentiable structural objectives. By contrast, RL excels in this task by using policy-driven reward optimization to navigate complex, non-gradient-based objectives, offering a significant advantage over traditional methods. In summary, we propose the Step-wise Optimization of Latent Diffusion Model (SOLD), a novel RL framework that optimizes single-step noise without sampling the full diffusion trajectory, achieving efficient refinement of multiple structural objectives. Experimental results demonstrate SOLD surpasses its LDM baseline and state-of-the-art methods across all metrics, establishing a robust framework for RNA inverse folding with profound implications for biotechnological and therapeutic applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08SOLD\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eRNA\u9006\u6298\u53e0\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e8c\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u6700\u5c0f\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\u548cLDDT\u7b49\u975e\u53ef\u5fae\u7ed3\u6784\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RNA\u9006\u6298\u53e0\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u975e\u53ef\u5fae\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u5982SS\u3001MFE\u3001LDDT\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ed3\u6784\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSOLD\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5c06\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8eRNA-FM\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b56\u7565\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u6b65\u566a\u58f0\u5c42\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u7ed3\u6784\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5b8c\u6574\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eSOLD\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u8d85\u8d8a\u5176LDM\u57fa\u7ebf\u53ca\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SOLD\u4e3aRNA\u9006\u6298\u53e0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5bf9\u751f\u7269\u6280\u672f\u4e0e\u6cbb\u7597\u5e94\u7528\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Recent studies formulate SLG within the language modeling framework using autoregressive language models, which suffer from unidirectional context modeling and slow token-by-token inference. To address these limitations, we present MaDiS, a masked-diffusion-based language model for SLG that captures bidirectional dependencies and supports efficient parallel multi-token generation. We further introduce a tri-level cross-modal pretraining scheme that jointly learns from token-, latent-, and 3D physical-space objectives, leading to richer and more grounded sign representations. To accelerate model convergence in the fine-tuning stage, we design a novel unmasking strategy with temporal checkpoints, reducing the combinatorial complexity of unmasking orders by over $10^{41}$ times. In addition, a mixture-of-parts embedding layer is developed to effectively fuse information stored in different part-wise sign tokens through learnable gates and well-optimized codebooks.

Traditional 3D pose estimation approaches often ignore the temporal consistency between frames, causing implausible and jittery motion. The emerging field of kinematics-based 3D motion capture addresses these issues by estimating the temporal transitioning between poses instead. A major drawback in current kinematics approaches is their reliance on Euler angles. Despite their simplicity, Euler angles suffer from discontinuity that leads to unstable motion reconstructions, especially in online settings where trajectory refinement is unavailable. Contrarily, quaternions have no discontinuity and can produce continuous transitions between poses. In this paper, we propose QuaMo, a novel Quaternion Motions method using quaternion differential equations (QDE) for human kinematics capture. We utilize the state-space model, an effective system for describing real-time kinematics estimations, with quaternion state and the QDE describing quaternion velocity. The corresponding angular acceleration is computed from a meta-PD controller with a novel acceleration enhancement that adaptively regulates the control signals as the human quickly changes to a new pose. Unlike previous work, our QDE is solved under the quaternion unit-sphere constraint that results in more accurate estimations. Experimental results show that our novel formulation of the QDE with acceleration enhancement accurately estimates 3D human kinematics with no discontinuity and minimal implausibilities. QuaMo outperforms comparable state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets, namely Human3.6M, Fit3D, SportsPose and AIST.

We propose a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to systematically encode human expertise into interpretable, logic-based rules for detecting anomaly patterns in supply chain time series data. Our approach operates in three stages: 1) LLM-based labeling of training data instructed by domain knowledge, 2) automated generation and iterative improvements of symbolic rules through LLM-driven optimization, and 3) rule augmentation with business-relevant anomaly categories supported by LLMs to enhance interpretability. The experiment results showcase that our approach outperforms the unsupervised learning methods in both detection accuracy and interpretability. Furthermore, compared to direct LLM deployment for time series anomaly detection, our approach provides consistent, deterministic results with low computational latency and cost, making it ideal for production deployment.

We propose a localized latent editing framework that simulates Botulinum Toxin injection effects for injection planning through dose-response modeling. Our key contribution is a Region-Specific Latent Axis Discovery method that learns localized muscle relaxation trajectories in StyleGAN2's latent space, enabling precise control over specific facial regions without global side effects. By correlating these localized latent trajectories with injected toxin units, we learn a predictive dose-response model. We rigorously compare two approaches: direct metric regression versus image-based generative simulation on a clinical dataset of N=360 images from 46 patients. On a hold-out test set, our framework demonstrates moderate-to-strong structural correlations for geometric asymmetry metrics, confirming that the generative model correctly captures the direction of morphological changes.

However, standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) paradigms like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) remain constrained by static uniformity: uniform prompt sampling and a fixed number of rollouts per prompt. For heterogeneous, heavy-tailed reasoning data, this creates structural inefficiencies that waste compute on already-solved patterns while under-training the long tail of hard problems. To address this, we propose Multi-Adversary Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (GDRO), an optimization-first framework that moves beyond uniform reasoning models by dynamically adapting the training distribution.\n  We introduce an Online Difficulty Classifier that partitions prompts into dynamic pass@k difficulty groups. We then propose two independent GDRO games for post-training: (1) Prompt-GDRO, which employs an EMA-debiased multiplicative-weights bandit sampler to target the intensive difficulty margin and upweight persistently hard groups without frequency bias; and (2) Rollout-GDRO, which uses a shadow-price controller to reallocate rollouts across groups, maximizing gradient variance reduction on hard tasks under a fixed mean budget (compute-neutral). We provide no-regret guarantees for both controllers and additionally a variance-proxy analysis motivating a square-root optimal rollout allocation for Rollout-GDRO.

Traditional split learning relies on end-to-end backpropagation across the client-server split point. This incurs a large communication overhead (i.e., forward activations and backward gradients need to be exchanged every iteration) and significant memory use (for storing activations and gradients). In this paper, we develop a beyond-backpropagation training method for split learning. In this approach, the client and server train their model partitions semi-independently, using local loss signals instead of propagated gradients. In particular, the client's network is augmented with a small auxiliary classifier at the split point to provide a local error signal, while the server trains on the client's transmitted activations using the true loss function. This decoupling removes the need to send backward gradients, which cuts communication costs roughly in half and also reduces memory overhead (as each side only stores local activations for its own backward pass). We evaluate our approach on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Our experiments show two key results. First, the proposed approach achieves performance on par with standard split learning that uses backpropagation. Second, it significantly reduces communication (of transmitting activations/gradient) by 50% and peak memory usage by up to 58%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u5206\u5272\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5206\u5272\u70b9\u5f15\u5165\u8f85\u52a9\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u635f\u5931\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4e0e\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u534a\u72ec\u7acb\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5c06\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea650%\uff0c\u5cf0\u503c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u51cf\u5c11\u6700\u591a\u8fbe58%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u5206\u5272\u5b66\u4e60\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u5272\u5b66\u4e60\u4f9d\u8d56\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff08\u6bcf\u8f6e\u9700\u4ea4\u6362\u524d\u5411\u6fc0\u6d3b\u548c\u53cd\u5411\u68af\u5ea6\uff09\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u9ad8\uff08\u9700\u5b58\u50a8\u6fc0\u6d3b\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u5206\u5272\u70b9\u589e\u52a0\u5c0f\u578b\u8f85\u52a9\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u672c\u5730\u8bef\u5dee\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5219\u57fa\u4e8e\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u53cc\u65b9\u4e0d\u518d\u4f20\u9012\u53cd\u5411\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u89e3\u8026\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-10\u548cCIFAR-100\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1a1\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u5206\u5272\u5b66\u4e60\u76f8\u5f53\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u4fe1\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea650%\uff0c\u5cf0\u503c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u964d\u4f4e\u6700\u591a58%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u8d85\u8d8a\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u5206\u5272\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0e\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

While prior methods like CAVP effectively model semantic and temporal correspondences between modalities using contrastive objectives, their performance remains suboptimal. A key limitation is the insufficient modeling of the dense, multi-scale nature of both video and audio signals, correspondences often span fine- to coarse-grained spatial-temporal structures, which are underutilized in existing frameworks. To this end, we propose GMS-CAVP, a novel framework that combines Multi-Scale Video-Audio Alignment and Multi-Scale Spatial-Temporal Diffusion-based pretraining objectives to enhance V-A correspondence modeling. First, GMS-CAVP introduces a multi-scale contrastive learning strategy that captures semantic and temporal relations across varying granularities. Second, we go beyond traditional contrastive learning by incorporating a diffusion-based generative objective, enabling modality translation and synthesis between video and audio. This unified discriminative-generative formulation facilitates deeper cross-modal understanding and paves the way for high-fidelity generation. Extensive experiments on VGGSound, AudioSet, and Panda70M demonstrate that GMS-CAVP outperforms previous methods in generation and retrieval.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faGMS-CAVP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u89c6\u9891-\u97f3\u9891\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u65f6\u7a7a\u6269\u6563\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u9891-\u97f3\u9891\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982CAVP\uff09\u5728\u5efa\u6a21\u89c6\u9891\u4e0e\u97f3\u9891\u4fe1\u53f7\u95f4\u5bc6\u96c6\u3001\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u4ece\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5230\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4-\u65f6\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGMS-CAVP\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u540c\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b2\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u89c6\u9891\u4e0e\u97f3\u9891\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5224\u522b-\u751f\u6210\u7edf\u4e00\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728VGGSound\u3001AudioSet\u548cPanda70M\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGMS-CAVP\u5728\u89c6\u9891-\u97f3\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u80fd\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5730\u6355\u6349\u89c6\u9891-\u97f3\u9891\u95f4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u751f\u6210\u534f\u540c\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Model initialization has emerged as a critical factor in mitigating this degradation, yet the role of modern self-supervised learning under full-model DP remains poorly understood. Here, we present a large-scale evaluation of initialization strategies for differentially private medical image analysis, using chest radiograph classification as a representative benchmark with more than 800,000 images. Using state-of-the-art ConvNeXt models trained with DP-SGD across realistic privacy regimes, we compare non-domain-specific supervised ImageNet initialization, non-domain-specific self-supervised DINOv3 initialization, and domain-specific supervised pretraining on MIMIC-CXR, the largest publicly available chest radiograph dataset. Evaluations are conducted across five external datasets spanning diverse institutions and acquisition settings. We show that DINOv3 initialization consistently improves diagnostic utility relative to ImageNet initialization under DP, but remains inferior to domain-specific supervised pretraining, which achieves performance closest to non-private baselines. We further demonstrate that initialization choice strongly influences demographic fairness, cross-dataset generalization, and robustness to data scale and model capacity under privacy constraints.

We develop a theoretical framework to explain this phenomenon by showing that the empirical score function (the score function corresponding to the empirical distribution) is a weighted sum of the score functions of Gaussian distributions, in which the weights are sharp softmax functions. This structure causes individual training samples to dominate the score function, resulting in sampling collapse. In practice, approximating the empirical score function with a neural network can partially alleviate this issue and improve generalization. Our theoretical framework explains why: In training, the neural network learns a smoother approximation of the weighted sum, allowing the sampling process to be influenced by local manifolds rather than single points. Leveraging this insight, we propose two novel methods to further enhance generalization: (1) Noise Unconditioning enables each training sample to adaptively determine its score function weight to increase the effect of more training samples, thereby preventing single-point dominance and mitigating collapse. (2) Temperature Smoothing introduces an explicit parameter to control the smoothness. By increasing the temperature in the softmax weights, we naturally reduce the dominance of any single training sample and mitigate memorization.

Unlike existing studies that aim to exhaustively annotate all visible objects, GovLA-10K is deliberately designed around functionally salient targets that directly correspond to practical management needs, and further provides actionable management suggestions grounded in these observations. To effectively coordinate the fine-grained visual grounding with high-level contextual language reasoning, GovLA-Reasoner introduces an efficient feature adapter that implicitly coordinates discriminative representation sharing between the visual detector and the large language model (LLM).

In shipyards, pipe spools are critical components; installed deep within hull blocks soon after steel erection, any delay in their procurement can halt all downstream tasks. Recognizing their importance, existing studies predict PLT using the static physical attributes of pipe spools. However, procurement is inherently a dynamic, multi-stakeholder business process involving a continuous sequence of internal and external events at the shipyard, factors often overlooked in traditional approaches. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel framework that combines event logs, dataset records of the procurement events, with static attributes to predict PLT. The temporal attributes of each event are extracted to reflect the continuity and temporal context of the process. Subsequently, a deep sequential neural network combined with a multi-layered perceptron is employed to integrate these static and dynamic features, enabling the model to capture both structural and contextual information in procurement. Comparative experiments are conducted using real-world pipe spool procurement data from a globally renowned South Korean shipbuilding corporation.

This paper presents a simple but effective approach called KeepLoRA to effectively balance these objectives. We first analyze the knowledge retention mechanism within the model parameter space and find that general knowledge is mainly encoded in the principal subspace, while task-specific knowledge is encoded in the residual subspace. Motivated by this finding, KeepLoRA learns new tasks by restricting LoRA parameter updates in the residual subspace to prevent interfering with previously learned capabilities. Specifically, we infuse knowledge for a new task by projecting its gradient onto a subspace orthogonal to both the principal subspace of pre-trained model and the dominant directions of previous task features. Our theoretical and empirical analyses confirm that KeepLoRA balances the three objectives and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Motivated by this, we propose Multi-head Explicit Attention (MEA), a simple yet effective attention variant that explicitly models cross-head interaction. MEA consists of two key components: a Head-level Linear Composition (HLC) module that separately applies learnable linear combinations to the key and value vectors across heads, thereby enabling rich inter-head communication; and a head-level Group Normalization layer that aligns the statistical properties of the recombined heads. MEA shows strong robustness in pretraining, which allows the use of larger learning rates that lead to faster convergence, ultimately resulting in lower validation loss and improved performance across a range of tasks. Furthermore, we explore the parameter efficiency of MEA by reducing the number of attention heads and leveraging HLC to reconstruct them using low-rank \"virtual heads\".

Individual jobs carry heterogeneous contextual features, based on which the agent chooses a job and matches it with a server to maximize the departure rate. The service/departure rate is governed by a logistic model of the contextual feature with an unknown server-specific parameter. To evaluate the performance of a policy, we consider queue length regret, defined as the difference in queue length between the policy and the optimal policy. The main challenge in the analysis is that the lists of remaining job features in the queue may differ under our policy versus the optimal policy for a given time step, since they may process jobs in different orders. To address this, we propose the idea of policy-switching queues equipped with a sophisticated coupling argument. This leads to a novel queue length regret decomposition framework, allowing us to understand the short-term effect of choosing a suboptimal job-server pair and its long-term effect on queue state differences.

The second term evaluates the chromatic dissimilarity between two images in the Oklab perceptual color space. We evaluated the performance of our metric on a non-traditional dataset, called Berkeley-Adobe Perceptual Patch Similarity, which contains a wide range of complex distortions in shapes and colors. We have shown that our metric outperforms the state of the art, especially when images contain shape distortions, confirming also its greater perceptiveness. Furthermore, although deep black-box metrics could be very accurate, they only provide similarity scores between two images, without explaining their main differences and similarities.

While aggregate metrics like validation loss can follow smooth power-law curves, individual downstream tasks exhibit diverse scaling behaviors: some improve monotonically, others plateau, and some even degrade with scale. We argue that predicting downstream performance from validation perplexity suffers from two limitations: averaging token-level losses obscures signal, and no simple parametric family can capture the full spectrum of scaling behaviors. To address this, we propose Neural Neural Scaling Laws (NeuNeu), a neural network that frames scaling law prediction as time-series extrapolation. NeuNeu combines temporal context from observed accuracy trajectories with token-level validation losses, learning to predict future performance without assuming any bottleneck or functional form. Trained entirely on open-source model checkpoints from HuggingFace, NeuNeu achieves 2.04% mean absolute error in predicting model accuracy on 66 downstream tasks -- a 38% reduction compared to logistic scaling laws (3.29% MAE). Furthermore, NeuNeu generalizes zero-shot to unseen model families, parameter counts, and downstream tasks. Our work suggests that predicting downstream scaling laws directly from data outperforms parametric alternatives.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faNeuNeu\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u572866\u4e2a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b02.04%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u8f83\u903b\u8f91\u7f29\u653e\u5f8b\u964d\u4f4e38%\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u5bf9token\u7ea7\u635f\u5931\u53d6\u5e73\u5747\u4f1a\u63a9\u76d6\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4e8c\u662f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u80fd\u8986\u76d6\u5168\u90e8\u7f29\u653e\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u51fd\u6570\u65cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNeuNeu\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u7f29\u653e\u5f8b\u9884\u6d4b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5916\u63a8\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8f68\u8ff9\uff08\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff09\u548ctoken\u7ea7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u8bbe\u74f6\u9888\u6216\u51fd\u6570\u5f62\u5f0f\uff1b\u5b8c\u5168\u57fa\u4e8eHuggingFace\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u572866\u4e2a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a2.04%\uff0c\u6bd4\u903b\u8f91\u7f29\u653e\u5f8b\uff083.29% MAE\uff09\u964d\u4f4e38%\uff1b\u4e14\u80fd\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u81f3\u672a\u89c1\u6a21\u578b\u65cf\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0b\u6e38\u7f29\u653e\u89c4\u5f8b\u4f18\u4e8e\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cNeuNeu\u4e3a\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Building on this framework, we introduce LightSBB-M, an algorithm that computes the optimal SBB transport plan in only a few iterations. The method exploits a dual representation of the SBB objective to obtain analytic expressions for the optimal drift and volatility, and it incorporates a tunable parameter beta greater than zero that interpolates between pure drift (the Schrodinger Bridge) and pure volatility (Bass martingale transport). We show that LightSBB-M achieves the lowest 2-Wasserstein distance on synthetic datasets against state-of-the-art SB and diffusion baselines with up to 32 percent improvement.

As a result, they struggle to represent functions that are continuous yet deliberately non-differentiable (i.e., with prescribed $C^0$ sharp features) without relying on ad hoc post-processing. We present SharpNet, a modified MLP architecture capable of encoding functions with user-defined sharp features by enriching the network with an auxiliary feature function, which is defined as the solution to a Poisson equation with jump Neumann boundary conditions. It is evaluated via an efficient local integral that is fully differentiable with respect to the feature locations, enabling our method to jointly optimize both the feature locations and the MLP parameters to recover the target functions/models. The $C^0$-continuity of SharpNet is precisely controllable, ensuring $C^0$-continuity at the feature locations and smoothness elsewhere. We validate SharpNet on 2D problems and 3D CAD model reconstruction, and compare it against several state-of-the-art baselines. In both types of tasks, SharpNet accurately recovers sharp edges and corners while maintaining smooth behavior away from those features, whereas existing methods tend to smooth out gradient discontinuities.

Widening models yields diminishing returns, and extending context length does not improve fundamental expressivity. In contrast, depth scaling offers theoretically superior expressivity, yet current Transformer architectures struggle to train reliably at extreme depths. We revisit the Post-LayerNorm (Post-LN) formulation, whose instability at scale caused its replacement by Pre-LN in modern LLMs. We show that the central failure mode of Post-LN arises from the ResNet-style residual pathway, which introduces gradient vanishing in deep networks. We present Keel, a Post-LN Transformer that replaces this residual path with a Highway-style connection. This modification preserves the gradient flow through the residual branch, preventing signal vanishing from the top layers to the bottom. Unlike prior methods, Keel enables stable training at extreme depths without requiring specialized initialization or complex optimization tricks. Keel trains robustly at depths exceeding 1000 layers and consistently improves perplexity and depth-scaling characteristics over Pre-LN.

However, many existing approaches rely on end-to-end supervised pipelines or task-specific fine-tuning, resulting in traffic representations that are tightly coupled to labeled datasets and deployment environments, which can limit generalizability. In this paper, we study the problem of learning generalizable traffic representations for IoT device identification. We design compact encoder architectures that learn per-flow embeddings from unlabeled IoT traffic and evaluate them using a frozen-encoder protocol with a simple supervised classifier. Our specific contributions are threefold. (1) We develop unsupervised encoder--decoder models that learn compact traffic representations from unlabeled IoT network flows and assess their quality through reconstruction-based analysis.

We propose Video-KTR, a modality-aware policy shaping framework that performs selective, token-level RL by combining three attribution signals: (1) visual-aware tokens identified via counterfactual masking to reveal perceptual dependence; (2) temporal-aware tokens detected through frame shuffling to expose temporal sensitivity; and (3) high-entropy tokens signaling predictive uncertainty. By reinforcing only these key tokens, Video-KTR focuses learning on semantically informative, modality-sensitive content while filtering out low-value tokens. Across five challenging benchmarks, Video-KTR achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive results, achieving 42.7\\% on Video-Holmes (surpassing GPT-4o) with consistent gains on both reasoning and general video understanding tasks. Ablation studies verify the complementary roles of the attribution signals and the robustness of targeted token-level updates. Overall, Video-KTR improves accuracy and interpretability, offering a simple, drop-in extension to RL for complex video reasoning.

Common approaches based on the straight-through estimator (STE) or soft quantizers often suffer from gradient mismatch, instability, or high computational overhead. As such, we propose StableQAT, a unified and efficient QAT framework that stabilizes training in ultra low-bit settings via a novel, lightweight, and theoretically grounded surrogate for backpropagation derived from a discrete Fourier analysis of the rounding operator. StableQAT strictly generalizes STE as the latter arises as a special case of our more expressive surrogate family, yielding smooth, bounded, and inexpensive gradients that improve QAT training performance and stability across various hyperparameter choices. In experiments, StableQAT exhibits stable and efficient QAT at 2-4 bit regimes, demonstrating improved training stability, robustness, and superior performance with negligible training overhead against standard QAT techniques.

However, classical algorithms for $k$-clustering (such as $k$-median and $k$-means) assume access to exact pairwise distances -- an unrealistic requirement in many modern applications. We study clustering in the \\emph{Rank-model (R-model)}, where access to distances is entirely replaced by a \\emph{quadruplet oracle} that provides only relative distance comparisons. In practice, such an oracle can represent learned models or human feedback, and is expected to be noisy and entail an access cost.\n  Given a metric space with $n$ input items, we design randomized algorithms that, using only a noisy quadruplet oracle, compute a set of $O(k \\cdot \\mathsf{polylog}(n))$ centers along with a mapping from the input items to the centers such that the clustering cost of the mapping is at most constant times the optimum $k$-clustering cost. Our method achieves a query complexity of $O(n\\cdot k \\cdot \\mathsf{polylog}(n))$ for arbitrary metric spaces and improves to $O((n+k^2) \\cdot \\mathsf{polylog}(n))$ when the underlying metric has bounded doubling dimension. When the metric has bounded doubling dimension we can further improve the approximation from constant to $1+\\varepsilon$, for any arbitrarily small constant $\\varepsilon\\in(0,1)$, while preserving the same asymptotic query complexity.

However, deployment often demands architectures of varying sizes, exposing limitations of conventional pre-training and fine-tuning. To address this, we propose SWEET, a self-supervised framework that performs constraint-based pre-training to enable scalable initialization in vision tasks. Instead of pre-training a fixed-size model, we learn a shared weight template and size-specific weight scalers under Tucker-based factorization, which promotes modularity and supports flexible adaptation to architectures with varying depths and widths. Target models are subsequently initialized by composing and reweighting the template through lightweight weight scalers, whose parameters can be efficiently learned from minimal training data. To further enhance flexibility in width expansion, we introduce width-wise stochastic scaling, which regularizes the template along width-related dimensions and encourages robust, width-invariant representations for improved cross-width generalization.

From a cognitive science perspective, humans segment continuous sensory streams into discrete events and rely on these key events for decision-making. Motivated by this principle, we propose the Event-Aware World Model (EAWM), a general framework that learns event-aware representations to streamline policy learning without requiring handcrafted labels. EAWM employs an automated event generator to derive events from raw observations and introduces a Generic Event Segmentor (GES) to identify event boundaries, which mark the start and end time of event segments. Through event prediction, the representation space is shaped to capture meaningful spatio-temporal transitions.

However, existing VGG- and CLIP-based methods struggle to model multi-view consistency within the model itself, while diffusion-based approaches can capture such consistency but rely on denoising directions, leading to unstable training. To address these limitations, we propose DiffStyle3D, a novel diffusion-based paradigm for 3DGS style transfer that directly optimizes in the latent space. Specifically, we introduce an Attention-Aware Loss that performs style transfer by aligning style features in the self-attention space, while preserving original content through content feature alignment. Inspired by the geometric invariance of 3D stylization, we propose a Geometry-Guided Multi-View Consistency method that integrates geometric information into self-attention to enable cross-view correspondence modeling. Based on geometric information, we additionally construct a geometry-aware mask to prevent redundant optimization in overlapping regions across views, which further improves multi-view consistency.

Prior research has established that the difference between an input sample and its reconstructed version produced by an auxiliary model can serve as a useful proxy for uncertainty. However, directly comparing reconstructions with the original input is degraded by information loss and sensitivity to superficial details, which limits its effectiveness. In this work, we propose Difference Reconstruction Uncertainty Estimation (DRUE), a method that mitigates this limitation by reconstructing inputs from two intermediate layers and measuring the discrepancy between their outputs as the uncertainty score. To evaluate uncertainty estimation in practice, we follow the widely used out-of-distribution (OOD) detection paradigm, where in-distribution (ID) training data are compared against datasets with increasing domain shift. Using glaucoma detection as the ID task, we demonstrate that DRUE consistently achieves superior AUC and AUPR across multiple OOD datasets, highlighting its robustness and reliability under distribution shift.

Existing Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based methods struggle with slow rendering speeds and suboptimal color restoration, while 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) inherently lacks the capability to model complex volumetric scattering effects. To address these issues, we introduce WaterClear-GS, the first pure 3DGS-based framework that explicitly integrates underwater optical properties of local attenuation and scattering into Gaussian primitives, eliminating the need for an auxiliary medium network. Our method employs a dual-branch optimization strategy to ensure underwater photometric consistency while naturally recovering water-free appearances. This strategy is enhanced by depth-guided geometry regularization and perception-driven image loss, together with exposure constraints, spatially-adaptive regularization, and physically guided spectral regularization, which collectively enforce local 3D coherence and maintain natural visual perception. Experiments on standard benchmarks and our newly collected dataset demonstrate that WaterClear-GS achieves outstanding performance on both novel view synthesis (NVS) and underwater image restoration (UIR) tasks, while maintaining real-time rendering.

These methods can be broadly categorized into the data-level and the algorithm-level. The former aims to synthesize minority-class nodes to mitigate quantity imbalance, while the latter tries to optimize the learning process to highlight minority classes. However, neither of them addresses the inherently imbalanced graph structure, which is a fundamental factor that incurs majority-class dominance and minority-class assimilation in GNNs. Our theoretical analysis further supports this critical insight. Therefore, we propose GraphSB (Graph Structural Balance), a novel framework that incorporates Structural Balance as a key strategy to address the underlying imbalanced graph structure before node synthesis. Structural Balance performs a two-stage structure optimization: Structure Enhancement that mines hard samples near decision boundaries through dual-view analysis and enhances connectivity for minority classes through adaptive augmentation, and Relation Diffusion that propagates the enhanced minority context while simultaneously capturing higher-order structural dependencies. Thus, GraphSB balances structural distribution before node synthesis, enabling more effective learning in GNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphSB significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, the proposed Structural Balance can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art methods as a simple plug-and-play module, increasing their accuracy by an average of 4.57%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faGraphSB\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5e73\u8861\uff08Structural Balance\uff09\u89e3\u51b3\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u8282\u70b9\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u7ed3\u6784\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u6269\u6563\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u591a\u6570\u7c7b\u4e3b\u5bfc\u548c\u5c11\u6570\u7c7b\u540c\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGraphSB\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u7ed3\u6784\u589e\u5f3a\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u89c6\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u6316\u6398\u96be\u6837\u672c\u5e76\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u589e\u5f3a\u5c11\u6570\u7c7b\u8fde\u63a5\u6027\uff09\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u6269\u6563\uff08\u4f20\u64ad\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5c11\u6570\u7c7b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5e76\u6355\u83b7\u9ad8\u9636\u7ed3\u6784\u4f9d\u8d56\uff09\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "GraphSB\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u5176\u7ed3\u6784\u5e73\u8861\u6a21\u5757\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u73874.57%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u662f\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u5e73\u8861\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u8282\u70b9\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Activation steering techniques offer a promising inference-time intervention approach, but existing methods suffer from critical limitations: activation addition requires careful coefficient tuning and is sensitive to layer-specific norm variations, while directional ablation provides only binary control. Recent work on Angular Steering introduces continuous control via rotation in a 2D subspace, but its practical implementation violates norm preservation, causing distribution shift and generation collapse, particularly in models below 7B parameters. We propose Selective Steering, which addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) a mathematically rigorous norm-preserving rotation formulation that maintains activation distribution integrity, and (2) discriminative layer selection that applies steering only where feature representations exhibit opposite-signed class alignment. Experiments across nine models demonstrate that Selective Steering achieves 5.5x higher attack success rates than prior methods while maintaining zero perplexity violations and approximately 100\\% capability retention on standard benchmarks. Our approach provides a principled, efficient framework for controllable and stable LLM behavior modification.

Growing demand for rapid iteration, high-fidelity detail, and accessible content creation has further increased interest in this area. Existing methods broadly follow two paradigms - indirect 2D-to-3D reconstruction and direct 3D generation - but both are limited by weak structural modeling and heavy reliance on large-scale ground-truth supervision, often producing structural artifacts, geometric inconsistencies, and degraded high-frequency details in complex scenes. We propose GeoDiff3D, an efficient self-supervised framework that uses coarse geometry as a structural anchor and a geometry-constrained 2D diffusion model to provide texture-rich reference images. Importantly, GeoDiff3D does not require strict multi-view consistency of the diffusion-generated references and remains robust to the resulting noisy, inconsistent guidance.

Existing approaches primarily concentrate on learning domain-invariant features, which assume that a model robust to variations in the source domains will generalize well to unseen target domains. However, these approaches neglect a deeper analysis at the parameter level, which makes the model hard to explicitly differentiate between parameters sensitive to domain shifts and those robust, potentially hindering its overall ability to generalize. In order to address these limitations, we first build a covariance-based parameter sensitivity analysis framework to quantify the sensitivity of each parameter in a model to domain shifts. By computing the covariance of parameter gradients across multiple source domains, we can identify parameters that are more susceptible to domain variations, which serves as our theoretical foundation. Based on this, we propose Domain-Sensitive Parameter Regularization (DSP-Reg), a principled framework that guides model optimization by a soft regularization technique that encourages the model to rely more on domain-invariant parameters while suppressing those that are domain-specific. This approach provides a more granular control over the model's learning process, leading to improved robustness and generalization to unseen domains.

Given an input ear image and an automatically derived accessory mask, the inpainting model reconstructs clean and anatomically plausible ear regions by synthesizing missing pixels while preserving local geometric coherence along key ear structures, including the helix, antihelix, concha, and lobule.

We present SEAFormer, a novel transformer that incorporates both node-level and edge-level information in decision-making through two key innovations. First, our Clustered Proximity Attention (CPA) exploits locality-aware clustering to reduce the complexity of attention from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ while preserving global perspective, allowing SEAFormer to efficiently train on large instances.

To mitigate this, we introduce Youtu-VL, a framework leveraging the Vision-Language Unified Autoregressive Supervision (VLUAS) paradigm, which fundamentally shifts the optimization objective from ``vision-as-input'' to ``vision-as-target.'' By integrating visual tokens directly into the prediction stream, Youtu-VL applies unified autoregressive supervision to both visual details and linguistic content. Furthermore, we extend this paradigm to encompass vision-centric tasks, enabling a standard VLM to perform vision-centric tasks without task-specific additions.

Furthermore, progress in this direction is hindered by the limited availability of open, high-quality datasets tailored to the analog domain, restricting both the benchmarking and the generalizability of ML-based techniques.

Inspired by recent advances in Video QA, many existing AVQA approaches primarily focus on visual information processing, leveraging pre-trained models to extract object-level and motion-level representations. However, in those methods, the audio input is primarily treated as complementary to video analysis, and the textual question information contributes minimally to audio--visual understanding, as it is typically integrated only in the final stages of reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Query-guided Spatial--Temporal--Frequency (QSTar) interaction method, which effectively incorporates question-guided clues and exploits the distinctive frequency-domain characteristics of audio signals, alongside spatial and temporal perception, to enhance audio--visual understanding. Furthermore, we introduce a Query Context Reasoning (QCR) block inspired by prompting, which guides the model to focus more precisely on semantically relevant audio and visual features.

We propose a paradigm shift from Internal Diagnosis to External Semantic Auditing, arguing that effective defense requires decoupling safety from the victim model via an independent, semantically grounded auditor. To this end, we present a framework harnessing Universal Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as evolving semantic gatekeepers. We introduce PRISM (Prototype Refinement & Inspection via Statistical Monitoring), which overcomes the domain gap of general VLMs through two key mechanisms: a Hybrid VLM Teacher that dynamically refines visual prototypes online, and an Adaptive Router powered by statistical margin monitoring to calibrate gating thresholds in real-time. Extensive evaluation across 17 datasets and 11 attack types demonstrates that PRISM achieves state-of-the-art performance, suppressing Attack Success Rate to <1% on CIFAR-10 while improving clean accuracy, establishing a new standard for model-agnostic, externalized security.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPRISM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5916\u90e8\u8bed\u4e49\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408VLM\u6559\u5e08\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8def\u7531\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u9632\u5fa1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u5e72\u51c0\u6837\u672c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5185\u90e8\u8bca\u65ad\uff08\u5982\u6a21\u578b\u4fee\u590d\u6216\u8f93\u5165\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u6613\u53d7\u9ad8\u7ea7\u653b\u51fb\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u4ecd\u4e0e\u88ab\u6c61\u67d3\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u8026\u5408\uff1b\u9700\u5c06\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4ece\u53d7\u5bb3\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u8f6c\u5411\u5916\u90e8\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u5ba1\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5916\u90e8\u8bed\u4e49\u5ba1\u8ba1\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u6784\u5efaPRISM\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u6df7\u5408VLM\u6559\u5e08\u5728\u7ebf\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u539f\u578b\u4ee5\u5f25\u5408\u9886\u57df\u5dee\u8ddd\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u7edf\u8ba1\u95f4\u9694\u76d1\u63a7\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8def\u7531\u5668\u5b9e\u65f6\u6821\u51c6\u95e8\u63a7\u9608\u503c\uff1b\u6574\u4f53\u4ee5\u901a\u7528VLM\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u8bed\u4e49\u5b88\u95e8\u4eba\u3002", "result": "\u572817\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c11\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cPRISM\u5c06CIFAR-10\u4e0a\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u538b\u5236\u81f3<1%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u5e72\u51c0\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "PRISM\u786e\u7acb\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u5916\u90e8\u5316\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u65b0\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5916\u90e8\u8bed\u4e49\u5ba1\u8ba1\u8303\u5f0f\u5728\u540e\u95e8\u9632\u5fa1\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Hyperbolic geometry provides a natural framework for representing such structures. Building on this property, this work introduces HexFormer, a hyperbolic vision transformer for image classification that incorporates exponential map aggregation within its attention mechanism. Two designs are explored: a hyperbolic ViT (HexFormer) and a hybrid variant (HexFormer-Hybrid) that combines a hyperbolic encoder with an Euclidean linear classification head. HexFormer incorporates a novel attention mechanism based on exponential map aggregation, which yields more accurate and stable aggregated representations than standard centroid based averaging, showing that simpler approaches retain competitive merit. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate consistent performance improvements over Euclidean baselines and prior hyperbolic ViTs, with the hybrid variant achieving the strongest overall results. Additionally, this study provides an analysis of gradient stability in hyperbolic transformers. The results reveal that hyperbolic models exhibit more stable gradients and reduced sensitivity to warmup strategies compared to Euclidean architectures, highlighting their robustness and efficiency in training. Overall, these findings indicate that hyperbolic geometry can enhance vision transformer architectures by improving gradient stability and accuracy. In addition, relatively simple mechanisms such as exponential map aggregation can provide strong practical benefits.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faHexFormer\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cc\u66f2\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6307\u6570\u6620\u5c04\u805a\u5408\u6539\u8fdb\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u68af\u5ea6\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u6587\u672c\u3001\u56fe\uff09\u5e38\u5177\u6709\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u6b27\u6c0f\u51e0\u4f55\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\uff1b\u800c\u53cc\u66f2\u51e0\u4f55\u5929\u7136\u9002\u5408\u8868\u793a\u6b64\u7c7b\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHexFormer\uff08\u7eaf\u53cc\u66f2ViT\uff09\u548cHexFormer-Hybrid\uff08\u53cc\u66f2\u7f16\u7801\u5668+\u6b27\u6c0f\u5206\u7c7b\u5934\uff09\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u6570\u6620\u5c04\u805a\u5408\u7684\u65b0\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u8d28\u5fc3\u5e73\u5747\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176\u68af\u5ea6\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u4e8e\u6b27\u6c0f\u57fa\u7ebf\u53ca\u4ee5\u5f80\u53cc\u66f2ViT\uff1bHybrid\u53d8\u4f53\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\uff1b\u53cc\u66f2\u6a21\u578b\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u5bf9warmup\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cc\u66f2\u51e0\u4f55\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3aViT\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u7b80\u5355\u673a\u5236\uff08\u5982\u6307\u6570\u6620\u5c04\u805a\u5408\uff09\u5df2\u5177\u663e\u8457\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

EgoHandICL introduces complementary exemplar retrieval guided by vision-language models (VLMs), an ICL-tailored tokenizer for multimodal context, and a masked autoencoder (MAE)-based architecture trained with hand-guided geometric and perceptual objectives. Experiments on ARCTIC and EgoExo4D show consistent gains over state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate real-world generalization and improve EgoVLM hand-object interaction reasoning by using reconstructed hands as visual prompts.

In practice, demonstrations are frequently sparse, suboptimal, or misaligned, which can degrade performance when these demonstrations are integrated into RL. We propose Adaptive Policy Composition (APC), a hierarchical model that adaptively composes multiple data-driven Normalizing Flow (NF) priors. Instead of enforcing strict adherence to the priors, APC estimates each prior's applicability to the target task while leveraging them for exploration. Moreover, APC either refines useful priors, or sidesteps misaligned ones when necessary to optimize downstream reward. Across diverse benchmarks, APC accelerates learning when demonstrations are aligned, remains robust under severe misalignment, and leverages suboptimal demonstrations to bootstrap exploration while avoiding performance degradation caused by overly strict adherence to suboptimal demonstrations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u7ec4\u5408\uff08APC\uff09\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\uff08NF\uff09\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u5730\u5229\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u6b21\u4f18\u6216\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6f14\u793a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u52a0\u901f\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u907f\u514d\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f14\u793a\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u6f14\u793a\u662f\u6700\u4f18\u4e14\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u6f14\u793a\u5f80\u5f80\u662f\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u6b21\u4f18\u6216\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u7ec4\u5408\uff08APC\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\uff08NF\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u5404\u5148\u9a8c\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u7cbe\u70bc\u6709\u7528\u5148\u9a8c\u6216\u7ed5\u8fc7\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cAPC\u5728\u6f14\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u6b21\u4f18\u6f14\u793a\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u56e0\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6b21\u4f18\u6f14\u793a\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "APC\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6f14\u793a\u5229\u7528\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u975e\u7406\u60f3\u6f14\u793a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Accepted at ICLR 2026", "summary": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) rely on fixed-size kernels scanning local patches, which limits their ability to capture global context or long-range dependencies without very deep architectures. Vision Transformers (ViTs), in turn, provide global connectivity but lack spatial inductive bias, depend on explicit positional encodings, and remain tied to the initial patch size. Bridging these limitations requires a representation that is both structured and global. We introduce SONIC (Spectral Oriented Neural Invariant Convolutions), a continuous spectral parameterisation that models convolutional operators using a small set of shared, orientation-selective components. These components define smooth responses across the full frequency domain, yielding global receptive fields and filters that adapt naturally across resolutions. Across synthetic benchmarks, large-scale image classification, and 3D medical datasets, SONIC shows improved robustness to geometric transformations, noise, and resolution shifts, and matches or exceeds convolutional, attention-based, and prior spectral architectures with an order of magnitude fewer parameters. These results demonstrate that continuous, orientation-aware spectral parameterisations provide a principled and scalable alternative to conventional spatial and spectral operators.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSONIC\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5efa\u6a21\u5377\u79ef\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8868\u793a\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u5c40\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u548c\u8de8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u6362\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u66f4\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "CNNs\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u5c3a\u5bf8\u5377\u79ef\u6838\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff1bViTs\u867d\u5177\u5168\u5c40\u8fde\u63a5\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\uff1b\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u517c\u5177\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u8868\u5f81\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSONIC\uff08Spectral Oriented Neural Invariant Convolutions\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u5171\u4eab\u3001\u65b9\u5411\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5b9a\u4e49\u8986\u76d6\u5168\u9891\u57df\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u5168\u5c40\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u548c\u5929\u7136\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5377\u79ef\u7b97\u5b50\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u3001\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u53ca3D\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cSONIC\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u6362\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u53d8\u5316\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edfCNN\u3001ViT\u53ca\u5148\u524d\u8c31\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fde\u7eed\u3001\u65b9\u5411\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8c31\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u539f\u7406\u6e05\u6670\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f20\u7edf\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u8c31\u57df\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u6709\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u3002"}}

While machine learning has been applied to injury prediction before, existing approaches often rely on static pre-season data and binary outcomes, limiting their real-world utility. This study investigates the feasibility of using a DeepHit neural network to forecast time-to-injury from longitudinal athlete monitoring data, while providing interpretable predictions. The analysis utilised the publicly available SoccerMon dataset, containing two seasons of training, match, and wellness records from elite female footballers. Data was pre-processed through cleaning, feature engineering, and the application of three imputation strategies. Baseline models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression) were optimised via grid search for benchmarking, while the DeepHit model, implemented with a multilayer perceptron backbone, was evaluated using chronological and leave-one-player-out (LOPO) validation.

Existing vector steering methods adjust the magnitude of answer vectors, but this creates a fundamental trade-off -- reducing jailbreak increases over-refusal and vice versa. We identify the root cause: LLMs encode the decision to answer (answer vector $v_a$) and the judgment of input safety (benign vector $v_b$) as nearly orthogonal directions, treating them as independent processes. We propose LLM-VA, which aligns $v_a$ with $v_b$ through closed-form weight updates, making the model's willingness to answer causally dependent on its safety assessment -- without fine-tuning or architectural changes. Our method identifies vectors at each layer using SVMs, selects safety-relevant layers, and iteratively aligns vectors via minimum-norm weight modifications. Experiments on 12 LLMs demonstrate that LLM-VA achieves 11.45% higher F1 than the best baseline while preserving 95.92% utility, and automatically adapts to each model's safety bias without manual tuning.

Although multimodal models have advanced across languages, their ability to process Arabic script, especially in artistic and stylized calligraphic forms, remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we present DuwatBench, a benchmark of 1,272 curated samples containing about 1,475 unique words across six classical and modern calligraphic styles, each paired with sentence-level detection annotations. The dataset reflects real-world challenges in Arabic writing, such as complex stroke patterns, dense ligatures, and stylistic variations that often challenge standard text recognition systems. Using DuwatBench, we evaluated 13 leading Arabic and multilingual multimodal models and showed that while they perform well on clean text, they struggle with calligraphic variation, artistic distortions, and precise visual-text alignment. By publicly releasing DuwatBench and its annotations, we aim to advance culturally grounded multimodal research, foster fair inclusion of the Arabic language and visual heritage in AI systems, and support continued progress in this area.

Many mainstream approaches face challenges when dealing with decoupled data. Besides, they also suffer from low efficiency and fidelity in strongly coupled spatio-temporal physical systems. Here we propose GenCP, a novel and elegant generative paradigm for coupled multiphysics simulation. By formulating coupled-physics modeling as a probability modeling problem, our key innovation is to integrate probability density evolution in generative modeling with iterative multiphysics coupling, thereby enabling training on data from decoupled simulation and inferring coupled physics during sampling.

Under this geometry, intermediate states correspond to different resolutions of a shared representation, and we provide a geometric analysis establishing contraction and stable convergence across iterations. As a consequence of this scale-consistent structure, halting naturally admits a ranking-based formulation driven by intrinsic feature quality rather than extrinsic objectives.

Widely adopted knowledge distillation methods often devolve into coarse-grained mimicry, where the student model inefficiently targets its own weaknesses and risks inheriting the teacher's reasoning flaws. This exposes a critical pedagogical dilemma: how to devise a reliable curriculum when the teacher itself is not an infallible expert. Our work resolves this by capitalizing on a key insight: while LLMs may exhibit fallibility in complex, holistic reasoning, they often exhibit high fidelity on focused, atomic sub-problems. Based on this, we propose Divergence-Guided Reasoning Curriculum (DGRC), which constructs a learning path from atomic knowledge to reasoning chains by dynamically deriving two complementary curricula from disagreements in reasoning pathways. When a student and teacher produce conflicting results, DGRC directs the teacher to perform a diagnostic analysis: it analyzes both reasoning paths to formulate atomic queries that target the specific points of divergence, and then self-answers these queries to create high-confidence atomic question-answer pairs. These pairs then serve a dual purpose: (1) providing an atomic curriculum to rectify the student's knowledge gaps, and (2) serving as factual criteria to filter the teacher's original reasoning chains, yielding a verified CoT curriculum that teaches the student how to integrate atomic knowledge into complete reasoning paths. Experiments across the medical and legal domains on student models of various sizes demonstrate the effectiveness of our DGRC framework.

We prove the equivalence of two measures of intersectional fairness (MSD and SPSF) in detecting the most unfair subgroup and empirically demonstrate that our MIO-based algorithm improves performance in finding bias. We train high-performing, interpretable classifiers that bound intersectional bias below an acceptable threshold, offering a robust solution for regulated industries and beyond.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u4f18\u5316\uff08MIO\uff09\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u517c\u5177\u4ea4\u53c9\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0e\u5185\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u5bf9AI\u6a21\u578b\u516c\u5e73\u900f\u660e\u7684\u76d1\u7ba1\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u91d1\u878d\u3001\u533b\u7597\uff09\u5bf9AI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u900f\u660e\u6027\u6709\u4e25\u683c\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u884c\u6cd5\u89c4\uff08\u5982\u6b27\u76dfAI\u6cd5\u6848\uff09\u5bf9\u2018\u504f\u89c1\u2019\u5b9a\u4e49\u6a21\u7cca\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u5728\u53d7\u4fdd\u62a4\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u89e3\u51b3\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u4f18\u5316\uff08MIO\uff09\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e2\u6ee1\u8db3\u4ea4\u53c9\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff08\u901a\u8fc7MSD\u4e0eSPSF\u4e24\u79cd\u5ea6\u91cf\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u4fdd\u969c\uff09\u53c8\u5177\u5907\u5185\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86MSD\u4e0eSPSF\u4e24\u79cd\u4ea4\u53c9\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u6700\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u5b50\u7fa4\u4e0a\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6240\u63d0MIO\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u4ea4\u53c9\u504f\u89c1\u65b9\u9762\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u4f18\uff1b\u6210\u529f\u8bad\u7ec3\u51fa\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u4ea4\u53c9\u504f\u89c1\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u53d7\u76d1\u7ba1\u884c\u4e1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u517c\u987e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u7684\u9c81\u68d2AI\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u63a8\u5e7f\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We present a measure-theoretic framework that models learning as the evolution of representation measures on a fixed embedding manifold. By establishing value and gradient consistency in the large-batch limit, we bridge the stochastic objective to explicit deterministic energy landscapes, uncovering a fundamental geometric bifurcation between the unimodal and multimodal regimes. In the unimodal setting, the intrinsic landscape is strictly convex with a unique Gibbs equilibrium; here, entropy acts merely as a tie-breaker, clarifying \"uniformity\" as a constrained expansion within the alignment basin. In contrast, the symmetric multimodal objective contains a persistent negative symmetric divergence term that remains even after kernel sharpening. We show that this term induces barrier-driven co-adaptation, enforcing a population-level modality gap as a structural geometric necessity rather than an initialization artifact. Our results shift the analytical lens from pointwise discrimination to population geometry, offering a principled basis for diagnosing and controlling distributional misalignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6d4b\u5ea6\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5206\u6790InfoNCE\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u5dee\u5f02\uff1a\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u4e0b\u666f\u89c2\u4e25\u683c\u51f8\uff0c\u5747\u5300\u6027\u4ec5\u4e3a\u5bf9\u9f50\u76c6\u5730\u5185\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u6269\u5c55\uff1b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u6709\u8d1f\u5bf9\u79f0\u6563\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u9699\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9InfoNCE\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5bf9\u9f50-\u5747\u5300\u6027\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u5176\u6df1\u5c42\u51e0\u4f55\u673a\u5236\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\uff09\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u523b\u753b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u8868\u793a\u6d4b\u5ea6\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u6d4b\u5ea6\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u6279\u6b21\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u7684\u503c\u4e0e\u68af\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5c06\u968f\u673a\u76ee\u6807\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\u91cf\u666f\u89c2\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u4e0e\u5bf9\u79f0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u76ee\u6807\u4e0b\u7684\u666f\u89c2\u51e0\u4f55\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u4e0b\u5185\u5728\u666f\u89c2\u4e25\u683c\u51f8\u3001\u5177\u552f\u4e00Gibbs\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u71b5\u4ec5\u8d77\u5e73\u5c40\u4f5c\u7528\uff1b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u65e0\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6838\u9510\u5316\u6d88\u9664\u7684\u8d1f\u5bf9\u79f0\u6563\u5ea6\u9879\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u52bf\u5792\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u534f\u540c\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u5236\u4ea7\u751f\u7fa4\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u9699\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u5e94\u4ece\u70b9\u7ea7\u5224\u522b\u8f6c\u5411\u7fa4\u4f53\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u8c03\u63a7\u5206\u5e03\u9519\u4f4d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u7406\u6027\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We prove that entropy scheduling under non-stationarity can be reduced to a one-dimensional, round-by-round trade-off, faster tracking of the optimal solution after drift vs. avoiding gratuitous randomness when the environment is stable, so exploration strength can be driven by measurable online drift signals. Building on this, we propose AES (Adaptive Entropy Scheduling), which adaptively adjusts the entropy coefficient/temperature online using observable drift proxies during training, requiring almost no structural changes and incurring minimal overhead. Across 4 algorithm variants, 12 tasks, and 4 drift modes, AES significantly reduces the fraction of performance degradation caused by drift and accelerates recovery after abrupt changes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAES\uff08\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u71b5\u8c03\u5ea6\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u89c2\u6d4b\u73af\u5883\u6f02\u79fb\u4fe1\u53f7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u71b5\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u73af\u5883\u7a33\u5b9a\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u8fc7\u5ea6\u63a2\u7d22\u3001\u5728\u53d1\u751f\u6f02\u79fb\u65f6\u52a0\u5feb\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5e38\u9762\u4e34\u73af\u5883\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u91c7\u7528\u9759\u6001\u71b5\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u671f\u8fc7\u63a2\u7d22\u3001\u6f02\u79fb\u540e\u6b20\u63a2\u7d22\u4e14\u6062\u590d\u6162\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4f9d\u636e\u6f02\u79fb\u7a0b\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u63a2\u7d22\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u71b5\u8c03\u5ea6\u53ef\u5f52\u7ea6\u4e3a\u5355\u7ef4\u8f6e\u6b21\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5feb\u901f\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6700\u4f18\u89e3 vs \u907f\u514d\u5197\u4f59\u968f\u673a\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u6f02\u79fb\u4ee3\u7406\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u71b5\u7cfb\u6570/\u6e29\u5ea6\u8c03\u6574\u673a\u5236\uff08AES\uff09\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5927\u5e45\u4fee\u6539\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u57284\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u53d8\u4f53\u300112\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u548c4\u7c7b\u6f02\u79fb\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\uff0cAES\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6f02\u79fb\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u52a0\u901f\u4e86\u7a81\u53d8\u540e\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u3002", "conclusion": "AES\u4e3a\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u539f\u7406\u6e05\u6670\u3001\u5b9e\u73b0\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u5f00\u9500\u6781\u4f4e\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a2\u7d22\u8c03\u63a7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u63a2\u7d22\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6f02\u79fb\u5e45\u5ea6\u5339\u914d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

We present ProToken, a novel Provenance methodology for Token-level attribution in federated LLMs that addresses client attribution during autoregressive text generation while maintaining FL privacy constraints. ProToken leverages two key insights to enable provenance at each token: (1) transformer architectures concentrate task-specific signals in later blocks, enabling strategic layer selection for computational tractability, and (2) gradient-based relevance weighting filters out irrelevant neural activations, focusing attribution on neurons that directly influence token generation. We evaluate ProToken across 16 configurations spanning four LLM architectures (Gemma, Llama, Qwen, SmolLM) and four domains (medical, financial, mathematical, coding).

For these newly commissioned plants to run, accurate power forecasts are needed from the onset. These allow grid stability, good reserve management and efficient energy trading. Despite machine learning models having strong performances, they tend to require large volumes of site-specific data that new farms do not yet have. To overcome this data scarcity, we propose a novel transfer learning framework that clusters power output according to covariate meteorological features. Rather than training a single, general-purpose model, we thus forecast with an ensemble of expert models, each trained on a cluster. As these pre-trained models each specialise in a distinct weather pattern, they adapt efficiently to new sites and capture transferable, climate-dependent dynamics. Through the expert models' built-in calibration to seasonal and meteorological variability, we remove the industry-standard requirement of local measurements over a year. Our contributions are two-fold - we propose this novel framework and comprehensively evaluate it on eight offshore wind farms, achieving accurate cross-domain forecasting with under five months of site-specific data. Our experiments achieve a MAE of 3.52\\%, providing empirical verification that reliable forecasts do not require a full annual cycle. Beyond power forecasting, this climate-aware transfer learning method opens new opportunities for offshore wind applications such as early-stage wind resource assessment, where reducing data requirements can significantly accelerate project development whilst effectively mitigating its inherent risks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6c14\u8c61\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u65b0\u5efa\u6d77\u4e0a\u98ce\u7535\u573a\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u957f\u671f\u672c\u5730\u6570\u636e\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u529f\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u51c6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u5929\u6c14\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4ec5\u9700\u4e0d\u52305\u4e2a\u6708\u73b0\u573a\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8de8\u57df\u9884\u6d4b\uff08MAE\u4e3a3.52%\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u884c\u4e1a\u5bf9\u4e00\u5e74\u672c\u5730\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "motivation": "\u65b0\u5efa\u6d77\u4e0a\u98ce\u7535\u573a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u529f\u7387\u4e0e\u6c14\u8c61\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u7ad9\u70b9\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u521d\u671f\u529f\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u7535\u7f51\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u5907\u7528\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u4ea4\u6613\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u6839\u636e\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\uff08\u6c14\u8c61\u7279\u5f81\uff09\u5bf9\u98ce\u7535\u529f\u7387\u8f93\u51fa\u8fdb\u884c\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u805a\u7c7b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6c14\u5019\u76f8\u5173\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u65b0\u7ad9\u70b9\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u914d\uff0c\u5e76\u5185\u7f6e\u5bf9\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u548c\u6c14\u8c61\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516b\u4e2a\u6d77\u4e0a\u98ce\u7535\u573a\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u9700\u4e0d\u5230\u4e94\u4e2a\u6708\u7684\u7ad9\u70b9\u7279\u6709\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u529f\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\uff08MAE\uff09\u4e3a3.52%\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u5b8c\u6574\u5e74\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u4e5f\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u53ef\u9760\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6c14\u5019\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65b0\u5efa\u98ce\u7535\u573a\u65e9\u671f\u529f\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u62d3\u5c55\u81f3\u98ce\u8d44\u6e90\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b49\u524d\u671f\u5f00\u53d1\u73af\u8282\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u52a0\u901f\u9879\u76ee\u843d\u5730\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

Current weight-only PTQ methods primarily focus on the challenging sub-3-bit regime, where approaches often suffer significant accuracy degradation, typically requiring fine-tuning to achieve competitive performance. In this work, we revisit the fundamental characteristics of weight quantization and analyze the challenges in quantizing the residual matrix under low-rank approximation. We propose LoPRo, a novel fine-tuning-free PTQ algorithm that enhances residual matrix quantization by applying block-wise permutation and Walsh-Hadamard transformations to rotate columns of similar importance, while explicitly preserving the quantization accuracy of the most salient column blocks. Furthermore, we introduce a mixed-precision fast low-rank decomposition based on rank-1 sketch (R1SVD) to further minimize quantization costs. Experiments demonstrate that LoPRo outperforms existing fine-tuning-free PTQ methods at both 2-bit and 3-bit quantization, achieving accuracy comparable to fine-tuning baselines. Specifically, LoPRo achieves state-of-the-art quantization accuracy on LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 series models while delivering up to a 4$\\times$ speedup. In the MoE model Mixtral-8x7B, LoPRo completes quantization within 2.5 hours, simultaneously reducing perplexity by 0.4$\\downarrow$ and improving accuracy by 8\\%$\\uparrow$.

Existing editing methods for unimodal LLM rely on a rigid parameter-to-output mapping, which causes causal-underfit and causal-overfit in cascaded reasoning for Multimodal LLM (MLLM). In this paper, we reformulate MLLM editing as an out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization problem, where the goal is to discern semantic shift with factual shift and thus achieve robust editing among diverse cross-modal prompting. The key challenge of this OOD problem lies in identifying invariant causal trajectories that generalize accurately while suppressing spurious correlations. To address it, we propose ODEdit, a plug-and-play invariant learning based framework that optimizes the tripartite OOD risk objective to simultaneously enhance editing reliability, locality, and generality.We further introduce an edit trajectory invariant learning method, which integrates a total variation penalty into the risk minimization objective to stabilize edit trajectories against environmental variations.

This shortcoming has their root cause in using a set-oriented bisecting assessment criterion. We show that this shortcoming can be addressed by using a distributional kernel, instead of the set-oriented criterion; and the resultant clusters achieve a new distribution-oriented objective to maximize the total similarity of all clusters (TSC).

In addition, we adopt an explicit method to policy constraints by enabling Greedy Action Guidance (GAG). This is achieved through backtracking historical actions, which effectively enhances the policy update process. Our proposed method relies on providing the learning algorithm with accurate $k$-nearest-neighbor action value estimates and learning to design a fast-adaptable policy through policy constraints. We further propose the Instant Policy Update (IPU) mechanism, which enhances policy exploitation by systematically increasing the frequency of policy updates. We further discover that the early-stage training conservatism of the IRA method can alleviate the overestimation bias problem in value-based RL.

A critical privacy concern in federated learning is whether an adversary can recover raw data from shared gradients, a vulnerability known as deep leakage from gradients (DLG). However, most prior studies on the DLG problem focused on image or text data, and it remains an open question whether graphs can be effectively recovered, particularly when the graph structure and node features are uniquely entangled in GNNs. In this work, we first theoretically analyze the components in FGL and derive a crucial insight: once the graph structure is recovered, node features can be obtained through a closed-form recursive rule. Building on this analysis, we propose GraphDLG, a novel approach to recover raw training graphs from shared gradients in FGL, which can utilize randomly generated graphs or client-side training graphs as auxiliaries to enhance recovery. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphDLG outperforms existing solutions by successfully decoupling the graph structure and node features, achieving improvements of over 5.46% (by MSE) for node feature reconstruction and over 25.04% (by AUC) for graph structure reconstruction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faGraphDLG\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u8054\u90a6\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\uff08FGL\uff09\u5171\u4eab\u68af\u5ea6\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8282\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86FGL\u4e2d\u6df1\u5c42\u68af\u5ea6\u6cc4\u9732\uff08DLG\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709DLG\u653b\u51fb\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u6216\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u800c\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u5728GNN\u4e2d\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5176\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u6027\u5c1a\u5c5e\u672a\u77e5\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u8ba4\u8bc6\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790FGL\u4e2d\u68af\u5ea6\u5bf9\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7ed3\u6784\u6062\u590d\u540e\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u95ed\u5f0f\u9012\u63a8\u6c42\u89e3\uff1b\u636e\u6b64\u8bbe\u8ba1GraphDLG\u653b\u51fb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4f7f\u7528\u968f\u673a\u56fe\u6216\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u672c\u5730\u56fe\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u5148\u9a8c\u63d0\u5347\u6062\u590d\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "GraphDLG\u5728\u8282\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u5efa\uff08MSE\u964d\u4f4e5.46%\uff09\u548c\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u91cd\u5efa\uff08AUC\u63d0\u534725.04%\uff09\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u8026\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86FGL\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\uff0cGraphDLG\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u589e\u5f3aFGL\u9690\u79c1\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0e\u8b66\u793a\u3002"}}

We introduce a mathematical framework that jointly models architecture and weights in a Sobolev space, enabling a rigorous investigation into the role of neural network architecture in continual learning and its effect on the forgetting loss. We derive necessary conditions for the continual learning solution and prove that learning only model weights is insufficient to mitigate catastrophic forgetting under distribution shifts. Consequently, we prove that by learning the architecture and weights simultaneously at each task, we can reduce catastrophic forgetting.\n  To learn weights and architecture simultaneously, we formulate continual learning as a bilevel optimization problem: the upper level selects an optimal architecture for a given task, while the lower level computes optimal weights via dynamic programming over all tasks. To solve the upper level problem, we introduce a derivative-free direct search algorithm to determine the optimal architecture. Once found, we must transfer knowledge from the current architecture to the optimal one. However, the optimal architecture will result in a weights parameter space different from the current architecture (i.e., dimensions of weights matrices will not match). To bridge the dimensionality gap, we develop a low-rank transfer mechanism to map knowledge across architectures of mismatched dimensions.

We prove end-to-end grokking results for learning over-parameterized linear regression models using gradient descent with weight decay. Specifically, we prove that the following stages occur: (i) the model overfits the training data early during training; (ii) poor generalization persists long after overfitting has manifested; and (iii) the generalization error eventually becomes arbitrarily small. Moreover, we show, both theoretically and empirically, that grokking can be amplified or eliminated in a principled manner through proper hyperparameter tuning. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first rigorous quantitative bounds on the generalization delay (which we refer to as the \"grokking time\") in terms of training hyperparameters. Lastly, going beyond the linear setting, we empirically demonstrate that our quantitative bounds also capture the behavior of grokking on non-linear neural networks. Our results suggest that grokking is not an inherent failure mode of deep learning, but rather a consequence of specific training conditions, and thus does not require fundamental changes to the model architecture or learning algorithm to avoid.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5728\u5cad\u56de\u5f52\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7814\u7a76\u4e86'\u987f\u609f'\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5373\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u540e\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u624d\u5f00\u59cb\u6cdb\u5316\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u914d\u5408\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u65f6\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u987f\u609f\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u987f\u609f\u65f6\u95f4\uff08\u6cdb\u5316\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff09\u5173\u4e8e\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u754c\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u4e5f\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d'\u987f\u609f'\uff08grokking\uff09\u8fd9\u4e00\u53cd\u76f4\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\u2014\u2014\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u521d\u671f\u5feb\u901f\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3001\u968f\u540e\u957f\u671f\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u505c\u6ede\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5374\u7a81\u7136\u83b7\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u2014\u2014\u7684\u5185\u5728\u673a\u5236\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5e26\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff08\u63a8\u5bfc\u6cdb\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff09\u548c\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u987f\u609f\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u3001\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u7cfb\u6570\u7b49\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u9996\u6b21\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u987f\u609f\u65f6\u95f4\uff08generalization delay\uff09\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u5b9a\u91cf\u4e0a\u754c\uff1b\u8bc1\u660e\u987f\u609f\u5e76\u975e\u6a21\u578b\u672c\u8d28\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u53ef\u88ab\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u63a7\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff1a\u9002\u5f53\u8c03\u4f18\u53ef\u653e\u5927\u6216\u6d88\u9664\u987f\u609f\uff1b\u4e14\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u89c4\u5f8b\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u4ea6\u6709\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u987f\u609f\u4e0d\u662f\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7531\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6761\u4ef6\uff08\u5982\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u914d\u7f6e\uff09\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u6216\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u672c\u8eab\u5373\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u6216\u5229\u7528\u3002"}}

However, unlike classical numerical methods that offer established convergence guarantees, neural network-based approximations typically lack rigorous error bounds. Furthermore, the non-deterministic nature of their optimization makes it difficult to mathematically certify their accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a \"Learn and Verify\" framework that provides computable, mathematically rigorous error bounds for the solutions of differential equations. By combining a novel Doubly Smoothed Maximum (DSM) loss for training with interval arithmetic for verification, we compute rigorous a posteriori error bounds as machine-verifiable proofs.

Adding to this challenge is the fact that the anomaly data is rare and costly to label. To achieve this, we propose a multidirectional meta-learning algorithm -- at the inner level, the model aims to learn the manifold of the normal data (representation); at the outer level, the model is meta-tuned with a few anomaly samples to maximize the softmax confidence margin between the normal and anomaly samples (decision surface calibration), treating normals as in-distribution (ID) and anomalies as out-of-distribution (OOD). By iteratively repeating this process over multiple episodes of predominantly normal and a small number of anomaly samples, we realize a multidirectional meta-learning framework.

This is because CFD requires specialized expertise and is time-consuming and low throughput, making it difficult to support clinical trials. A deep learning model that maps IA morphology to biomechanical markers can address this, enabling physicians to obtain these markers in real time without performing CFD. Here, we show that a Graph Transformer model that incorporates temporal information, which is supervised by large CFD data, can accurately predict Wall Shear Stress (WSS) across the cardiac cycle from IA surface meshes. The model effectively captures the temporal variations of the WSS pattern, achieving a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of up to 0.981 and a maximum-based relative L2 error of 2.8%. Ablation studies and SOTA comparison confirmed its optimality. Further, as pulsatile CFD data is computationally expensive to generate and sample sizes are limited, we engaged a strategy of injecting a large amount of steady-state CFD data, which are extremely low-cost to generate, as augmentation. This approach enhances network performance substantially when pulsatile CFD data sample size is small. Our study provides a proof of concept that temporal sequences cardiovascular fluid mechanical parameters can be computed in real time using a deep learning model from the geometric mesh, and this is achievable even with small pulsatile CFD sample size. Our approach is likely applicable to other cardiovascular scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff08Graph Transformer\uff09\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u9885\u5185\u52a8\u8109\u7624\uff08IA\uff09\u8868\u9762\u7f51\u683c\u5b9e\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u6574\u4e2a\u5fc3\u52a8\u5468\u671f\u7684\u58c1\u9762\u526a\u5207\u5e94\u529b\uff08WSS\uff09\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8017\u65f6\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6d41\u4f53\u529b\u5b66\uff08CFD\uff09\u6a21\u62df\uff1b\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u5229\u7528\u7a33\u6001CFD\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u8109\u52a8CFD\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u4ecd\u53d6\u5f97\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff08SSIM\u8fbe0.981\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9L2\u8bef\u5dee2.8%\uff09\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u8f6c\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "CFD\u867d\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u53cd\u6620\u9885\u5185\u52a8\u8109\u7624\u8fdb\u5c55\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u6d41\u4f53\u529b\u5b66\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982WSS\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u56e0\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u5bb6\u3001\u8017\u65f6\u4f4e\u6548\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\uff1b\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u3001\u65e0\u9700CFD\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u878d\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u56fe\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5IA\u8868\u9762\u7f51\u683c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u5168\u5fc3\u52a8\u5468\u671fWSS\u5206\u5e03\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u7a33\u6001CFD\u6570\u636e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u8109\u52a8CFD\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7SSIM\u548c\u76f8\u5bf9L2\u8bef\u5dee\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u5c55\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0eSOTA\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728WSS\u65f6\u7a7a\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SSIM\u6700\u9ad80.981\u3001\u6700\u5927\u76f8\u5bf9L2\u8bef\u5dee\u4ec52.8%\uff1b\u7a33\u6001CFD\u589e\u5f3a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u8109\u52a8CFD\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u6d88\u878d\u4e0eSOTA\u5bf9\u6bd4\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4ec5\u51ed\u51e0\u4f55\u7f51\u683c\u5373\u53ef\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u65f6\u5e8f\u6d41\u4f53\u529b\u5b66\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8109\u52a8CFD\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5411\u5176\u4ed6\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u75be\u75c5\u62d3\u5c55\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

While on-policy reinforcement learning can reduce forgetting, it requires explicit reward functions that are often unavailable. Learning from expert demonstrations, the primary alternative, is dominated by supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which is inherently off-policy. We introduce Self-Distillation Fine-Tuning (SDFT), a simple method that enables on-policy learning directly from demonstrations. SDFT leverages in-context learning by using a demonstration-conditioned model as its own teacher, generating on-policy training signals that preserve prior capabilities while acquiring new skills. Across skill learning and knowledge acquisition tasks, SDFT consistently outperforms SFT, achieving higher new-task accuracy while substantially reducing catastrophic forgetting. In sequential learning experiments, SDFT enables a single model to accumulate multiple skills over time without performance regression, establishing on-policy distillation as a practical path to continual learning from demonstrations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u81ea\u84b8\u998f\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SDFT\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u4e13\u5bb6\u793a\u8303\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5728\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u662f\u79bb\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u53c8\u4f9d\u8d56\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u84b8\u998f\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SDFT\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u793a\u8303\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u8eab\u6559\u5e08\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u751f\u6210\u5728\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "SDFT\u5728\u6280\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u83b7\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8eSFT\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u5927\u5e45\u7f13\u89e3\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff1b\u5728\u987a\u5e8f\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u7d2f\u79ef\u591a\u4e2a\u6280\u80fd\u800c\u4e0d\u51fa\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "SDFT\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u793a\u8303\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}
