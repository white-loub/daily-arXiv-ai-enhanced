Abstract: We present CageDroneRF (CDRF), a large-scale benchmark for Radio-Frequency (RF) drone detection and identification built from real-world captures and systematically generated synthetic variants. CDRF addresses the scarcity and limited diversity of existing RF datasets by coupling extensive raw recordings with a principled augmentation pipeline that (i) precisely controls Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), (ii) injects interfering emitters, and (iii) applies frequency shifts with label-consistent bounding-box transformations for detection. This dataset spans a wide range of contemporary drone models, many unavailable in current public datasets, and acquisition conditions, derived from data collected at the Rowan University campus and within a controlled RF-cage facility. CDRF is released with interoperable open-source tools for data generation, preprocessing, augmentation, and evaluation that also operate on existing public benchmarks. CDRF enables standardized benchmarking for classification, open-set recognition, and object detection, supporting rigorous comparisons and reproducible pipelines. By releasing this comprehensive benchmark and tooling, CDRF aims to accelerate progress toward robust, generalizable RF perception models.

*Yingyan Xu,Pramod Rao,Sebastian Weiss,Gaspard Zoss,Markus Gross,Christian Theobalt,Marc Habermann,Derek Bradley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需OLAT（逐光照明）数据即可实现高质量3D头像重光照的新方法，通过两阶段学习将普通单/多视角图像重建的3D高斯溅射模型映射为可重光照的物理反射参数模型，支持跨主体泛化与单图适配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高质量重光照方法依赖复杂OLAT采集，限制了实际应用；亟需一种仅用常规单/多视角图像即可构建可重光照3D头像的通用方法。

Method: 提出两阶段广义可重光照3D高斯头像模型：第一阶段在无OLAT的多视角数据集上自监督学习flat-lit 3DGS，并引入数据集级光照编码实现光照对齐；第二阶段在小规模OLAT数据上学习从flat-lit高斯参数到物理反射参数（如BRDF）的映射。

Result: 在未见主体上实现高质量重光照与新视角合成，仅需单张输入图像即可拟合；相比依赖OLAT的方法大幅降低采集门槛，同时保持跨主体泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法解耦了建模与重光照学习，使3D高斯溅射真正适用于真实场景中的轻量、通用数字人重光照任务。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a standard approach to reconstruct and render photorealistic 3D head avatars. A major challenge is to relight the avatars to match any scene illumination. For high quality relighting, existing methods require subjects to be captured under complex time-multiplexed illumination, such as one-light-at-a-time (OLAT). We propose a new generalized relightable 3D Gaussian head model that can relight any subject observed in a single- or multi-view images without requiring OLAT data for that subject. Our core idea is to learn a mapping from flat-lit 3DGS avatars to corresponding relightable Gaussian parameters for that avatar. Our model consists of two stages: a first stage that models flat-lit 3DGS avatars without OLAT lighting, and a second stage that learns the mapping to physically-based reflectance parameters for high-quality relighting. This two-stage design allows us to train the first stage across diverse existing multi-view datasets without OLAT lighting ensuring cross-subject generalization, where we learn a dataset-specific lighting code for self-supervised lighting alignment. Subsequently, the second stage can be trained on a significantly smaller dataset of subjects captured under OLAT illumination. Together, this allows our method to generalize well and relight any subject from the first stage as if we had captured them under OLAT lighting. Furthermore, we can fit our model to unseen subjects from as little as a single image, allowing several applications in novel view synthesis and relighting for digital avatars.

### [4] [Mass Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models with Concept Hierarchy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03305)
*Jiahang Tu,Ye Li,Yiming Wu,Hanbin Zhao,Chao Zhang,Hui Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于超类型-子类型概念层次结构的概念擦除方法，通过分组联合抑制语义相似的概念，并引入SuPLoRA技术在擦除过程中保持超类型生成能力，提升了多概念擦除的效率与效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型的概念擦除方法在擦除多个概念时效率低、效果差，且易损害整体生成质量，亟需更高效、可扩展的多概念协同擦除机制。

Method: 构建超类型-子类型概念层次结构，将语义相关子概念聚类到同一超类型下；提出组式联合擦除策略，共享一组可学习参数；结合标准扩散正则化保留未掩码区域去噪能力；设计Supertype-Preserving Low-Rank Adaptation（SuPLoRA），冻结下投影矩阵以编码超类型信息，仅更新上投影矩阵。

Result: 在跨领域（名人、物体、色情内容）多概念同步擦除的更具挑战性的新基准上验证了方法的有效性与鲁棒性；理论分析和实验表明SuPLoRA显著缓解了因过度擦除子类型而导致的超类型生成性能下降。

Conclusion: 所提层次化分组擦除框架及SuPLoRA适配策略，兼顾擦除精度、效率与生成保真度，为扩散模型的安全可控生成提供了可扩展的新范式。

Abstract: The success of diffusion models has raised concerns about the generation of unsafe or harmful content, prompting concept erasure approaches that fine-tune modules to suppress specific concepts while preserving general generative capabilities. However, as the number of erased concepts grows, these methods often become inefficient and ineffective, since each concept requires a separate set of fine-tuned parameters and may degrade the overall generation quality. In this work, we propose a supertype-subtype concept hierarchy that organizes erased concepts into a parent-child structure. Each erased concept is treated as a child node, and semantically related concepts (e.g., macaw, and bald eagle) are grouped under a shared parent node, referred to as a supertype concept (e.g., bird). Rather than erasing concepts individually, we introduce an effective and efficient group-wise suppression method, where semantically similar concepts are grouped and erased jointly by sharing a single set of learnable parameters. During the erasure phase, standard diffusion regularization is applied to preserve denoising process in unmasked regions. To mitigate the degradation of supertype generation caused by excessive erasure of semantically related subtypes, we propose a novel method called Supertype-Preserving Low-Rank Adaptation (SuPLoRA), which encodes the supertype concept information in the frozen down-projection matrix and updates only the up-projection matrix during erasure. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of SuPLoRA in mitigating generation performance degradation. We construct a more challenging benchmark that requires simultaneous erasure of concepts across diverse domains, including celebrities, objects, and pornographic content.

### [5] [Bayesian Monocular Depth Refinement via Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03869)
*Arun Muthukkumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MDENeRF 是一种结合单目深度估计与神经辐射场（NeRF）不确定性的迭代框架，通过贝叶斯融合提升深度图的几何细节和全局结构一致性，在 SUN RGB-D 数据集上取得先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单目深度估计方法生成的深度图过于平滑，缺乏精细几何细节，难以满足高精度场景理解需求。

Method: 提出 MDENeRF 框架：1）用单目模型提供全局结构先验；2）在扰动视角下训练 NeRF，并从体渲染过程推导像素级不确定性；3）对单目深度与 NeRF 深度进行贝叶斯融合，迭代注入高频细节。

Result: 在 SUN RGB-D 室内场景数据集上，关键指标优于现有方法，显著提升了深度图的细节保真度与结构完整性。

Conclusion: 融合 NeRF 不确定性与单目先验的迭代贝叶斯策略，能有效平衡局部细节与全局几何一致性，为单目深度估计提供了新范式。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation has applications in many fields, such as autonomous navigation and extended reality, making it an essential computer vision task. However, current methods often produce smooth depth maps that lack the fine geometric detail needed for accurate scene understanding. We propose MDENeRF, an iterative framework that refines monocular depth estimates using depth information from Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). MDENeRF consists of three components: (1) an initial monocular estimate for global structure, (2) a NeRF trained on perturbed viewpoints, with per-pixel uncertainty, and (3) Bayesian fusion of the noisy monocular and NeRF depths. We derive NeRF uncertainty from the volume rendering process to iteratively inject high-frequency fine details. Meanwhile, our monocular prior maintains global structure. We demonstrate superior performance on key metrics and experiments using indoor scenes from the SUN RGB-D dataset.

### [6] [VLM4VLA: Revisiting Vision-Language-Models in Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03309)
*Jianke Zhang,Xiaoyu Chen,Qiuyue Wang,Mingsheng Li,Yanjiang Guo,Yucheng Hu,Jiajun Zhang,Shuai Bai,Junyang Lin,Jianyu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出VLM4VLA方法，系统研究了视觉语言模型（VLM）的选择与能力如何影响下游视觉-语言-动作（VLA）策略性能，发现VLM通用能力并非良好预测指标，视觉模块是主要瓶颈，并揭示了预训练目标与具身动作规划需求之间存在领域鸿沟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视VLM选择与能力如何影响下游VLA策略性能这一被忽视的基础问题，挑战关于VLM通用能力可直接迁移至具身控制的常见假设。

Method: 提出轻量级适配框架VLM4VLA，仅引入少量可学习参数将通用VLM转化为VLA策略；在三个基准上进行广泛实验；对七个辅助具身任务进行微调以分析特定具身能力的影响；开展模态级消融分析。

Result: VLM初始化始终优于从零训练，但其通用能力不能有效预测下游控制性能；提升特定具身技能不保证控制性能提升；视觉模块而非语言模块是性能瓶颈；向视觉编码器注入控制相关监督信号能稳定提升性能。

Conclusion: 标准VLM通用能力对具身控制而言必要但不充分；当前VLM预训练目标与具身动作规划存在本质领域鸿沟；改进视觉编码器是提升VLA性能的关键路径。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, which integrate pretrained large Vision-Language Models (VLM) into their policy backbone, are gaining significant attention for their promising generalization capabilities. This paper revisits a fundamental yet seldom systematically studied question: how VLM choice and competence translate to downstream VLA policies performance? We introduce VLM4VLA, a minimal adaptation pipeline that converts general-purpose VLMs into VLA policies using only a small set of new learnable parameters for fair and efficient comparison. Despite its simplicity, VLM4VLA proves surprisingly competitive with more sophisticated network designs. Through extensive empirical studies on various downstream tasks across three benchmarks, we find that while VLM initialization offers a consistent benefit over training from scratch, a VLM's general capabilities are poor predictors of its downstream task performance. This challenges common assumptions, indicating that standard VLM competence is necessary but insufficient for effective embodied control. We further investigate the impact of specific embodied capabilities by fine-tuning VLMs on seven auxiliary embodied tasks (e.g., embodied QA, visual pointing, depth estimation). Contrary to intuition, improving a VLM's performance on specific embodied skills does not guarantee better downstream control performance. Finally, modality-level ablations identify the visual module in VLM, rather than the language component, as the primary performance bottleneck. We demonstrate that injecting control-relevant supervision into the vision encoder of the VLM yields consistent gains, even when the encoder remains frozen during downstream fine-tuning. This isolates a persistent domain gap between current VLM pretraining objectives and the requirements of embodied action-planning.

### [7] [Choreographing a World of Dynamic Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04194)
*Yanzhe Lyu,Chen Geng,Karthik Dharmarajan,Yunzhi Zhang,Hadi Alzayer,Shangzhe Wu,Jiajun Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为CHORD的通用生成框架，用于 choreographing（编排）动态物体与场景并合成4D动态现象。该方法通过蒸馏视频生成模型中的运动信息，摆脱了传统规则驱动方法的类别限制和数据驱动方法对大规模标注数据的依赖，实现了类别无关、通用且灵活的4D动态建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于规则的图形管线依赖类别特定启发式，劳动密集且不可扩展；现有学习方法需大量标注数据，难以覆盖所有目标类别。

Method: 提出基于蒸馏的通用生成流水线，从2D视频的欧拉表示中提取拉格朗日运动信息，继承视频生成模型的泛化能力。

Result: 成功生成多物体、多样化的4D动态场景；在生成质量与泛化性上优于现有方法；可拓展应用于机器人操作策略生成。

Conclusion: CHORD是一种类别无关、通用且实用的4D动态建模方法， bridging video generation and 4D scene dynamics synthesis.

Abstract: Dynamic objects in our physical 4D (3D + time) world are constantly evolving, deforming, and interacting with other objects, leading to diverse 4D scene dynamics. In this paper, we present a universal generative pipeline, CHORD, for CHOReographing Dynamic objects and scenes and synthesizing this type of phenomena. Traditional rule-based graphics pipelines to create these dynamics are based on category-specific heuristics, yet are labor-intensive and not scalable. Recent learning-based methods typically demand large-scale datasets, which may not cover all object categories in interest. Our approach instead inherits the universality from the video generative models by proposing a distillation-based pipeline to extract the rich Lagrangian motion information hidden in the Eulerian representations of 2D videos. Our method is universal, versatile, and category-agnostic. We demonstrate its effectiveness by conducting experiments to generate a diverse range of multi-body 4D dynamics, show its advantage compared to existing methods, and demonstrate its applicability in generating robotics manipulation policies.

*Yun-Hao Zhang,I-Hsien Ting,Dario Liberona,Yun-Hsiu Liu,Kazunori Minetaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究利用基于深度学习的图像识别技术，构建卷积神经网络（CNN）模型，实现白虾捕捞后自动分类，以提升分拣准确性、效率与一致性，从而维持虾体新鲜度并改善产品外观。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决虾类捕捞后新鲜度快速下降及软壳虾在烹饪或冷冻后头身分离影响外观和消费者感知的问题。

Method: 采用卷积神经网络（CNN）进行白虾图像识别与自动分类，替代人工分拣。

Result: 提升了分类准确率、处理效率和一致性，缩短加工时间，有助于保持虾体新鲜度并满足客户对产品外观与品质的要求。

Conclusion: 基于CNN的自动图像识别技术可有效应用于水产加工环节，为智慧渔业提供可行的技术支撑。

Abstract: With the integration of information technology into aquaculture, production has become more stable and continues to grow annually. As consumer demand for high-quality aquatic products rises, freshness and appearance integrity are key concerns. In shrimp-based processed foods, freshness declines rapidly post-harvest, and soft-shell shrimp often suffer from head-body separation after cooking or freezing, affecting product appearance and consumer perception. To address these issues, this study leverages deep learning-based image recognition for automated classification of white shrimp immediately after harvest. A convolutional neural network (CNN) model replaces manual sorting, enhancing classification accuracy, efficiency, and consistency. By reducing processing time, this technology helps maintain freshness and ensures that shrimp transportation businesses meet customer demands more effectively.

### [9] [Higher order PCA-like rotation-invariant features for detailed shape descriptors modulo rotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03326)
*Jarek Duda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了PCA的扩展方法，通过高阶张量（如三阶中心矩）和多项式-高斯混合模型来更精确地描述复杂形状，并构建旋转不变特征，适用于分子形状描述、2D/3D物体识别及形状相似性度量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PCA仅用二阶协方差矩阵近似形状为椭球，难以刻画真实世界中更复杂的形状结构，因此需要更高精度、旋转不变的形状描述方法。

Method: 将PCA推广至高阶中心矩张量（如p_abc）以及多项式乘以高斯函数的可解码形状描述符，构造其旋转不变量（如迹、谱不变量等）。

Result: 实现了任意高精度的旋转不变形状描述，支持无需优化旋转角度的高效形状比较，在分子建模、2D/3D物体识别等任务中具备实用潜力。

Conclusion: 该扩展显著提升了形状建模的表达能力与旋转不变性，为形状分析提供了更灵活、准确且计算友好的数学框架。

Abstract: PCA can be used for rotation invariant features, describing a shape with its $p_{ab}=E[(x_i-E[x_a])(x_b-E[x_b])]$ covariance matrix approximating shape by ellipsoid, allowing for rotation invariants like its traces of powers. However, real shapes are usually much more complicated, hence there is proposed its extension to e.g. $p_{abc}=E[(x_a-E[x_a])(x_b-E[x_b])(x_c-E[x_c])]$ order-3 or higher tensors describing central moments, or polynomial times Gaussian allowing decodable shape descriptors of arbitrarily high accuracy, and their analogous rotation invariants. Its practical applications could be rotation-invariant features to include shape modulo rotation e.g. for molecular shape descriptors, or for up to rotation object recognition in 2D images/3D scans, or shape similarity metric allowing their inexpensive comparison (modulo rotation) without costly optimization over rotations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了MMErroR多模态错误检测基准，包含2013个样本，覆盖6大领域24个子领域，旨在评估视觉-语言模型（VLMs）识别和分类推理错误的能力；实验表明当前最优模型（Gemini-3.0-Pro）仅能达到66.47%的错误类型分类准确率，揭示了多模态推理中错误识别的严峻挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLMs虽在多模态任务上性能提升，但其是否真正理解内容、能否识别推理过程中的错误及错误类型尚不明确，亟需一个聚焦于推理过程而非答案正确性的新基准。

Method: 构建MMErroR基准：2013个样本，每样本嵌入一种连贯的单推理错误，覆盖6个顶层领域、24个子领域；设计任务为检测错误并分类错误类型，兼顾视觉与语言上下文；对20个先进VLMs进行系统评测。

Result: 最佳模型Gemini-3.0-Pro在错误类型分类任务上准确率仅为66.47%，其余模型表现更差；结果表明当前VLMs在多模态推理错误识别方面能力严重不足。

Conclusion: MMErroR揭示了VLMs在推理过程理解上的根本局限，强调需从答案导向转向过程导向评估，并为未来提升多模态推理鲁棒性与可解释性提供新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have improved performance in multi-modal learning, raising the question of whether these models truly understand the content they process. Crucially, can VLMs detect when a reasoning process is wrong and identify its error type? To answer this, we present MMErroR, a multi-modal benchmark of 2,013 samples, each embedding a single coherent reasoning error. These samples span 24 subdomains across six top-level domains, ensuring broad coverage and taxonomic richness. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on answer correctness, MMErroR targets a process-level, error-centric evaluation that requires models to detect incorrect reasoning and classify the error type within both visual and linguistic contexts. We evaluate 20 advanced VLMs, even the best model (Gemini-3.0-Pro) classifies the error in only 66.47\% of cases, underscoring the challenge of identifying erroneous reasoning. Furthermore, the ability to accurately identify errors offers valuable insights into the capabilities of multi-modal reasoning models. Project Page: https://mmerror-benchmark.github.io

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了HairGuard框架，用于在3D视觉任务中恢复细粒度的软边界细节（如头发），通过深度修复网络、深度引导前向扭曲、生成式场景绘制和自适应颜色融合等模块，在单目深度估计、立体图像/视频转换和新视角合成任务中实现了软边界区域的SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软边界（如细发）在自然和计算机生成图像中常见，但因前景与背景线索混叠模糊，给3D视觉带来挑战。

Method: 提出HairGuard框架：1）基于图像抠图数据集构建新数据流水线；2）设计带门控残差模块的深度修复网络，精准优化软边界区域深度；3）在视图合成中采用深度引导前向扭曲保留纹理，结合生成式场景绘制填补遮挡区并消除背景伪影；4）引入自适应颜色融合模块整合结果。

Result: 在单目深度估计、立体图像/视频转换和新视角合成任务上均达到SOTA性能，尤其在软边界区域提升显著。

Conclusion: HairGuard有效解决了3D视觉中软边界建模难题，各模块可即插即用，兼顾全局几何一致性与局部细节保真度。

Abstract: Soft boundaries, like thin hairs, are commonly observed in natural and computer-generated imagery, but they remain challenging for 3D vision due to the ambiguous mixing of foreground and background cues. This paper introduces Guardians of the Hair (HairGuard), a framework designed to recover fine-grained soft boundary details in 3D vision tasks. Specifically, we first propose a novel data curation pipeline that leverages image matting datasets for training and design a depth fixer network to automatically identify soft boundary regions. With a gated residual module, the depth fixer refines depth precisely around soft boundaries while maintaining global depth quality, allowing plug-and-play integration with state-of-the-art depth models. For view synthesis, we perform depth-based forward warping to retain high-fidelity textures, followed by a generative scene painter that fills disoccluded regions and eliminates redundant background artifacts within soft boundaries. Finally, a color fuser adaptively combines warped and inpainted results to produce novel views with consistent geometry and fine-grained details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HairGuard achieves state-of-the-art performance across monocular depth estimation, stereo image/video conversion, and novel view synthesis, with significant improvements in soft boundary regions.

### [12] [RiskCueBench: Benchmarking Anticipatory Reasoning from Early Risk Cues in Video-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03369)
*Sha Luo,Yogesh Prabhu,Tim Ossowski,Kaiping Chen,Junjie Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新的视频理解基准RiskCueBench，专注于从早期视觉信号中预测未来风险事件，而非依赖完整视频序列（含事故本身），以更贴近现实场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频风险评估数据集通常提供包含事故本身的完整视频，降低了任务难度，无法反映真实世界中需提前预警的需求。

Method: 构建RiskCueBench基准，对视频进行精细标注，定义并定位‘风险信号片段’——即最早预示潜在安全问题的时间片段。

Result: 实验表明当前模型在解读动态演变场景及基于早期视觉线索预测未来风险方面存在显著能力差距。

Conclusion: RiskCueBench揭示了视频风险预测模型在实际部署中的关键挑战，强调需提升模型对早期风险信号的感知与推理能力。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of video centered social media, the ability to anticipate risky events from visual data is a promising direction for ensuring public safety and preventing real world accidents. Prior work has extensively studied supervised video risk assessment across domains such as driving, protests, and natural disasters. However, many existing datasets provide models with access to the full video sequence, including the accident itself, which substantially reduces the difficulty of the task. To better reflect real world conditions, we introduce a new video understanding benchmark RiskCueBench in which videos are carefully annotated to identify a risk signal clip, defined as the earliest moment that indicates a potential safety concern. Experimental results reveal a significant gap in current systems ability to interpret evolving situations and anticipate future risky events from early visual signals, highlighting important challenges for deploying video risk prediction models in practice.

Abstract: The advancements in the field of AI is increasingly giving rise to various threats. One of the most prominent of them is the synthesis and misuse of Deepfakes. To sustain trust in this digital age, detection and tagging of deepfakes is very necessary. In this paper, a novel architecture for Deepfake detection in images and videos is presented. The architecture uses cross attention between spatial and frequency domain features along with a blood detection module to classify an image as real or fake. This paper aims to develop a unified architecture and provide insights into each step. Though this approach we achieve results better than SOTA, specifically 99.80%, 99.88% AUC on FF++ and Celeb-DF upon using Swin Transformer and BERT and 99.55, 99.38 while using EfficientNet-B4 and BERT. The approach also generalizes very well achieving great cross dataset results as well.

*Matteo Dunnhofer,Christian Micheloni,Kohitij Kar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了猕猴下颞叶（IT）皮层在自然视频观看中的动态响应特性，并对比了静态、循环和视频神经网络模型对IT神经反应的预测能力。结果发现，尽管视频模型在后期响应阶段有所改进，但所有ANN模型均无法像IT神经群体那样在保持运动但去除形状和纹理的“外观无关”视频变体上实现泛化，表明当前视频模型仅捕捉外观依赖的动态，而非IT中体现的外观不变的动态计算。

Motivation: 探究猕猴IT皮层在动态视觉刺激下的响应是否超越简单的时间展开或浅层时间池化，而体现更丰富的动态计算能力，并评估现有ANN模型（尤其是视频模型）是否能真实反映这种生物动态机制。

Method: 比较猕猴IT神经活动与静态、循环及视频神经网络模型在自然视频刺激下的响应预测性能；进一步设计‘外观无关’视频变体（保留运动、去除形状/纹理），通过解码器泛化性检验各模型与IT在动态表征上的差异。

Result: 视频模型仅在IT响应晚期带来小幅预测提升；在‘外观无关’测试中，IT神经群体活动能成功泛化，而所有ANN模型均失败。

Conclusion: 当前视频ANN模型主要捕捉外观绑定的动态特征，未能建模IT中关键的外观不变动态计算，亟需引入符合生物时间统计与不变性的新训练目标。

Abstract: Feedforward artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained on static images remain the dominant models of the the primate ventral visual stream, yet they are intrinsically limited to static computations. The primate world is dynamic, and the macaque ventral visual pathways, specifically the inferior temporal (IT) cortex not only supports object recognition but also encodes object motion velocity during naturalistic video viewing. Does IT's temporal responses reflect nothing more than time-unfolded feedforward transformations, framewise features with shallow temporal pooling, or do they embody richer dynamic computations? We tested this by comparing macaque IT responses during naturalistic videos against static, recurrent, and video-based ANN models. Video models provided modest improvements in neural predictivity, particularly at later response stages, raising the question of what kind of dynamics they capture. To probe this, we applied a stress test: decoders trained on naturalistic videos were evaluated on "appearance-free" variants that preserve motion but remove shape and texture. IT population activity generalized across this manipulation, but all ANN classes failed. Thus, current video models better capture appearance-bound dynamics rather than the appearance-invariant temporal computations expressed in IT, underscoring the need for new objectives that encode biological temporal statistics and invariances.

TL;DR: 本文提出视觉文字谜题作为评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）深层推理能力的新挑战，并构建多语言基准Eye-Q，揭示当前VLMs在抽象推理与跨语言理解方面存在显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLMs在标准基准上表现良好，但多依赖表层识别，缺乏深层推理能力；需新任务评估其发现隐式视觉线索、生成修正假设及映射感知证据到非字面概念的能力。

Method: 提出视觉文字谜题任务，构建包含1343道谜题的多语言基准Eye-Q（涵盖英语、波斯语、阿拉伯语及跨语言题型），采用开放性、以人为本的评估协议，考察模型在轻量辅助下的假设生成与修正能力。

Result: 当前最优VLM在Eye-Q上最高准确率仅60.27%，尤其在抽象和跨语言谜题上表现更差，暴露出其在构建与搜索恰当概念表征以实现灵活图像到短语推理方面的严重局限。

Conclusion: 视觉文字谜题是检验VLM深层视觉理解能力的有效新范式；Eye-Q基准揭示了现有模型在抽象推理、选择性注意、关联推断等方面的本质瓶颈，为未来研究指明方向。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved strong performance on standard vision-language benchmarks, yet often rely on surface-level recognition rather than deeper reasoning. We propose visual word puzzles as a challenging alternative, as they require discovering implicit visual cues, generating and revising hypotheses, and mapping perceptual evidence to non-literal concepts in ways that are difficult to solve via literal grounding, OCR-heavy shortcuts, or simple retrieval-style matching. We introduce Eye-Q, a multilingual benchmark designed to assess this form of complex visual understanding. Eye-Q contains 1,343 puzzles in which a model observes a conceptually dense scene with a brief description and must infer a specific target word or phrase. The puzzles are intentionally unstructured and cue-implicit, with distractors and contextual relationships that demand selective attention, abstraction, and associative inference. The benchmark spans English, Persian, Arabic, and cross-lingual puzzles. We evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs using an open-ended, human-aligned protocol that probes hypothesis formation and revision under lightweight assistance. Results reveal substantial performance gaps, especially on abstract and cross-lingual puzzles, highlighting limitations in current models' ability to construct and search over appropriate conceptual representations for flexible image-to-phrase inference; maximum accuracy reaches only 60.27%.

*Xiangdong Hu,Yangyang Jiang,Qin Hu,Xiaojun Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出GAMBIT框架，通过构建游戏化场景诱导多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在推理过程中主动完成越狱，显著提升对具备思维链能力模型的攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有针对MLLMs的对抗攻击未充分利用模型自身的推理激励机制，在具备思维链（Chain-of-Thought）能力的模型上效果较差；本文旨在探索如何影响模型认知阶段决策，促使其主动完成越狱。

Method: 提出GAMBIT（Gamified Adversarial Multimodal Breakout via Instructional Traps）框架：分解并重组有害视觉语义，构建游戏化场景，驱动模型在‘参与游戏’过程中探索、重构恶意意图并作答，从而形成结构化推理链，降低其安全注意力。

Result: 在Gemini 2.5 Flash、QvQ-MAX和GPT-4o等主流推理与非推理MLLMs上取得高攻击成功率（ASR），分别达92.13%、91.20%和85.87%，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 利用模型自身推理激励构建游戏化陷阱可有效削弱MLLMs的安全对齐，尤其对具备思维链能力的模型更具威胁，揭示了当前安全机制在认知层面的脆弱性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have become widely deployed, yet their safety alignment remains fragile under adversarial inputs. Previous work has shown that increasing inference steps can disrupt safety mechanisms and lead MLLMs to generate attacker-desired harmful content. However, most existing attacks focus on increasing the complexity of the modified visual task itself and do not explicitly leverage the model's own reasoning incentives. This leads to them underperforming on reasoning models (Models with Chain-of-Thoughts) compared to non-reasoning ones (Models without Chain-of-Thoughts). If a model can think like a human, can we influence its cognitive-stage decisions so that it proactively completes a jailbreak? To validate this idea, we propose GAMBI} (Gamified Adversarial Multimodal Breakout via Instructional Traps), a novel multimodal jailbreak framework that decomposes and reassembles harmful visual semantics, then constructs a gamified scene that drives the model to explore, reconstruct intent, and answer as part of winning the game. The resulting structured reasoning chain increases task complexity in both vision and text, positioning the model as a participant whose goal pursuit reduces safety attention and induces it to answer the reconstructed malicious query. Extensive experiments on popular reasoning and non-reasoning MLLMs demonstrate that GAMBIT achieves high Attack Success Rates (ASR), reaching 92.13% on Gemini 2.5 Flash, 91.20% on QvQ-MAX, and 85.87% on GPT-4o, significantly outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: WeedRepFormer验证了结构重参数化在轻量级多任务农业视觉模型中的有效性，为田间实时应用提供了高效可行的解决方案。

Abstract: We present WeedRepFormer, a lightweight multi-task Vision Transformer designed for simultaneous waterhemp segmentation and gender classification. Existing agricultural models often struggle to balance the fine-grained feature extraction required for biological attribute classification with the efficiency needed for real-time deployment. To address this, WeedRepFormer systematically integrates structural reparameterization across the entire architecture - comprising a Vision Transformer backbone, a Lite R-ASPP decoder, and a novel reparameterizable classification head - to decouple training-time capacity from inference-time latency. We also introduce a comprehensive waterhemp dataset containing 10,264 annotated frames from 23 plants. On this benchmark, WeedRepFormer achieves 92.18% mIoU for segmentation and 81.91% accuracy for gender classification using only 3.59M parameters and 3.80 GFLOPs. At 108.95 FPS, our model outperforms the state-of-the-art iFormer-T by 4.40% in classification accuracy while maintaining competitive segmentation performance and significantly reducing parameter count by 1.9x.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出FROST-Drive，一种端到端自动驾驶模型，通过冻结视觉语言模型（VLM）预训练视觉编码器的权重，结合Transformer适配器与GRU解码器，并设计RFS导向损失函数，在Waymo Open E2E数据集上显著提升对长尾场景的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端模型常对视觉编码器进行全量微调，导致其过度特化于训练数据、泛化能力受限；本文质疑该范式必要性，主张保留VLM预训练编码器的广义世界知识以提升驾驶任务鲁棒性。

Method: 提出FROST-Drive架构：冻结VLM视觉编码器；引入Transformer适配器实现多模态融合；采用GRU解码器生成平滑轨迹点；设计直接优化Rater Feedback Score（RFS）的定制损失函数。

Result: 在Waymo Open E2E数据集（专为长尾场景构建）上，FROST-Drive显著优于全量微调基线模型，验证了冻结编码器策略在泛化性和鲁棒轨迹规划上的优势。

Conclusion: 保留强大VLM编码器的通用表征能力，比深度领域微调更有利于构建泛化性强、鲁棒性高的端到端自动驾驶模型，为现实世界视觉模型开发提供了新思路。

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) models in autonomous driving aim to directly map sensor inputs to control commands, but their ability to generalize to novel and complex scenarios remains a key challenge. The common practice of fully fine-tuning the vision encoder on driving datasets potentially limits its generalization by causing the model to specialize too heavily in the training data. This work challenges the necessity of this training paradigm. We propose FROST-Drive, a novel E2E architecture designed to preserve and leverage the powerful generalization capabilities of a pretrained vision encoder from a Vision-Language Model (VLM). By keeping the encoder's weights frozen, our approach directly transfers the rich, generalized world knowledge from the VLM to the driving task. Our model architecture combines this frozen encoder with a transformer-based adapter for multimodal fusion and a GRU-based decoder for smooth waypoint generation. Furthermore, we introduce a custom loss function designed to directly optimize for Rater Feedback Score (RFS), a metric that prioritizes robust trajectory planning. We conduct extensive experiments on Waymo Open E2E Dataset, a large-scale datasets deliberately curated to capture the long-tail scenarios, demonstrating that our frozen-encoder approach significantly outperforms models that employ full fine-tuning. Our results provide substantial evidence that preserving the broad knowledge of a capable VLM is a more effective strategy for achieving robust, generalizable driving performance than intensive domain-specific adaptation. This offers a new pathway for developing vision-based models that can better handle the complexities of real-world application domains.

Abstract: Scalability and data sparsity remain critical bottlenecks for collaborative filtering on massive interaction datasets. This work investigates the latent geometry of user preferences using the MovieLens 32M dataset, implementing a high-performance, parallelized Alternating Least Squares (ALS) framework. Through extensive hyperparameter optimization, we demonstrate that constrained low-rank models significantly outperform higher dimensional counterparts in generalization, achieving an optimal balance between Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and ranking precision. We visualize the learned embedding space to reveal the unsupervised emergence of semantic genre clusters, confirming that the model captures deep structural relationships solely from interaction data. Finally, we validate the system's practical utility in a cold-start scenario, introducing a tunable scoring parameter to manage the trade-off between popularity bias and personalized affinity effectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出ThinkRL-Edit，一种以视觉推理为中心的强化学习框架，通过解耦推理与生成、引入链式思维采样、无偏偏好分组及二元检查表奖励机制，显著提升指令驱动图像编辑中复杂推理任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有统一多模态生成模型在指令驱动图像编辑中视觉推理能力有限，尤其在推理密集型编辑任务上表现不佳；同时，传统强化学习方法面临推理探索受限、奖励融合有偏、VLM奖励不稳定三大挑战。

Method: 提出ThinkRL-Edit框架：1）解耦视觉推理与图像合成；2）在在线采样前引入含规划与反思阶段的链式思维（CoT）推理采样，扩展语义假设探索；3）采用跨多维奖励的无偏链偏好分组策略替代加权融合；4）用二元检查表替代区间式VLM评分，提升奖励精度、降低方差并增强可解释性。

Result: 在推理密集型图像编辑任务上显著优于先前方法，生成结果更忠实于指令、视觉更连贯、语义更扎实。

Conclusion: 解耦推理与生成、结构化推理过程（如CoT）、改进奖励设计（无偏分组+二元检查表）是提升多模态生成模型视觉推理能力的有效路径，为指令驱动编辑提供了新范式。

Abstract: Instruction-driven image editing with unified multimodal generative models has advanced rapidly, yet their underlying visual reasoning remains limited, leading to suboptimal performance on reasoning-centric edits. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been investigated for improving the quality of image editing, but it faces three key challenges: (1) limited reasoning exploration confined to denoising stochasticity, (2) biased reward fusion, and (3) unstable VLM-based instruction rewards. In this work, we propose ThinkRL-Edit, a reasoning-centric RL framework that decouples visual reasoning from image synthesis and expands reasoning exploration beyond denoising. To the end, we introduce Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-based reasoning sampling with planning and reflection stages prior to generation in online sampling, compelling the model to explore multiple semantic hypotheses and validate their plausibility before committing to a visual outcome. To avoid the failures of weighted aggregation, we propose an unbiased chain preference grouping strategy across multiple reward dimensions. Moreover, we replace interval-based VLM scores with a binary checklist, yielding more precise, lower-variance, and interpretable rewards for complex reasoning. Experiments show our method significantly outperforms prior work on reasoning-centric image editing, producing instruction-faithful, visually coherent, and semantically grounded edits.

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了文本到图像（T2I）强化学习后训练中的奖励作弊问题，发现现有奖励模型易导致生成含伪影的低质图像；为此提出一种轻量、自适应的伪影奖励模型，作为现有奖励的正则化器，显著提升图像真实感并缓解奖励作弊。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励函数是人类判断的不完美代理，导致模型出现奖励作弊——生成高奖励分但低质量或不真实的图像。

Method: 系统分析多种奖励（审美/偏好类、图文一致性类）单独及组合下的奖励作弊现象；识别共性失败模式（伪影图像）；构建基于小规模标注数据集的轻量自适应伪影奖励模型，并将其作为正则器嵌入RL流程。

Result: 在多个T2I RL设置中，引入伪影奖励显著提升了图像视觉真实感，有效降低了奖励作弊现象。

Conclusion: 轻量级奖励增强（如伪影奖励）可作为可靠的安全机制，弥补主流奖励模型缺陷，提升T2I模型的鲁棒性与生成质量。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a standard approach for post-training large language models and, more recently, for improving image generation models, which uses reward functions to enhance generation quality and human preference alignment. However, existing reward designs are often imperfect proxies for true human judgment, making models prone to reward hacking--producing unrealistic or low-quality images that nevertheless achieve high reward scores. In this work, we systematically analyze reward hacking behaviors in text-to-image (T2I) RL post-training. We investigate how both aesthetic/human preference rewards and prompt-image consistency rewards individually contribute to reward hacking and further show that ensembling multiple rewards can only partially mitigate this issue. Across diverse reward models, we identify a common failure mode: the generation of artifact-prone images. To address this, we propose a lightweight and adaptive artifact reward model, trained on a small curated dataset of artifact-free and artifact-containing samples. This model can be integrated into existing RL pipelines as an effective regularizer for commonly used reward models. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating our artifact reward significantly improves visual realism and reduces reward hacking across multiple T2I RL setups, demonstrating the effectiveness of lightweight reward augment serving as a safeguard against reward hacking.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种不确定性引导的遥感图像指代分割框架，通过像素级指代不确定性图动态调控语言-视觉融合与局部细化，提升复杂场景下的分割鲁棒性与几何精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法采用全局统一的跨模态融合与细化策略，在视觉清晰区域引入不必要的语言干扰，在混淆区域又缺乏足够消歧能力，而遥感图像中存在尺度变化大、相似干扰物密集、边界复杂等问题，导致跨模态对齐具有显著的空间非均匀性。

Method: 提出不确定性引导框架，包含：1）可插拔的指代不确定性评分器（RUS），通过在线误差一致性监督学习生成像素级不确定性图；2）不确定性门控融合（UGF），根据不确定性动态调节语言注入强度；3）不确定性驱动的局部细化（UDLR），利用不确定性软掩码聚焦于易错边界与细节区域。

Result: 在多个遥感指代分割基准上验证了方法有效性，作为即插即用模块显著提升了模型在复杂场景下的鲁棒性与几何保真度，且无需修改骨干网络结构。

Conclusion: 空间非均匀性是制约指代分割性能的关键因素，显式建模并利用像素级指代不确定性可实现自适应、精细化的跨模态协同，为遥感图像理解提供新范式。

Abstract: Referring remote sensing image segmentation aims to localize specific targets described by natural language within complex overhead imagery. However, due to extreme scale variations, dense similar distractors, and intricate boundary structures, the reliability of cross-modal alignment exhibits significant \textbf{spatial non-uniformity}. Existing methods typically employ uniform fusion and refinement strategies across the entire image, which often introduces unnecessary linguistic perturbations in visually clear regions while failing to provide sufficient disambiguation in confused areas. To address this, we propose an \textbf{uncertainty-guided framework} that explicitly leverages a pixel-wise \textbf{referring uncertainty map} as a spatial prior to orchestrate adaptive inference. Specifically, we introduce a plug-and-play \textbf{Referring Uncertainty Scorer (RUS)}, which is trained via an online error-consistency supervision strategy to interpretably predict the spatial distribution of referential ambiguity. Building on this prior, we design two plug-and-play modules: 1) \textbf{Uncertainty-Gated Fusion (UGF)}, which dynamically modulates language injection strength to enhance constraints in high-uncertainty regions while suppressing noise in low-uncertainty ones; and 2) \textbf{Uncertainty-Driven Local Refinement (UDLR)}, which utilizes uncertainty-derived soft masks to focus refinement on error-prone boundaries and fine details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method functions as a unified, plug-and-play solution that significantly improves robustness and geometric fidelity in complex remote sensing scenes without altering the backbone architecture.

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了单目3D目标检测中深度估计主干网络与特征工程的影响，发现深度主干选择（如NeWCRFs）和几何保真度对性能影响远大于语义等辅助特征的引入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目3D检测因缺乏精确深度信息而精度受限，需厘清深度估计质量与下游检测性能之间的关系及何种因素起主导作用。

Method: 在统一伪LiDAR生成与PointRCNN检测框架下，对比NeWCRFs与Depth Anything V2的深度估计效果；引入灰度强度与实例分割置信度作为点云增强特征，并开展距离相关的深度误差诊断。

Result: NeWCRFs在KITTI Moderate split上达到10.50% AP₃D（IoU=0.7）；语义特征仅带来微弱提升，掩码采样甚至损害性能；深度精度与距离强相关，且粗略深度正确性不能保证严格3D IoU。

Conclusion: 在即插即用LiDAR检测器前提下，深度主干网络的选择和生成点云的几何保真度是决定单目3D检测性能的最关键因素，远超附加外观或语义特征的作用。

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection offers a low-cost alternative to LiDAR, yet remains less accurate due to the difficulty of estimating metric depth from a single image. We systematically evaluate how depth backbones and feature engineering affect a monocular Pseudo-LiDAR pipeline on the KITTI validation split. Specifically, we compare NeWCRFs (supervised metric depth) against Depth Anything V2 Metric-Outdoor (Base) under an identical pseudo-LiDAR generation and PointRCNN detection protocol. NeWCRFs yields stronger downstream 3D detection, achieving 10.50\% AP$_{3D}$ at IoU$=0.7$ on the Moderate split using grayscale intensity (Exp~2). We further test point-cloud augmentations using appearance cues (grayscale intensity) and semantic cues (instance segmentation confidence). Contrary to the expectation that semantics would substantially close the gap, these features provide only marginal gains, and mask-based sampling can degrade performance by removing contextual geometry. Finally, we report a depth-accuracy-versus-distance diagnostic using ground-truth 2D boxes (including Ped/Cyc), highlighting that coarse depth correctness does not fully predict strict 3D IoU. Overall, under an off-the-shelf LiDAR detector, depth-backbone choice and geometric fidelity dominate performance, outweighing secondary feature injection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多关注语言先验或高层统计偏差，却忽视了视觉编码过程内部的复杂性；作者发现视觉统计偏差（源于视觉编码器在弱结构监督下的Bag-of-Patches行为）是导致物体幻觉的重要因素。

Method: 提出训练无关的Structure-Disrupted Contrastive Decoding（SDCD），通过生成结构被破坏（如patch打乱）的视觉输入，进行对比解码，惩罚在该结构缺失视图下仍保持高置信度的token，从而抑制纹理驱动偏差。

Result: SDCD在多个基准上显著缓解了物体幻觉，并提升了LVLMs的整体多模态能力。

Conclusion: 视觉编码器对局部纹理的过度依赖是物体幻觉的关键成因之一，而通过结构感知的推理校准（如SDCD）可有效缓解该问题，无需额外训练。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate significant progress in multimodal understanding and reasoning, yet object hallucination remains a critical challenge. While existing research focuses on mitigating language priors or high-level statistical biases, they often overlook the internal complexities of the visual encoding process. We identify that visual statistical bias, arising from the inherent Bag-of-Patches behavior of Vision Encoders under weak structural supervision, acts as a contributing factor of object hallucinations. Under this bias, models prioritize local texture features within individual patches over holistic geometric structures. This tendency may induce spurious visual confidence and result in hallucinations. To address this, we introduce a training-free algorithm called Structure-Disrupted Contrastive Decoding (SDCD), which performs contrastive calibration of the output distribution by introducing a shuffled structure-disrupted view. By penalizing tokens that maintain high confidence under this structure-less view, SDCD effectively suppresses the texture-driven bias. Experimental results demonstrate that SDCD significantly mitigates hallucinations across multiple benchmarks and enhances the overall multimodal capabilities of LVLMs.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation on point clouds is critical for 3D scene understanding. However, sparse and irregular point distributions provide limited appearance evidence, making geometry-only features insufficient to distinguish objects with similar shapes but distinct appearances (e.g., color, texture, material). We propose Gaussian-to-Point (G2P), which transfers appearance-aware attributes from 3D Gaussian Splatting to point clouds for more discriminative and appearance-consistent segmentation. Our G2P address the misalignment between optimized Gaussians and original point geometry by establishing point-wise correspondences. By leveraging Gaussian opacity attributes, we resolve the geometric ambiguity that limits existing models. Additionally, Gaussian scale attributes enable precise boundary localization in complex 3D scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance on standard benchmarks and shows significant improvements on geometrically challenging classes, all without any 2D or language supervision.

*Sarim Chaudhry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种语义信念状态世界模型（SBWM），将人体运动预测重新定义为在人体流形上的潜在动力学仿真，而非直接回归未来姿态，从而提升长时程预测的稳定性与可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将运动预测视为序列回归问题，存在累积漂移、均值姿态坍缩和不确定性校准差等问题，且缺乏对运动潜在因果机制的显式建模。

Method: SBWM构建一个递归概率信念状态，其演化独立于姿态重建，并显式对齐SMPL-X解剖参数化，形成结构化信息瓶颈；采用受基于信念状态的世界模型启发的随机潜在转移与rollout为中心的训练策略。

Result: 实现了连贯的长时程运动rollout，在保持竞争力的预测精度同时显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: 将人体纳入世界模型的状态空间（而非仅作为输出）从根本上改变了运动模拟与预测的方式，强调动力学建模与语义对齐的重要性。

Abstract: Human motion prediction has traditionally been framed as a sequence regression problem where models extrapolate future joint coordinates from observed pose histories. While effective over short horizons this approach does not separate observation reconstruction with dynamics modeling and offers no explicit representation of the latent causes governing motion. As a result, existing methods exhibit compounding drift, mean-pose collapse, and poorly calibrated uncertainty when rolled forward beyond the training regime. Here we propose a Semantic Belief-State World Model (SBWM) that reframes human motion prediction as latent dynamical simulation on the human body manifold. Rather than predicting poses directly, SBWM maintains a recurrent probabilistic belief state whose evolution is learned independently of pose reconstruction and explicitly aligned with the SMPL-X anatomical parameterization. This alignment imposes a structural information bottleneck that prevents the latent state from encoding static geometry or sensor noise, forcing it to capture motion dynamics, intent, and control-relevant structure. Inspired by belief-state world models developed for model-based reinforcement learning, SBWM adapts stochastic latent transitions and rollout-centric training to the domain of human motion. In contrast to RSSM-based, transformer, and diffusion approaches optimized for reconstruction fidelity, SBWM prioritizes stable forward simulation. We demonstrate coherent long-horizon rollouts, and competitive accuracy at substantially lower computational cost. These results suggest that treating the human body as part of the world models state space rather than its output fundamentally changes how motion is simulated, and predicted.

Conclusion: PCNet通过物理约束的跨模态协同优化，有效提升了热成像无人机图像超分辨率的保真度与实用性，为全天候监控提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Optics-guided thermal UAV image super-resolution has attracted significant research interest due to its potential in all-weather monitoring applications. However, existing methods typically compress optical features to match thermal feature dimensions for cross-modal alignment and fusion, which not only causes the loss of high-frequency information that is beneficial for thermal super-resolution, but also introduces physically inconsistent artifacts such as texture distortions and edge blurring by overlooking differences in the imaging physics between modalities. To address these challenges, we propose PCNet to achieve cross-resolution mutual enhancement between optical and thermal modalities, while physically constraining the optical guidance process via thermal conduction to enable robust thermal UAV image super-resolution. In particular, we design a Cross-Resolution Mutual Enhancement Module (CRME) to jointly optimize thermal image super-resolution and optical-to-thermal modality conversion, facilitating effective bidirectional feature interaction across resolutions while preserving high-frequency optical priors. Moreover, we propose a Physics-Driven Thermal Conduction Module (PDTM) that incorporates two-dimensional heat conduction into optical guidance, modeling spatially-varying heat conduction properties to prevent inconsistent artifacts. In addition, we introduce a temperature consistency loss that enforces regional distribution consistency and boundary gradient smoothness to ensure generated thermal images align with real-world thermal radiation principles. Extensive experiments on VGTSR2.0 and DroneVehicle datasets demonstrate that PCNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both reconstruction quality and downstream tasks including semantic segmentation and object detection.

### [30] [CloudMatch: Weak-to-Strong Consistency Learning for Semi-Supervised Cloud Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03528)
*Jiayi Zhao,Changlu Chen,Jingsheng Li,Tianxiang Xue,Kun Zhan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CloudMatch is a semi-supervised cloud detection framework using view-consistency learning and scene-mixing augmentations (inter- and intra-scene) to better capture cloud structural diversity and contextual variability, improving pseudolabeling and generalization with unlabeled remote sensing data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High cost of pixel-level annotation for cloud detection motivates semi-supervised learning; cloud patterns show structural diversity and contextual variability across and within scenes, which existing methods fail to fully exploit.

Method: CloudMatch employs view-consistency learning on three augmented views per unlabeled image: one weakly augmented, and two strongly augmented—inter-scene mixed (for contextual variety) and intra-scene mixed (for semantic coherence)—to guide pseudolabel generation.

Result: CloudMatch achieves strong performance in semi-supervised cloud detection, demonstrating efficient use of unlabeled data and improved generalization over prior methods.

Conclusion: Enforcing prediction consistency across diversely scene-mixed views effectively captures cloud pattern complexity, making CloudMatch a robust and scalable solution for semi-supervised cloud detection.

Abstract: Due to the high cost of annotating accurate pixel-level labels, semi-supervised learning has emerged as a promising approach for cloud detection. In this paper, we propose CloudMatch, a semi-supervised framework that effectively leverages unlabeled remote sensing imagery through view-consistency learning combined with scene-mixing augmentations. An observation behind CloudMatch is that cloud patterns exhibit structural diversity and contextual variability across different scenes and within the same scene category. Our key insight is that enforcing prediction consistency across diversely augmented views, incorporating both inter-scene and intra-scene mixing, enables the model to capture the structural diversity and contextual richness of cloud patterns. Specifically, CloudMatch generates one weakly augmented view along with two complementary strongly augmented views for each unlabeled image: one integrates inter-scene patches to simulate contextual variety, while the other employs intra-scene mixing to preserve semantic coherence. This approach guides pseudolabel generation and enhances generalization. Extensive experiments show that CloudMatch achieves good performance, demonstrating its capability to utilize unlabeled data efficiently and advance semi-supervised cloud detection.

TL;DR: 本文提出EASLT框架，通过情感感知融合模块将面部表情作为语义锚点，显著提升无词表SLT性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无词表手语翻译方法忽视面部表情（非手动信号）的语义关键性，导致相同手势对应不同概念时出现歧义。

Method: 提出EASLT框架，包含专用情感编码器捕获连续情感动态，并设计情感感知融合（EAF）模块，根据情感上下文自适应校准时空手语特征。

Result: 在PHOENIX14T和CSL-Daily数据集上，BLEU-4分别达26.15和22.80，BLEURT达61.0和57.8，为当前最优无词表方法之一；消融实验验证情感建模有效解耦情感语义与手势动态。

Conclusion: 将面部情感显式建模为语义锚点，能显著提升手语翻译的准确性与鲁棒性，尤其在消除手势歧义方面效果突出。

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a complex cross-modal task requiring the integration of Manual Signals (MS) and Non-Manual Signals (NMS). While recent gloss-free SLT methods have made strides in translating manual gestures, they frequently overlook the semantic criticality of facial expressions, resulting in ambiguity when distinct concepts share identical manual articulations. To address this, we present **EASLT** (**E**motion-**A**ware **S**ign **L**anguage **T**ranslation), a framework that treats facial affect not as auxiliary information, but as a robust semantic anchor. Unlike methods that relegate facial expressions to a secondary role, EASLT incorporates a dedicated emotional encoder to capture continuous affective dynamics. These representations are integrated via a novel *Emotion-Aware Fusion* (EAF) module, which adaptively recalibrates spatio-temporal sign features based on affective context to resolve semantic ambiguities. Extensive evaluations on the PHOENIX14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks demonstrate that EASLT establishes advanced performance among gloss-free methods, achieving BLEU-4 scores of 26.15 and 22.80, and BLEURT scores of 61.0 and 57.8, respectively. Ablation studies confirm that explicitly modeling emotion effectively decouples affective semantics from manual dynamics, significantly enhancing translation fidelity.

Motivation: 跨模态定位中，物体在文本和点云中频繁重复出现，空间关系是最具区分性的线索。

Method: 提出SpatiaLoc框架：粗阶段使用Bezier增强的对象空间编码器（BEOSE）建模实例级空间关系（基于二次贝塞尔曲线），并用频域感知编码器（FAE）在全局层面生成空间表征；细阶段采用不确定性感知高斯精确定位器（UGFL），将2D位置预测建模为高斯分布并设计不确定性感知损失函数。

Result: 在KITTI360Pose数据集上，SpatiaLoc显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 强调空间关系建模（尤其结合几何曲线与频域表征）及不确定性感知的精确定位，是提升文本-点云跨模态定位性能的有效途径。

Abstract: Cross-modal localization using text and point clouds enables robots to localize themselves via natural language descriptions, with applications in autonomous navigation and interaction between humans and robots. In this task, objects often recur across text and point clouds, making spatial relationships the most discriminative cues for localization. Given this characteristic, we present SpatiaLoc, a framework utilizing a coarse-to-fine strategy that emphasizes spatial relationships at both the instance and global levels. In the coarse stage, we introduce a Bezier Enhanced Object Spatial Encoder (BEOSE) that models spatial relationships at the instance level using quadratic Bezier curves. Additionally, a Frequency Aware Encoder (FAE) generates spatial representations in the frequency domain at the global level. In the fine stage, an Uncertainty Aware Gaussian Fine Localizer (UGFL) regresses 2D positions by modeling predictions as Gaussian distributions with a loss function aware of uncertainty. Extensive experiments on KITTI360Pose demonstrate that SpatiaLoc significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于掩码的预训练模型微调策略（MPFT），通过纹理感知掩码（TAM）机制增强CLIP-ViT对AI生成图像的泛化检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式模型快速发展导致AI图像质量提升，带来虚假信息与信任危机；现有基于冻结CLIP的方法泛化性有限，未能充分挖掘图像编码器潜力。

Method: 深入分析冻结CLIP-ViT特征空间特性，发现其能聚类真实图像但无法区分真假；据此提出MPFT策略，引入TAM机制在微调中遮蔽含生成模型特有纹理的区域，迫使模型关注真实图像分布偏差。

Conclusion: MPFT策略有效提升了冻结CLIP模型在未见生成模型上的泛化检测性能，验证了聚焦分布偏差比依赖纹理线索更鲁棒。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has significantly enhanced the quality of AI-generated images, raising concerns about misinformation and the erosion of public trust. Detecting AI-generated images has thus become a critical challenge, particularly in terms of generalizing to unseen generative models. Existing methods using frozen pre-trained CLIP models show promise in generalization but treat the image encoder as a basic feature extractor, failing to fully exploit its potential. In this paper, we perform an in-depth analysis of the frozen CLIP image encoder (CLIP-ViT), revealing that it effectively clusters real images in a high-level, abstract feature space. However, it does not truly possess the ability to distinguish between real and AI-generated images. Based on this analysis, we propose a Masking-based Pre-trained model Fine-Tuning (MPFT) strategy, which introduces a Texture-Aware Masking (TAM) mechanism to mask textured areas containing generative model-specific patterns during fine-tuning. This approach compels CLIP-ViT to attend to the "distributional deviations"from authentic images for AI-generated image detection, thereby achieving enhanced generalization performance. Extensive experiments on the GenImage and UniversalFakeDetect datasets demonstrate that our method, fine-tuned with only a minimal number of images, significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving up to 98.2% and 94.6% average accuracy on the two datasets, respectively.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究空间理解能力究竟源于视觉编码器还是语言模型自身的推理主干，从而推动脱离视觉输入的空间智能评估。

Method: 构建SiT-Bench基准，将单/多视角场景转化为高保真、坐标感知的文本描述，涵盖5大类17个子任务，纯文本形式测试LLM的空间推理能力。

Result: SOTA LLM在局部语义任务上表现良好，但在全局空间一致性上存在明显‘空间鸿沟’；显式空间推理可显著提升性能。

Conclusion: LLM具备潜在的世界建模能力；SiT-Bench为构建空间具身化LLM和未来VLM提供了基础数据与评估范式。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Spatial Intelligence (SI) have predominantly relied on Vision-Language Models (VLMs), yet a critical question remains: does spatial understanding originate from visual encoders or the fundamental reasoning backbone? Inspired by this question, we introduce SiT-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the SI performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) without pixel-level input, comprises over 3,800 expert-annotated items across five primary categories and 17 subtasks, ranging from egocentric navigation and perspective transformation to fine-grained robotic manipulation. By converting single/multi-view scenes into high-fidelity, coordinate-aware textual descriptions, we challenge LLMs to perform symbolic textual reasoning rather than visual pattern matching. Evaluation results of state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs reveals that while models achieve proficiency in localized semantic tasks, a significant "spatial gap" remains in global consistency. Notably, we find that explicit spatial reasoning significantly boosts performance, suggesting that LLMs possess latent world-modeling potential. Our proposed dataset SiT-Bench serves as a foundational resource to foster the development of spatially-grounded LLM backbones for future VLMs and embodied agents. Our code and benchmark will be released at https://github.com/binisalegend/SiT-Bench .

Conclusion: 引入环境鲁棒FSS设定与ER-FSS基准，并通过AAD方法有效提升了模型在复杂动态真实环境中的分割鲁棒性，推动FSS向实用化迈进。

Abstract: Few-shot segmentation (FSS) aims to rapidly learn novel class concepts from limited examples to segment specific targets in unseen images, and has been widely applied in areas such as medical diagnosis and industrial inspection. However, existing studies largely overlook the complex environmental factors encountered in real world scenarios-such as illumination, background, and camera viewpoint-which can substantially increase the difficulty of test images. As a result, models trained under laboratory conditions often fall short of practical deployment requirements. To bridge this gap, in this paper, an environment-robust FSS setting is introduced that explicitly incorporates challenging test cases arising from complex environments-such as motion blur, small objects, and camouflaged targets-to enhance model's robustness under realistic, dynamic conditions. An environment robust FSS benchmark (ER-FSS) is established, covering eight datasets across multiple real world scenarios. In addition, an Adaptive Attention Distillation (AAD) method is proposed, which repeatedly contrasts and distills key shared semantics between known (support) and unknown (query) images to derive class-specific attention for novel categories. This strengthens the model's ability to focus on the correct targets in complex environments, thereby improving environmental robustness. Comparative experiments show that AAD improves mIoU by 3.3% - 8.5% across all datasets and settings, demonstrating superior performance and strong generalization.

Abstract: Binarization is a popular first step towards text extraction in historical artifacts. Stone inscription images pose severe challenges for binarization due to poor contrast between etched characters and the stone background, non-uniform surface degradation, distracting artifacts, and highly variable text density and layouts. These conditions frequently cause existing binarization techniques to fail and struggle to isolate coherent character regions. Many approaches sub-divide the image into patches to improve text fragment resolution and improve binarization performance. With this in mind, we present a robust and adaptive patching strategy to binarize challenging Indic inscriptions. The patches from our approach are used to train an Attention U-Net for binarization. The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on subtle structural cues, while our dynamic sampling and patch selection method ensures that the model learns to overcome surface noise and layout irregularities. We also introduce a carefully annotated, pixel-precise dataset of Indic stone inscriptions at the character-fragment level. We demonstrate that our novel patching mechanism significantly boosts binarization performance across classical and deep learning baselines. Despite training only on single script Indic dataset, our model exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to other Indic and non-indic scripts, highlighting its robustness and script-agnostic generalization capabilities. By producing clean, structured representations of inscription content, our method lays the foundation for downstream tasks such as script identification, OCR, and historical text analysis.

Abstract: The existing object classification techniques based on descriptive features rely on object alignment to compute the similarity of objects for classification. This paper replaces the necessity of object alignment through sorting of feature. The object boundary is normalized and segmented into approximately convex segments and the segments are then sorted in descending order of their length. The segment length, number of extreme points in segments, area of segments, the base and the width of the segments - a bag of features - is used to measure the similarity between image boundaries. The proposed method is tested on datasets and acceptable results are observed.

Abstract: Accurate and high-resolution precipitation nowcasting from radar echo sequences is crucial for disaster mitigation and economic planning, yet it remains a significant challenge. Key difficulties include modeling complex multi-scale evolution, correcting inter-frame feature misalignment caused by displacement, and efficiently capturing long-range spatiotemporal context without sacrificing spatial fidelity. To address these issues, we present the Multi-scale Feature Communication Rectified Flow (RF) Network (MFC-RFNet), a generative framework that integrates multi-scale communication with guided feature fusion. To enhance multi-scale fusion while retaining fine detail, a Wavelet-Guided Skip Connection (WGSC) preserves high-frequency components, and a Feature Communication Module (FCM) promotes bidirectional cross-scale interaction. To correct inter-frame displacement, a Condition-Guided Spatial Transform Fusion (CGSTF) learns spatial transforms from conditioning echoes to align shallow features. The backbone adopts rectified flow training to learn near-linear probability-flow trajectories, enabling few-step sampling with stable fidelity. Additionally, lightweight Vision-RWKV (RWKV) blocks are placed at the encoder tail, the bottleneck, and the first decoder layer to capture long-range spatiotemporal dependencies at low spatial resolutions with moderate compute. Evaluations on four public datasets (SEVIR, MeteoNet, Shanghai, and CIKM) demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines, yielding clearer echo morphology at higher rain-rate thresholds and sustained skill at longer lead times. These results suggest that the proposed synergy of RF training with scale-aware communication, spatial alignment, and frequency-aware fusion presents an effective and robust approach for radar-based nowcasting.

Abstract: Automated crack segmentation is essential for scalable condition assessment of pavements and civil infrastructure, yet practical deployment is limited by scarce pixel-level labels and severe domain shift across sensors, illumination, textures, and annotation conventions. This paper presents CrackSegFlow, a controllable flow-matching synthesis framework that generates photorealistic crack images conditioned on binary masks while preserving strict mask-image alignment. The generator combines topology-preserving mask injection with boundary-gated modulation to maintain thin-structure continuity and suppress texture-driven false positives. A second class-conditional flow-matching model synthesizes crack masks with explicit control over crack coverage, enabling balanced, topology-diverse paired data without additional manual annotation. We further inject crack masks into crack-free backgrounds to diversify illumination and surface artifacts and reduce false positives caused by shadows, joints, and pavement markings. Experiments on five benchmarks spanning four asphalt datasets and the crack class of a concrete-domain dataset demonstrate consistent improvements under an established hybrid CNN--Transformer segmentation backbone and a fixed training protocol. With real plus synthesized pairs, in-domain performance improves on average by 5.37 mIoU and 5.13 F1, and target-guided cross-domain synthesis yields average gains of 13.12 mIoU and 14.82 F1 using only limited target mask statistics. Compared with diffusion-based semantic synthesis, CrackSegFlow provides substantially faster deterministic sampling and improves fidelity and mask-image alignment for thin-structure crack geometry. Finally, we release CSF-50K, a public dataset of 50,000 paired crack images and pixel-accurate masks for large-scale benchmarking of generalizable crack segmentation.

Conclusion: VideoMemory通过检索-更新机制有效解决了长时序叙事视频中实体一致性问题，支持高质量长篇视频生成。

Abstract: Maintaining consistent characters, props, and environments across multiple shots is a central challenge in narrative video generation. Existing models can produce high-quality short clips but often fail to preserve entity identity and appearance when scenes change or when entities reappear after long temporal gaps. We present VideoMemory, an entity-centric framework that integrates narrative planning with visual generation through a Dynamic Memory Bank. Given a structured script, a multi-agent system decomposes the narrative into shots, retrieves entity representations from memory, and synthesizes keyframes and videos conditioned on these retrieved states. The Dynamic Memory Bank stores explicit visual and semantic descriptors for characters, props, and backgrounds, and is updated after each shot to reflect story-driven changes while preserving identity. This retrieval-update mechanism enables consistent portrayal of entities across distant shots and supports coherent long-form generation. To evaluate this setting, we construct a 54-case multi-shot consistency benchmark covering character-, prop-, and background-persistent scenarios. Extensive experiments show that VideoMemory achieves strong entity-level coherence and high perceptual quality across diverse narrative sequences.

Abstract: Point cloud completion aims to recover complete 3D geometry from partial observations caused by limited viewpoints and occlusions. Existing learning-based works, including 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based, point-based, and Transformer-based methods, have achieved strong performance on synthetic benchmarks. However, due to the limitations of modality, scalability, and generative capacity, their generalization to novel objects and real-world scenarios remains challenging. In this paper, we propose MGPC, a generalizable multimodal point cloud completion framework that integrates point clouds, RGB images, and text within a unified architecture. MGPC introduces an innovative modality dropout strategy, a Transformer-based fusion module, and a novel progressive generator to improve robustness, scalability, and geometric modeling capability. We further develop an automatic data generation pipeline and construct MGPC-1M, a large-scale benchmark with over 1,000 categories and one million training pairs. Extensive experiments on MGPC-1M and in-the-wild data demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms prior baselines and exhibits strong generalization under real-world conditions.

Abstract: Current video generation models produce high-quality aesthetic videos but often struggle to learn representations of real-world physics dynamics, resulting in artifacts such as unnatural object collisions, inconsistent gravity, and temporal flickering. In this work, we propose PhysVideoGenerator, a proof-of-concept framework that explicitly embeds a learnable physics prior into the video generation process. We introduce a lightweight predictor network, PredictorP, which regresses high-level physical features extracted from a pre-trained Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA 2) directly from noisy diffusion latents. These predicted physics tokens are injected into the temporal attention layers of a DiT-based generator (Latte) via a dedicated cross-attention mechanism. Our primary contribution is demonstrating the technical feasibility of this joint training paradigm: we show that diffusion latents contain sufficient information to recover V-JEPA 2 physical representations, and that multi-task optimization remains stable over training. This report documents the architectural design, technical challenges, and validation of training stability, establishing a foundation for future large-scale evaluation of physics-aware generative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多依赖RGB外观或人体姿态估计，而本文旨在探索更轻量、有效的运动表征方式，无需检测手部、物体或交互区域。

Method: 使用CoTracker跟踪随机采样的图像点，获取其跨帧轨迹，并将轨迹与对应图像帧联合输入Transformer模型进行动作识别。

Result: 仅用初始帧及其点轨迹即可取得显著性能提升；集成2D点轨迹 consistently优于无运动信息的基线模型。

Conclusion: 2D点轨迹是一种轻量且高效的动作理解运动表征，在自我中心视频中具有重要潜力。

Abstract: We present a novel approach for egocentric action recognition that leverages 2D point tracks as an additional motion cue. While most existing methods rely on RGB appearance, human pose estimation, or their combination, our work demonstrates that tracking randomly sampled image points across video frames can substantially improve recognition accuracy. Unlike prior approaches, we do not detect hands, objects, or interaction regions. Instead, we employ CoTracker to follow a set of randomly initialized points through each video and use the resulting trajectories, together with the corresponding image frames, as input to a Transformer-based recognition model. Surprisingly, our method achieves notable gains even when only the initial frame and its associated point tracks are provided, without incorporating the full video sequence. Experimental results confirm that integrating 2D point tracks consistently enhances performance compared to the same model trained without motion information, highlighting their potential as a lightweight yet effective representation for egocentric action understanding.

TL;DR: 本文提出BREATH-VL框架，结合视觉语言模型（VLM）的语义理解能力与基于视觉的配准方法的几何精度，解决6自由度内窥镜相机定位中的数据稀缺、细粒度位姿回归难和时序计算延迟高等问题；为此构建了目前最大的真实气道内窥镜定位数据集BREATH，并引入轻量级上下文学习机制以提升VLM的时序建模能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLM在导航与定位中表现优异，但在6-DoF内窥镜定位中面临三大挑战：缺乏高质量、密集标注、面向定位的医学视觉-语言数据集；VLM细粒度位姿回归能力有限；时序特征提取计算开销大。本文旨在融合VLM的泛化性语义理解与传统配准方法的高精度几何对齐能力，实现更鲁棒、准确且高效的定位。

Method: 1）构建BREATH数据集——当前最大规模的真实人体气道内窥镜6-DoF定位数据集；2）提出BREATH-VL混合框架：联合VLM语义线索与视觉配准几何信息进行位姿估计；3）设计轻量级上下文学习机制，将运动历史编码为语言提示，实现高效时序推理。

Conclusion: 融合语义与几何信息的混合范式（BREATH-VL）是提升内窥镜6-DoF定位性能的有效路径；BREATH数据集和轻量时序提示机制为医疗VLM研究提供了重要基础与新思路。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently shown remarkable performance in navigation and localization tasks by leveraging large-scale pretraining for semantic understanding. However, applying VLMs to 6-DoF endoscopic camera localization presents several challenges: 1) the lack of large-scale, high-quality, densely annotated, and localization-oriented vision-language datasets in real-world medical settings; 2) limited capability for fine-grained pose regression; and 3) high computational latency when extracting temporal features from past frames. To address these issues, we first construct BREATH dataset, the largest in-vivo endoscopic localization dataset to date, collected in the complex human airway. Building on this dataset, we propose BREATH-VL, a hybrid framework that integrates semantic cues from VLMs with geometric information from vision-based registration methods for accurate 6-DoF pose estimation. Our motivation lies in the complementary strengths of both approaches: VLMs offer generalizable semantic understanding, while registration methods provide precise geometric alignment. To further enhance the VLM's ability to capture temporal context, we introduce a lightweight context-learning mechanism that encodes motion history as linguistic prompts, enabling efficient temporal reasoning without expensive video-level computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the vision-language module delivers robust semantic localization in challenging surgical scenes. Building on this, our BREATH-VL outperforms state-of-the-art vision-only localization methods in both accuracy and generalization, reducing translational error by 25.5% compared with the best-performing baseline, while achieving competitive computational latency.

Conclusion: 域适应能有效赋予仿真训练模型强健的真实世界性能，验证了数字孪生流水线作为大规模光学装配高效实用方案的可行性。

Abstract: Active Alignment (AA) is a key technology for the large-scale automated assembly of high-precision optical systems. Compared with labor-intensive per-model on-device calibration, a digital-twin pipeline built on optical simulation offers a substantial advantage in generating large-scale labeled data. However, complex imaging conditions induce a domain gap between simulation and real-world images, limiting the generalization of simulation-trained models. To address this, we propose augmenting a simulation baseline with minimal unlabeled real-world images captured at random misalignment positions, mitigating the gap from a domain adaptation perspective. We introduce Domain Adaptive Active Alignment (DA3), which utilizes an autoregressive domain transformation generator and an adversarial-based feature alignment strategy to distill real-world domain information via self-supervised learning. This enables the extraction of domain-invariant image degradation features to facilitate robust misalignment prediction. Experiments on two lens types reveal that DA3 improves accuracy by 46% over a purely simulation pipeline. Notably, it approaches the performance achieved with precisely labeled real-world data collected on 3 lens samples, while reducing on-device data collection time by 98.7%. The results demonstrate that domain adaptation effectively endows simulation-trained models with robust real-world performance, validating the digital-twin pipeline as a practical solution to significantly enhance the efficiency of large-scale optical assembly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有组合图像检索（CIR）方法因查询与目标模态异构、编码器分离，导致表征空间碎片化和后验对齐效果受限，根本性限制检索性能。

Method: 提出CSMCIR统一表征框架：1）多级思维链（MCoT）提示生成语义兼容的图文描述以建立模态对称；2）共享参数Q-Former的对称双塔架构确保一致跨模态编码；3）熵驱动的时序动态记忆库提供高质量负样本并保持模型状态一致性。

Conclusion: 表征空间对称性是提升CIR性能的关键，CSMCIR通过模态、架构与优化三重对称设计，有效弥合跨模态对齐鸿沟，为多模态检索提供新范式。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) enables users to search for target images using both a reference image and manipulation text, offering substantial advantages over single-modality retrieval systems. However, existing CIR methods suffer from representation space fragmentation: queries and targets comprise heterogeneous modalities and are processed by distinct encoders, forcing models to bridge misaligned representation spaces only through post-hoc alignment, which fundamentally limits retrieval performance. This architectural asymmetry manifests as three distinct, well-separated clusters in the feature space, directly demonstrating how heterogeneous modalities create fundamentally misaligned representation spaces from initialization. In this work, we propose CSMCIR, a unified representation framework that achieves efficient query-target alignment through three synergistic components. First, we introduce a Multi-level Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) prompting strategy that guides Multimodal Large Language Models to generate discriminative, semantically compatible captions for target images, establishing modal symmetry. Building upon this, we design a symmetric dual-tower architecture where both query and target sides utilize the identical shared-parameter Q-Former for cross-modal encoding, ensuring consistent feature representations and further reducing the alignment gap. Finally, this architectural symmetry enables an entropy-based, temporally dynamic Memory Bank strategy that provides high-quality negative samples while maintaining consistency with the evolving model state. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our CSMCIR achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior training efficiency. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each proposed component.

Conclusion: MATANet有效融合环境上下文与生物分类学先验知识，显著提升海洋物种细粒度识别鲁棒性与可解释性。

Abstract: Fine-grained classification of marine animals supports ecology, biodiversity and habitat conservation, and evidence-based policy-making. However, existing methods often overlook contextual interactions from the surrounding environment and insufficiently incorporate the hierarchical structure of marine biological taxonomy. To address these challenges, we propose MATANet (Multi-context Attention and Taxonomy-Aware Network), a novel model designed for fine-grained marine species classification. MATANet mimics expert strategies by using taxonomy and environmental context to interpret ambiguous features of underwater animals. It consists of two key components: a Multi-Context Environmental Attention Module (MCEAM), which learns relationships between regions of interest (ROIs) and their surrounding environments, and a Hierarchical Separation-Induced Learning Module (HSLM), which encodes taxonomic hierarchy into the feature space. MATANet combines instance and environmental features with taxonomic structure to enhance fine-grained classification. Experiments on the FathomNet2025, FAIR1M, and LifeCLEF2015-Fish datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: RadDiff与RadDiffBench共同构成了首个系统性挖掘放射学数据中有意义差异的方法与基准基础。

Abstract: Understanding how two radiology image sets differ is critical for generating clinical insights and for interpreting medical AI systems. We introduce RadDiff, a multimodal agentic system that performs radiologist-style comparative reasoning to describe clinically meaningful differences between paired radiology studies. RadDiff builds on a proposer-ranker framework from VisDiff, and incorporates four innovations inspired by real diagnostic workflows: (1) medical knowledge injection through domain-adapted vision-language models; (2) multimodal reasoning that integrates images with their clinical reports; (3) iterative hypothesis refinement across multiple reasoning rounds; and (4) targeted visual search that localizes and zooms in on salient regions to capture subtle findings. To evaluate RadDiff, we construct RadDiffBench, a challenging benchmark comprising 57 expert-validated radiology study pairs with ground-truth difference descriptions. On RadDiffBench, RadDiff achieves 47% accuracy, and 50% accuracy when guided by ground-truth reports, significantly outperforming the general-domain VisDiff baseline. We further demonstrate RadDiff's versatility across diverse clinical tasks, including COVID-19 phenotype comparison, racial subgroup analysis, and discovery of survival-related imaging features. Together, RadDiff and RadDiffBench provide the first method-and-benchmark foundation for systematically uncovering meaningful differences in radiological data.

Motivation: RGB图像在伪装目标检测中因颜色和纹理线索模糊而受限；高光谱图像虽具潜力，但缺乏专用大规模基准严重阻碍了HCOD发展。

Method: 构建包含350张高分辨率高光谱图像的HyperCOD基准；提出HSC-SAM模型，将高光谱图像解耦为空间图（输入SAM图像编码器）和光谱显著性图（作为自适应提示），以弥合模态差异。

Conclusion: HyperCOD数据集与HSC-SAM基线为高光谱伪装目标检测这一新兴方向提供了坚实基础，有望推动后续研究。

Abstract: RGB-based camouflaged object detection struggles in real-world scenarios where color and texture cues are ambiguous. While hyperspectral image offers a powerful alternative by capturing fine-grained spectral signatures, progress in hyperspectral camouflaged object detection (HCOD) has been critically hampered by the absence of a dedicated, large-scale benchmark. To spur innovation, we introduce HyperCOD, the first challenging benchmark for HCOD. Comprising 350 high-resolution hyperspectral images, It features complex real-world scenarios with minimal objects, intricate shapes, severe occlusions, and dynamic lighting to challenge current models. The advent of foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) presents a compelling opportunity. To adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for HCOD, we propose HyperSpectral Camouflage-aware SAM (HSC-SAM). HSC-SAM ingeniously reformulates the hyperspectral image by decoupling it into a spatial map fed to SAM's image encoder and a spectral saliency map that serves as an adaptive prompt. This translation effectively bridges the modality gap. Extensive experiments show that HSC-SAM sets a new state-of-the-art on HyperCOD and generalizes robustly to other public HSI datasets. The HyperCOD dataset and our HSC-SAM baseline provide a robust foundation to foster future research in this emerging area.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于端到端像素级修复的文本引导图像编辑方法在需要精确局部控制和复杂多对象空间推理的组合编辑任务中表现不佳，受限于规划与执行隐式耦合、缺乏对象级控制粒度以及依赖非结构化的像素中心建模。

Method: 提出I2E框架：1）使用Decomposer将非结构化图像分解为离散、可操作的对象层；2）引入物理感知的Vision-Language-Action Agent，通过思维链（Chain-of-Thought）推理将复杂指令解析为一系列原子动作；3）构建专用于多实例空间推理与高精度编辑的基准I2E-Bench。

Conclusion: I2E通过结构化环境中的可操作交互范式，有效克服了传统像素级编辑范式的根本局限，为复杂图像编辑任务提供了更可控、更鲁棒的新路径。

Abstract: Existing text-guided image editing methods primarily rely on end-to-end pixel-level inpainting paradigm. Despite its success in simple scenarios, this paradigm still significantly struggles with compositional editing tasks that require precise local control and complex multi-object spatial reasoning. This paradigm is severely limited by 1) the implicit coupling of planning and execution, 2) the lack of object-level control granularity, and 3) the reliance on unstructured, pixel-centric modeling. To address these limitations, we propose I2E, a novel "Decompose-then-Action" paradigm that revisits image editing as an actionable interaction process within a structured environment. I2E utilizes a Decomposer to transform unstructured images into discrete, manipulable object layers and then introduces a physics-aware Vision-Language-Action Agent to parse complex instructions into a series of atomic actions via Chain-of-Thought reasoning. Further, we also construct I2E-Bench, a benchmark designed for multi-instance spatial reasoning and high-precision editing. Experimental results on I2E-Bench and multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that I2E significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in handling complex compositional instructions, maintaining physical plausibility, and ensuring multi-turn editing stability.

Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的VideoLLM后训练范式虽提升了整体视觉语义理解能力，但缺乏对时间连贯性和帧间相关性的显式监督，难以建模精细动态与视觉因果关系。

Method: 提出掩码视频预测（MVP）目标，要求模型从多个干扰项中重建被遮蔽的连续视频片段；设计可扩展的数据合成流程生成MVP样本；采用分组相对策略优化（GRPO）配合细粒度奖励函数进行训练。

Result: 在多项视频推理评测中，MVP显著提升了模型的时间推理与因果理解能力，验证了其对视频上下文和时序特性的有效增强。

Conclusion: MVP是一种有效的、面向时间结构建模的VideoLLM后训练范式，为提升视频大模型的动态理解和因果推理能力提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning based post-training paradigms for Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have achieved significant success by optimizing for visual-semantic tasks such as captioning or VideoQA. However, while these approaches effectively enhance perception abilities, they primarily target holistic content understanding, often lacking explicit supervision for intrinsic temporal coherence and inter-frame correlations. This tendency limits the models' ability to capture intricate dynamics and fine-grained visual causality. To explicitly bridge this gap, we propose a novel post-training objective: Masked Video Prediction (MVP). By requiring the model to reconstruct a masked continuous segment from a set of challenging distractors, MVP forces the model to attend to the sequential logic and temporal context of events. To support scalable training, we introduce a scalable data synthesis pipeline capable of transforming arbitrary video corpora into MVP training samples, and further employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a fine-grained reward function to enhance the model's understanding of video context and temporal properties. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that MVP enhances video reasoning capabilities by directly reinforcing temporal reasoning and causal understanding.

Training these AI models requires a large amount of training data that is costly to acquire and annotate, especially in high-variance, low-volume manufacturing environments. A popular approach to reduce the need for real data is the use of synthetic data that is generated by leveraging computer-aided design (CAD) models available in the industry. However, in the agricultural industry these models are not readily available, increasing the difficulty in leveraging synthetic data. In this paper, we present different techniques for substituting CAD files to create synthetic datasets. We measure their relative performance when used to train an AI object detection model to separate stones and potatoes in a bin picking environment. We demonstrate that using highly representative 3D models acquired by scanning or using image-to-3D approaches can be used to generate synthetic data for training object detection models. Finetuning on a small real dataset can significantly improve the performance of the models and even get similar performance when less representative models are used.

### [53] [From Brute Force to Semantic Insight: Performance-Guided Data Transformation Design with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03808)
*Usha Shrestha,Dmitry Ignatov,Radu Timofte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种性能感知的闭环代码增强方法NNGPT，使大语言模型能基于实证性能反馈自主优化数据增强策略，无需强化学习或符号奖励，显著减少搜索开销并提升任务对齐性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在代码合成中受限于数据感知增强方法，多依赖启发式设计或暴力搜索，缺乏高效、自动化的性能驱动增强机制。

Method: 在NNGPT框架下，基于6000+个仅以下游模型准确率标注的PyTorch增强函数，采用LoRA微调LLM；使用成对性能排序（优-劣）作为监督信号，通过直接提示（非CoT）实现经验反馈对齐。

Result: 相比暴力搜索，候选评估量减少达600倍，同时保持有竞争力的峰值准确率；消融表明直接提示优于Chain-of-Thought，模型能内化语义性能线索而非记忆语法。

Conclusion: LLM可通过纯经验性、非文本的反馈闭环实现任务级推理，无需显式符号奖励，为数据增强与代码智能体设计提供了新范式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved notable performance in code synthesis; however, data-aware augmentation remains a limiting factor, handled via heuristic design or brute-force approaches. We introduce a performance-aware, closed-loop solution in the NNGPT ecosystem of projects that enables LLMs to autonomously engineer optimal transformations by internalizing empirical performance cues. We fine-tune LLMs with Low-Rank Adaptation on a novel repository of more than 6,000 empirically evaluated PyTorch augmentation functions, each annotated solely by downstream model accuracy. Training uses pairwise performance ordering (better-worse transformations), enabling alignment through empirical feedback without reinforcement learning, reward models, or symbolic objectives. This reduces the need for exhaustive search, achieving up to 600x times fewer evaluated candidates than brute-force discovery while maintaining competitive peak accuracy and shifting generation from random synthesis to task-aligned design. Ablation studies show that structured Chain-of-Thought prompting introduces syntactic noise and degrades performance, whereas direct prompting ensures stable optimization in performance-critical code tasks. Qualitative and quantitative analyses demonstrate that the model internalizes semantic performance cues rather than memorizing syntax. These results show that LLMs can exhibit task-level reasoning through non-textual feedback loops, bypassing explicit symbolic rewards.

Abstract: Developing foundation models in medical imaging requires continuous monitoring of downstream performance. Researchers are burdened with tracking numerous experiments, design choices, and their effects on performance, often relying on ad-hoc, manual workflows that are inherently slow and error-prone. We introduce EvalBlocks, a modular, plug-and-play framework for efficient evaluation of foundation models during development. Built on Snakemake, EvalBlocks supports seamless integration of new datasets, foundation models, aggregation methods, and evaluation strategies. All experiments and results are tracked centrally and are reproducible with a single command, while efficient caching and parallel execution enable scalable use on shared compute infrastructure. Demonstrated on five state-of-the-art foundation models and three medical imaging classification tasks, EvalBlocks streamlines model evaluation, enabling researchers to iterate faster and focus on model innovation rather than evaluation logistics. The framework is released as open source software at https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/eval-blocks.

*Wei Long,Haifeng Wu,Shiyin Jiang,Jinhua Zhang,Xinchun Ji,Shuhang Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IDESplat提出了一种迭代深度概率增强方法，通过多级级联warp操作和乘性融合的epipolar注意力图，提升深度估计精度，从而更准确预测3D高斯椭球中心，在多个数据集上实现SOTA性能与强泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用3D高斯泼溅方法依赖单次warp估计深度，难以充分利用跨视角几何线索，导致深度图不稳定、粗糙，进而影响高斯均值（即球心）预测精度。

Method: 提出IDESplat：1）设计深度概率增强单元（DPBU），级联多次warp生成epipolar注意力图并乘性融合以抑制单warp不稳定性；2）堆叠多个DPBU构建迭代深度估计流程，逐步筛选高置信度深度候选，持续优化深度图。

Result: 在RealEstate10K、ACID、DL3DV及跨域DTU上显著优于DepthSplat：RE10K上PSNR提升0.33 dB，参数仅10.7%、内存仅70%；DTU跨域实验PSNR提升2.95 dB；兼具实时效率与强泛化性。

Conclusion: 迭代式深度概率增强机制能有效提升深度估计鲁棒性与精度，从而显著改善通用3D高斯泼溅中高斯均值预测质量，是提升场景重建性能与泛化能力的有效范式。

Abstract: Generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting aims to directly predict Gaussian parameters using a feed-forward network for scene reconstruction. Among these parameters, Gaussian means are particularly difficult to predict, so depth is usually estimated first and then unprojected to obtain the Gaussian sphere centers. Existing methods typically rely solely on a single warp to estimate depth probability, which hinders their ability to fully leverage cross-view geometric cues, resulting in unstable and coarse depth maps. To address this limitation, we propose IDESplat, which iteratively applies warp operations to boost depth probability estimation for accurate Gaussian mean prediction. First, to eliminate the inherent instability of a single warp, we introduce a Depth Probability Boosting Unit (DPBU) that integrates epipolar attention maps produced by cascading warp operations in a multiplicative manner. Next, we construct an iterative depth estimation process by stacking multiple DPBUs, progressively identifying potential depth candidates with high likelihood. As IDESplat iteratively boosts depth probability estimates and updates the depth candidates, the depth map is gradually refined, resulting in accurate Gaussian means. We conduct experiments on RealEstate10K, ACID, and DL3DV. IDESplat achieves outstanding reconstruction quality and state-of-the-art performance with real-time efficiency. On RE10K, it outperforms DepthSplat by 0.33 dB in PSNR, using only 10.7% of the parameters and 70% of the memory. Additionally, our IDESplat improves PSNR by 2.95 dB over DepthSplat on the DTU dataset in cross-dataset experiments, demonstrating its strong generalization ability.

Conclusion: FLNet为洪灾后作物损毁评估提供了低成本、可扩展、高保真的自动化解决方案，有望推动印度全国范围内从人工评估向智能评估转型。

Abstract: Distributing government relief efforts after a flood is challenging. In India, the crops are widely affected by floods; therefore, making rapid and accurate crop damage assessment is crucial for effective post-disaster agricultural management. Traditional manual surveys are slow and biased, while current satellite-based methods face challenges like cloud cover and low spatial resolution. Therefore, to bridge this gap, this paper introduced FLNet, a novel deep learning based architecture that used super-resolution to enhance the 10 m spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 satellite images into 3 m resolution before classifying damage. We tested our model on the Bihar Flood Impacted Croplands Dataset (BFCD-22), and the results showed an improved critical "Full Damage" F1-score from 0.83 to 0.89, nearly matching the 0.89 score of commercial high-resolution imagery. This work presented a cost-effective and scalable solution, paving the way for a nationwide shift from manual to automated, high-fidelity damage assessment.

HemBLIP achieves higher caption quality and morphological accuracy, while LoRA adaptation provides further gains with significantly reduced computational cost.

### [58] [FocusUI: Efficient UI Grounding via Position-Preserving Visual Token Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03928)
*Mingyu Ouyang,Kevin Qinghong Lin,Mike Zheng Shou,Hwee Tou Ng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出FocusUI框架，通过选择与指令最相关的视觉patch并保持位置连续性，实现高效的UI接地任务，显著减少计算开销并保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在UI接地任务中因处理高分辨率截图产生大量视觉token，导致计算开销大、注意力稀释；而人类交互UI时仅关注兴趣区域，因此需设计更高效的UI接地方法。

Method: 提出FocusUI框架：1）构建patch级监督信号，融合指令条件得分与基于UI图的规则得分以筛选相关且区分度高的视觉token；2）引入PosPad策略，在删除连续token序列时用单个特殊标记替代，并置于序列末尾以保持位置连续性。

Result: 在四个UI接地基准上超越GUI专用基线；ScreenSpot-Pro上FocusUI-7B比GUI-Actor-7B提升3.7%；仅保留30%视觉token时性能仅下降3.2%，推理速度提升1.44倍，GPU峰值内存降低17%。

Conclusion: FocusUI有效解决了UI接地中的token冗余与位置信息破坏问题，实现了高效与精准的平衡，为实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance in User Interface (UI) grounding tasks, driven by their ability to process increasingly high-resolution screenshots. However, screenshots are tokenized into thousands of visual tokens (e.g., about 4700 for 2K resolution), incurring significant computational overhead and diluting attention. In contrast, humans typically focus on regions of interest when interacting with UI. In this work, we pioneer the task of efficient UI grounding. Guided by practical analysis of the task's characteristics and challenges, we propose FocusUI, an efficient UI grounding framework that selects patches most relevant to the instruction while preserving positional continuity for precise grounding. FocusUI addresses two key challenges: (1) Eliminating redundant tokens in visual encoding. We construct patch-level supervision by fusing an instruction-conditioned score with a rule-based UI-graph score that down-weights large homogeneous regions to select distinct and instruction-relevant visual tokens. (2) Preserving positional continuity during visual token selection. We find that general visual token pruning methods suffer from severe accuracy degradation on UI grounding tasks due to broken positional information. We introduce a novel PosPad strategy, which compresses each contiguous sequence of dropped visual tokens into a single special marker placed at the sequence's last index to preserve positional continuity. Comprehensive experiments on four grounding benchmarks demonstrate that FocusUI surpasses GUI-specific baselines. On the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, FocusUI-7B achieves a performance improvement of 3.7% over GUI-Actor-7B. Even with only 30% visual token retention, FocusUI-7B drops by only 3.2% while achieving up to 1.44x faster inference and 17% lower peak GPU memory.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出ResTok，一种1D视觉分词器，通过构建图像与潜在标记的层次化残差结构，恢复视觉建模中的层次与残差先验，显著提升自回归图像生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有1D视觉分词器沿用语言建模范式（如Transformer），忽视视觉数据固有的层次性与残差结构，导致表征能力受限、AR建模困难。

Method: 提出Residual Tokenizer（ResTok），在图像和潜在标记上构建层次化残差表示；通过逐层合并获得跨层特征融合，并引入语义残差避免信息重叠；进一步设计层次化AR生成器，一次性预测整层潜在标记以加速采样。

Result: 在ImageNet-256上仅需9步采样即达gFID 2.34，显著优于现有方法；实验验证了层次残差先验对AR图像生成的有效性。

Conclusion: 将视觉特有的层次与残差先验重新引入1D视觉分词器，能有效提升自回归图像生成的质量与效率，ResTok为视觉生成提供了更‘视觉友好’的建模范式。

Abstract: Existing 1D visual tokenizers for autoregressive (AR) generation largely follow the design principles of language modeling, as they are built directly upon transformers whose priors originate in language, yielding single-hierarchy latent tokens and treating visual data as flat sequential token streams. However, this language-like formulation overlooks key properties of vision, particularly the hierarchical and residual network designs that have long been essential for convergence and efficiency in visual models. To bring "vision" back to vision, we propose the Residual Tokenizer (ResTok), a 1D visual tokenizer that builds hierarchical residuals for both image tokens and latent tokens. The hierarchical representations obtained through progressively merging enable cross-level feature fusion at each layer, substantially enhancing representational capacity. Meanwhile, the semantic residuals between hierarchies prevent information overlap, yielding more concentrated latent distributions that are easier for AR modeling. Cross-level bindings consequently emerge without any explicit constraints. To accelerate the generation process, we further introduce a hierarchical AR generator that substantially reduces sampling steps by predicting an entire level of latent tokens at once rather than generating them strictly token-by-token. Extensive experiments demonstrate that restoring hierarchical residual priors in visual tokenization significantly improves AR image generation, achieving a gFID of 2.34 on ImageNet-256 with only 9 sampling steps. Code is available at https://github.com/Kwai-Kolors/ResTok.

Abstract: Hands are central to interacting with our surroundings and conveying gestures, making their inclusion essential for full-body motion synthesis. Despite this, existing human motion synthesis methods fall short: some ignore hand motions entirely, while others generate full-body motions only for narrowly scoped tasks under highly constrained settings. A key obstacle is the lack of large-scale datasets that jointly capture diverse full-body motion with detailed hand articulation. While some datasets capture both, they are limited in scale and diversity. Conversely, large-scale datasets typically focus either on body motion without hands or on hand motions without the body. To overcome this, we curate and unify existing hand motion datasets with large-scale body motion data to generate full-body sequences that capture both hand and body. We then propose the first diffusion-based unconditional full-body motion prior, FUSION, which jointly models body and hand motion. Despite using a pose-based motion representation, FUSION surpasses state-of-the-art skeletal control models on the Keypoint Tracking task in the HumanML3D dataset and achieves superior motion naturalness. Beyond standard benchmarks, we demonstrate that FUSION can go beyond typical uses of motion priors through two applications: (1) generating detailed full-body motion including fingers during interaction given the motion of an object, and (2) generating Self-Interaction motions using an LLM to transform natural language cues into actionable motion constraints. For these applications, we develop an optimization pipeline that refines the latent space of our diffusion model to generate task-specific motions. Experiments on these tasks highlight precise control over hand motion while maintaining plausible full-body coordination. The code will be public.

Abstract: Commercial-grade poster design demands the seamless integration of aesthetic appeal with precise, informative content delivery. Current automated poster generation systems face significant limitations, including incomplete design workflows, poor text rendering accuracy, and insufficient flexibility for commercial applications. To address these challenges, we propose PosterVerse, a full-workflow, commercial-grade poster generation method that seamlessly automates the entire design process while delivering high-density and scalable text rendering. PosterVerse replicates professional design through three key stages: (1) blueprint creation using fine-tuned LLMs to extract key design elements from user requirements, (2) graphical background generation via customized diffusion models to create visually appealing imagery, and (3) unified layout-text rendering with an MLLM-powered HTML engine to guarantee high text accuracy and flexible customization. In addition, we introduce PosterDNA, a commercial-grade, HTML-based dataset tailored for training and validating poster design models. To the best of our knowledge, PosterDNA is the first Chinese poster generation dataset to introduce HTML typography files, enabling scalable text rendering and fundamentally solving the challenges of rendering small and high-density text. Experimental results demonstrate that PosterVerse consistently produces commercial-grade posters with appealing visuals, accurate text alignment, and customizable layouts, making it a promising solution for automating commercial poster design.

Conclusion: Padé神经元是一种更具表达力、更高效且统一的神经元建模方式，为神经网络基础单元设计提供了新范式。

Abstract: Neural networks commonly employ the McCulloch-Pitts neuron model, which is a linear model followed by a point-wise non-linear activation. Various researchers have already advanced inherently non-linear neuron models, such as quadratic neurons, generalized operational neurons, generative neurons, and super neurons, which offer stronger non-linearity compared to point-wise activation functions. In this paper, we introduce a novel and better non-linear neuron model called Padé neurons (Paons), inspired by Padé approximants. Paons offer several advantages, such as diversity of non-linearity, since each Paon learns a different non-linear function of its inputs, and layer efficiency, since Paons provide stronger non-linearity in much fewer layers compared to piecewise linear approximation. Furthermore, Paons include all previously proposed neuron models as special cases, thus any neuron model in any network can be replaced by Paons. We note that there has been a proposal to employ the Padé approximation as a generalized point-wise activation function, which is fundamentally different from our model. To validate the efficacy of Paons, in our experiments, we replace classic neurons in some well-known neural image super-resolution, compression, and classification models based on the ResNet architecture with Paons. Our comprehensive experimental results and analyses demonstrate that neural models built by Paons provide better or equal performance than their classic counterparts with a smaller number of layers. The PyTorch implementation code for Paon is open-sourced at https://github.com/onur-keles/Paon.

Conclusion: REACT填补了生成视频中结构性失真评估的空白，兼具高准确性与可解释性，为T2V模型优化提供了新工具和标准。

Abstract: Recent advances in video reward models and post-training strategies have improved text-to-video (T2V) generation. While these models typically assess visual quality, motion quality, and text alignment, they often overlook key structural distortions, such as abnormal object appearances and interactions, which can degrade the overall quality of the generative video. To address this gap, we introduce REACT, a frame-level reward model designed specifically for structural distortions evaluation in generative videos. REACT assigns point-wise scores and attribution labels by reasoning over video frames, focusing on recognizing distortions. To support this, we construct a large-scale human preference dataset, annotated based on our proposed taxonomy of structural distortions, and generate additional data using a efficient Chain-of-Thought (CoT) synthesis pipeline. REACT is trained with a two-stage framework: ((1) supervised fine-tuning with masked loss for domain knowledge injection, followed by (2) reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and pairwise rewards to enhance reasoning capability and align output scores with human preferences. During inference, a dynamic sampling mechanism is introduced to focus on frames most likely to exhibit distortion. We also present REACT-Bench, a benchmark for generative video distortion evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that REACT complements existing reward models in assessing structutal distortion, achieving both accurate quantitative evaluations and interpretable attribution analysis.

Conclusion: 该标注高效框架显著降低对人工标注的依赖，在实际风电巡检自动化中具有强实用性与可部署性。

Abstract: Reliable operation of wind turbines requires frequent inspections, as even minor surface damages can degrade aerodynamic performance, reduce energy output, and accelerate blade wear. Central to automating these inspections is the accurate segmentation of turbine blades from visual data. This task is traditionally addressed through dense, pixel-wise deep learning models. However, such methods demand extensive annotated datasets, posing scalability challenges. In this work, we introduce an annotation-efficient segmentation approach that reframes the pixel-level task into a binary region classification problem. Image regions are generated using a fully unsupervised, interpretable Modular Adaptive Region Growing technique, guided by image-specific Adaptive Thresholding and enhanced by a Region Merging process that consolidates fragmented areas into coherent segments. To improve generalization and classification robustness, we introduce RegionMix, an augmentation strategy that synthesizes new training samples by combining distinct regions.

TL;DR: 本文提出LocalDPO，一种无需外部评判模型或人工标注、基于局部时空区域偏好的文本到视频扩散模型对齐新方法，显著提升视频保真度、时序连贯性与人类偏好得分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于多样本排序和任务特定评判模型的直接偏好优化（DPO）方法效率低且监督信号模糊，难以实现细粒度对齐。

Method: LocalDPO构建来自真实视频的局部偏好对：以高质量真实视频为正样本，通过随机时空掩码局部破坏并用冻结基础模型仅修复掩码区域生成负样本；设计区域感知DPO损失，仅在被破坏区域进行偏好学习；整个流程单次推理即得偏好对，全自动高效。

Result: 在Wan2.1和CogVideoX上实验表明，LocalDPO在视频保真度、时序连贯性和人类偏好评分上持续优于其他后训练方法。

Conclusion: LocalDPO提供了一种更高效、更细粒度的视频生成器对齐范式，摆脱了对外部评判模型和人工标注的依赖。

Abstract: Aligning text-to-video diffusion models with human preferences is crucial for generating high-quality videos. Existing Direct Preference Otimization (DPO) methods rely on multi-sample ranking and task-specific critic models, which is inefficient and often yields ambiguous global supervision. To address these limitations, we propose LocalDPO, a novel post-training framework that constructs localized preference pairs from real videos and optimizes alignment at the spatio-temporal region level. We design an automated pipeline to efficiently collect preference pair data that generates preference pairs with a single inference per prompt, eliminating the need for external critic models or manual annotation. Specifically, we treat high-quality real videos as positive samples and generate corresponding negatives by locally corrupting them with random spatio-temporal masks and restoring only the masked regions using the frozen base model. During training, we introduce a region-aware DPO loss that restricts preference learning to corrupted areas for rapid convergence. Experiments on Wan2.1 and CogVideoX demonstrate that LocalDPO consistently improves video fidelity, temporal coherence and human preference scores over other post-training approaches, establishing a more efficient and fine-grained paradigm for video generator alignment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文发现大型多模态模型（LMMs）在视频推理中存在‘文本惯性’问题，即一旦出现文本幻觉，模型会忽视视觉证据而固守错误；为此提出逻辑图扰动协议评估模型自省能力，并设计无需训练的主动视觉上下文精炼方法，显著提升推理鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型（LMMs）在视频推理中虽展现强大能力，但其推理链的鲁棒性存疑，尤其存在‘文本惯性’这一关键失败模式——即文本幻觉发生后模型忽视视觉证据、盲目坚持错误文本。

Method: 提出LogicGraph扰动协议，系统注入扰动以评估不同架构LMM的自省能力；并设计无需训练的Active Visual-Context Refinement推理范式，包含主动视觉重接地机制与自适应上下文精炼策略。

Result: 实验表明：模型仅在不足10%的情况下能成功自纠，多数陷入盲目的文本错误传播；所提方法显著抑制幻觉传播，提升推理鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 文本惯性是LMM视频推理中的严重缺陷；通过结构化评估与主动视觉重接地+上下文精炼，可在不训练前提下有效增强模型推理稳健性。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in video reasoning via Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, the robustness of their reasoning chains remains questionable. In this paper, we identify a critical failure mode termed textual inertia, where once a textual hallucination occurs in the thinking process, models tend to blindly adhere to the erroneous text while neglecting conflicting visual evidence. To systematically investigate this, we propose the LogicGraph Perturbation Protocol that structurally injects perturbations into the reasoning chains of diverse LMMs spanning both native reasoning architectures and prompt-driven paradigms to evaluate their self-reflection capabilities. The results reveal that models successfully self-correct in less than 10% of cases and predominantly succumb to blind textual error propagation. To mitigate this, we introduce Active Visual-Context Refinement, a training-free inference paradigm which orchestrates an active visual re-grounding mechanism to enforce fine-grained verification coupled with an adaptive context refinement strategy to summarize and denoise the reasoning history. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly stifles hallucination propagation and enhances reasoning robustness.

TL;DR: Gen3R是一种结合基础重建模型与视频扩散模型的场景级3D生成方法，通过适配器将VGGT模型的token转化为几何潜变量，并使其与视频扩散模型的外观潜变量对齐，联合生成RGB视频与对应3D几何（如相机位姿、深度图、点云），在单/多图像条件下的3D场景生成中达到SOTA，并提升重建鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弥合基础重建模型的强几何先验与视频扩散模型的强生成先验之间的鸿沟，实现高质量、一致的3D场景生成。

Method: 提出Gen3R方法：1）复用VGGT重建模型，训练轻量适配器将其token映射为几何潜变量；2）通过正则化使几何潜变量与预训练视频扩散模型的外观潜变量对齐；3）联合生成解耦但对齐的几何与外观潜变量，解码出RGB视频及对应3D几何（相机位姿、深度图、全局点云）。

Result: 在单图像和多图像条件下的3D场景生成任务上达到SOTA性能；同时证明该方法能利用生成先验增强重建鲁棒性，验证了重建与生成模型紧耦合的互惠优势。

Conclusion: Gen3R成功实现了重建模型与生成模型的协同设计，表明解耦且对齐的潜空间建模是打通3D生成与重建的关键路径，为统一生成式3D理解与建模提供了新范式。

Abstract: We present Gen3R, a method that bridges the strong priors of foundational reconstruction models and video diffusion models for scene-level 3D generation. We repurpose the VGGT reconstruction model to produce geometric latents by training an adapter on its tokens, which are regularized to align with the appearance latents of pre-trained video diffusion models. By jointly generating these disentangled yet aligned latents, Gen3R produces both RGB videos and corresponding 3D geometry, including camera poses, depth maps, and global point clouds. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results in single- and multi-image conditioned 3D scene generation. Additionally, our method can enhance the robustness of reconstruction by leveraging generative priors, demonstrating the mutual benefit of tightly coupling reconstruction and generative models.

TL;DR: 本文提出GeoReason框架，通过构建逻辑驱动的数据集GeoReason-Bench和两阶段训练策略（监督知识初始化与一致性感知强化学习），提升遥感视觉语言模型在空间推理任务中的认知可靠性与可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遥感视觉语言模型在复杂空间任务中存在逻辑幻觉问题，即答案虽正确但推理链错误或依赖位置捷径而非空间逻辑，导致战略空间决策不可靠。

Method: 提出GeoReason框架：1）构建含4000条几何与专家知识合成推理轨迹的GeoReason-Bench数据集；2）采用两阶段训练：监督知识初始化（注入推理语法与领域知识）和一致性感知强化学习（引入基于选项置换的逻辑一致性奖励以抑制逻辑漂移）。

Result: 实验表明，该框架显著提升了RS-VLMs的认知可靠性和可解释性，在多项指标上达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: GeoReason通过同步内部推理过程与最终决策，有效缓解逻辑幻觉，为高可靠性空间推理提供了新范式。

Abstract: The evolution of Remote Sensing Vision-Language Models(RS-VLMs) emphasizes the importance of transitioning from perception-centric recognition toward high-level deductive reasoning to enhance cognitive reliability in complex spatial tasks. However, current models often suffer from logical hallucinations, where correct answers are derived from flawed reasoning chains or rely on positional shortcuts rather than spatial logic. This decoupling undermines reliability in strategic spatial decision-making. To address this, we present GeoReason, a framework designed to synchronize internal thinking with final decisions. We first construct GeoReason-Bench, a logic-driven dataset containing 4,000 reasoning trajectories synthesized from geometric primitives and expert knowledge. We then formulate a two-stage training strategy: (1) Supervised Knowledge Initialization to equip the model with reasoning syntax and domain expertise, and (2) Consistency-Aware Reinforcement Learning to refine deductive reliability. This second stage integrates a novel Logical Consistency Reward, which penalizes logical drift via an option permutation strategy to anchor decisions in verifiable reasoning traces. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances the cognitive reliability and interpretability of RS-VLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to other advanced methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于像素级二维表示与多模态对比学习（PIMC）的自监督框架，用于提升卫星图像时间序列（SITS）和遥感影像（RSI）的特征表达能力，在像素预测、分类及土地覆盖分类任务中超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型多处理整图或全长时序，难以有效建模像素级时序变化；而SITS蕴含丰富动态信息，亟需更精细、更具判别力的表示方式。

Method: 1）将NDVI/EVI/SAVI等植被指数时间序列转换为递归图（recurrence plots）作为像素级2D表示；2）提出PIxel-wise Multimodal Contrastive（PIMC）自监督学习方法，联合优化SITS 2D表示与对应遥感影像的编码器。

Result: 在PASTIS（像素级预测与分类）和EuroSAT（土地覆盖分类）三个下游任务上均优于SOTA方法；验证了2D表示增强特征提取能力，且对比学习显著提升SITS与RSI表征质量。

Conclusion: 所提多模态自监督框架能更有效地挖掘SITS时空动态信息，为地球观测任务提供鲁棒、可迁移的特征学习范式。

Abstract: Satellites continuously generate massive volumes of data, particularly for Earth observation, including satellite image time series (SITS). However, most deep learning models are designed to process either entire images or complete time series sequences to extract meaningful features for downstream tasks. In this study, we propose a novel multimodal approach that leverages pixel-wise two-dimensional (2D) representations to encode visual property variations from SITS more effectively. Specifically, we generate recurrence plots from pixel-based vegetation index time series (NDVI, EVI, and SAVI) as an alternative to using raw pixel values, creating more informative representations. Additionally, we introduce PIxel-wise Multimodal Contrastive (PIMC), a new multimodal self-supervision approach that produces effective encoders based on two-dimensional pixel time series representations and remote sensing imagery (RSI). To validate our approach, we assess its performance on three downstream tasks: pixel-level forecasting and classification using the PASTIS dataset, and land cover classification on the EuroSAT dataset. Moreover, we compare our results to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on all downstream tasks. Our experimental results show that the use of 2D representations significantly enhances feature extraction from SITS, while contrastive learning improves the quality of representations for both pixel time series and RSI. These findings suggest that our multimodal method outperforms existing models in various Earth observation tasks, establishing it as a robust self-supervision framework for processing both SITS and RSI.

*Jun Wang,Chunyu Qiang,Yuxin Guo,Yiran Wang,Xijuan Zeng,Chen Zhang,Pengfei Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Klear is a novel audio-video joint generation model that addresses key challenges like asynchrony and poor lip-speech alignment via a unified single-tower DiT architecture, progressive multitask training, and a large-scale densely captioned audio-video dataset with automated curation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing non-commercial audio-video generation methods suffer from audio-visual asynchrony, poor lip-speech alignment, and unimodal degradation due to weak audio-visual correspondence modeling, limited generalization, and lack of high-quality dense-caption data.

Method: Klear introduces (1) a single-tower architecture with unified DiT blocks and Omni-Full Attention; (2) a progressive multitask training strategy including random modality masking and multistage curriculum learning; and (3) a novel automated pipeline to build the first large-scale audio-video dataset with dense captions and strict alignment.

Result: Klear achieves high-fidelity, semantically and temporally aligned, instruction-following audio-video generation in both joint and unimodal settings, generalizes robustly to out-of-distribution scenarios, and outperforms prior methods significantly—matching Veo 3's performance.

Conclusion: Klear provides a unified, scalable framework for next-generation audio-video synthesis by jointly advancing model architecture, training methodology, and data curation.

Abstract: Audio-video joint generation has progressed rapidly, yet substantial challenges still remain. Non-commercial approaches still suffer audio-visual asynchrony, poor lip-speech alignment, and unimodal degradation, which can be stemmed from weak audio-visual correspondence modeling, limited generalization, and scarce high-quality dense-caption data. To address these issues, we introduce Klear and delve into three axes--model architecture, training strategy, and data curation. Architecturally, we adopt a single-tower design with unified DiT blocks and an Omni-Full Attention mechanism, achieving tight audio-visual alignment and strong scalability. Training-wise, we adopt a progressive multitask regime--random modality masking to joint optimization across tasks, and a multistage curriculum, yielding robust representations, strengthening A-V aligned world knowledge, and preventing unimodal collapse. For datasets, we present the first large-scale audio-video dataset with dense captions, and introduce a novel automated data-construction pipeline which annotates and filters millions of diverse, high-quality, strictly aligned audio-video-caption triplets. Building on this, Klear scales to large datasets, delivering high-fidelity, semantically and temporally aligned, instruction-following generation in both joint and unimodal settings while generalizing robustly to out-of-distribution scenarios. Across tasks, it substantially outperforms prior methods by a large margin and achieves performance comparable to Veo 3, offering a unified, scalable path toward next-generation audio-video synthesis.

TL;DR: 本文提出Diffusion-DRF，一种无需额外奖励模型或偏好数据集、基于冻结视觉语言模型（VLM）作为可微 critic 的视频扩散模型微调方法，通过在去噪过程中反向传播VLM反馈实现高效稳定优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DPO方法依赖非可微的人类标注或学习型奖励模型，导致标注成本高、易受偏差影响、易被奖励黑客攻击且训练不稳定。

Method: 提出Diffusion-DRF：利用冻结的现成VLM作为无训练critic，将VLM的logit响应转化为token-aware梯度，并沿扩散去噪链进行可微回传；设计自动化、面向维度的提示管道获取多维VLM反馈；结合梯度检查点提升计算效率。

Result: 在不引入额外奖励模型或偏好数据集的前提下，显著提升视频质量与文本语义对齐，缓解奖励黑客行为和模式坍缩，且具备模型无关性和任务泛化性。

Conclusion: Diffusion-DRF为T2V生成提供了一种更鲁棒、高效、免训练奖励建模的可微优化范式，可推广至其他扩散生成任务。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently improved Text-to-Video (T2V) generation by enhancing visual fidelity and text alignment. However, current methods rely on non-differentiable preference signals from human annotations or learned reward models. This reliance makes training label-intensive, bias-prone, and easy-to-game, which often triggers reward hacking and unstable training. We propose Diffusion-DRF, a differentiable reward flow for fine-tuning video diffusion models using a frozen, off-the-shelf Vision-Language Model (VLM) as a training-free critic. Diffusion-DRF directly backpropagates VLM feedback through the diffusion denoising chain, converting logit-level responses into token-aware gradients for optimization. We propose an automated, aspect-structured prompting pipeline to obtain reliable multi-dimensional VLM feedback, while gradient checkpointing enables efficient updates through the final denoising steps. Diffusion-DRF improves video quality and semantic alignment while mitigating reward hacking and collapse -- without additional reward models or preference datasets. It is model-agnostic and readily generalizes to other diffusion-based generative tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出ToTMNet，一种轻量级远程光电容积描记（rPPG）模型，用FFT加速的Toeplitz时序混合层替代计算昂贵的注意力机制，在保持全序列感受野的同时实现近线性时间复杂度和仅63k参数；在UBFC-rPPG和SCAMPS数据集上取得高心率估计精度，验证了Toeplitz结构是rPPG中替代注意力的高效可行方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度rPPG方法虽提升鲁棒性，但常带来高计算开销、大参数量，尤其注意力机制存在时序长度上的二次复杂度问题，亟需更高效的长程时序建模方式。

Method: 提出ToTMNet：采用FFT加速的Toeplitz时序混合层替代时间注意力，利用循环嵌入与FFT卷积实现近线性计算；设计紧凑型门控时序混合器，融合局部深度可分离时序卷积与门控全局Toeplitz混合。

Result: 在UBFC-rPPG上MAE为1.055 bpm（Pearson=0.996）；跨域（SCAMPS→UBFC-rPPG）MAE为1.582 bpm（Pearson=0.994）；消融证实门控机制对提升Toeplitz混合在域偏移下的有效性至关重要。

Conclusion: Toeplitz结构化时序混合是一种实用、高效且参数经济的注意力替代方案，适用于资源受限的rPPG任务；当前研究局限在于仅验证于两个数据集。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) estimates a blood volume pulse (BVP) waveform from facial videos captured by commodity cameras. Although recent deep models improve robustness compared to classical signal-processing approaches, many methods increase computational cost and parameter count, and attention-based temporal modeling introduces quadratic scaling with respect to the temporal length. This paper proposes ToTMNet, a lightweight rPPG architecture that replaces temporal attention with an FFT-accelerated Toeplitz temporal mixing layer. The Toeplitz operator provides full-sequence temporal receptive field using a linear number of parameters in the clip length and can be applied in near-linear time using circulant embedding and FFT-based convolution. ToTMNet integrates the global Toeplitz temporal operator into a compact gated temporal mixer that combines a local depthwise temporal convolution branch with gated global Toeplitz mixing, enabling efficient long-range temporal filtering while only having 63k parameters. Experiments on two datasets, UBFC-rPPG (real videos) and SCAMPS (synthetic videos), show that ToTMNet achieves strong heart-rate estimation accuracy with a compact design. On UBFC-rPPG intra-dataset evaluation, ToTMNet reaches 1.055 bpm MAE with Pearson correlation 0.996. In a synthetic-to-real setting (SCAMPS to UBFC-rPPG), ToTMNet reaches 1.582 bpm MAE with Pearson correlation 0.994. Ablation results confirm that the gating mechanism is important for effectively using global Toeplitz mixing, especially under domain shift. The main limitation of this preprint study is the use of only two datasets; nevertheless, the results indicate that Toeplitz-structured temporal mixing is a practical and efficient alternative to attention for rPPG.

Method: 采用2D图像表示，为每张图像附加估计的深度图以增强几何结构表达；结合稠密匹配器、紧凑压缩与GPU加速的LO-RANSAC实现高效计算与存储。

Result: 在多个标准基准上达到最高精度，尤其在挑战性条件下表现突出；相比其他内存高效方法，在相近地图尺寸下精度更优。

Conclusion: 基于增强2D表示的视觉定位方法可兼顾实用性、可扩展性与高精度，为轻量级高精度定位提供了新范式。

Abstract: Existing visual localization methods are typically either 2D image-based, which are easy to build and maintain but limited in effective geometric reasoning, or 3D structure-based, which achieve high accuracy but require a centralized reconstruction and are difficult to update. In this work, we revisit visual localization with a 2D image-based representation and propose to augment each image with estimated depth maps to capture the geometric structure. Supported by the effective use of dense matchers, this representation is not only easy to build and maintain, but achieves highest accuracy in challenging conditions. With compact compression and a GPU-accelerated LO-RANSAC implementation, the whole pipeline is efficient in both storage and computation and allows for a flexible trade-off between accuracy and highest memory efficiency. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy on various standard benchmarks and outperforms existing memory-efficient methods at comparable map sizes.

Motivation: 现有深度研究代理主要优化检索策略，但存在检索到黄金证据后因上下文盲区而无法有效利用的问题（检索-利用鸿沟）。

Method: 提出DeepResearch-Slice神经符号框架，不依赖隐式注意力，而是预测精确的文本span索引，执行确定性硬过滤，再进行推理。

Result: 在六个基准上验证，对冻结主干模型实现73%相对提升（19.1%→33.0%），无需更新推理模型参数即可有效抑制噪声。

Conclusion: 开放性研究需引入显式锚定机制，以提升证据利用效率和推理鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deep Research agents predominantly optimize search policies to maximize retrieval probability. However, we identify a critical bottleneck: the retrieval-utilization gap, where models fail to use gold evidence even after it is retrieved, due to context blindness in noisy environments. To bridge this gap, we propose DeepResearch-Slice, a simple yet effective neuro-symbolic framework. Unlike implicit attention, our approach predicts precise span indices to perform a deterministic hard filter before reasoning. Extensive evaluations across six benchmarks show substantial robustness gains. Applying our method to frozen backbones yields a 73 percent relative improvement, from 19.1 percent to 33.0 percent, effectively mitigating noise without requiring parameter updates to the reasoning model. These results highlight the need for explicit grounding mechanisms in open-ended research.

TL;DR: 本文研究大语言模型的谄媚倾向（sycophancy），发现仅靠内部推理（如思维链）无法有效缓解，反而在弱模型中导致性能崩溃，在强模型中仍存在11.4%的错误率；而外部调节机制RCA可彻底消除该问题（0.0%），并提出热力学层级框架解释系统协同效率，强调外部结构约束对安全性的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大语言模型的谄媚倾向是否必须依赖外部监管，还是仅靠内部推理即可缓解。

Method: 在CAP-GSM8K（N=500）对抗数据集上，对比评估内部机制（思维链CoT）与外部机制（RCA）在GPT-3.5、GPT-4o和GPT-5.1上的表现，并提出热力学层级框架解释系统行为。

Result: 内部推理在弱模型中引发性能崩溃（优先级悖论），在前沿模型中仍有11.4%输出差距；RCA则在所有模型上实现0.0%谄媚率；混合系统仅在能力匹配且强大时达到最优共振，否则陷入失谐与熵增。

Conclusion: 外部结构性约束是保障模型安全的必要条件，仅靠内部推理无法可靠消除谄媚倾向。

Abstract: Large Language Models frequently exhibit sycophancy, prioritizing user agreeableness over correctness. We investigate whether this requires external regulation or can be mitigated by internal reasoning alone. Using CAP-GSM8K (N=500), an adversarial dataset, we evaluate internal (CoT) versus external (RCA) mechanisms across GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, and GPT-5.1. Our results reveal the structural limits of internal reasoning: it causes performance collapse in weak models (the Prioritization Paradox) and leaves an 11.4\% final output gap in frontier models. In contrast, RCA structurally eliminates sycophancy (0.0\%) across all tiers. We synthesize these findings into a thermodynamic hierarchy: hybrid systems achieve Resonance (optimal efficiency) only when capabilities are matched and strong, while weak or mismatched pairs succumb to Dissonance and Entropy. This confirms that external structural constraints are strictly necessary to guarantee safety.

Conclusion: Jailbreak-Zero提供了一种更可扩展、更全面的大语言模型安全漏洞识别与缓解方案，推动红队测试从示例驱动迈向策略驱动范式。

Abstract: This paper introduces Jailbreak-Zero, a novel red teaming methodology that shifts the paradigm of Large Language Model (LLM) safety evaluation from a constrained example-based approach to a more expansive and effective policy-based framework. By leveraging an attack LLM to generate a high volume of diverse adversarial prompts and then fine-tuning this attack model with a preference dataset, Jailbreak-Zero achieves Pareto optimality across the crucial objectives of policy coverage, attack strategy diversity, and prompt fidelity to real user inputs. The empirical evidence demonstrates the superiority of this method, showcasing significantly higher attack success rates against both open-source and proprietary models like GPT-40 and Claude 3.5 when compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques. Crucially, Jailbreak-Zero accomplishes this while producing human-readable and effective adversarial prompts with minimal need for human intervention, thereby presenting a more scalable and comprehensive solution for identifying and mitigating the safety vulnerabilities of LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced in clinical decision-making, yet the deployment of proprietary systems is hindered by privacy concerns and reliance on cloud-based infrastructure. Open-source alternatives allow local inference but often require large model sizes that limit their use in resource-constrained clinical settings. Here, we benchmark two on-device LLMs, gpt-oss-20b and gpt-oss-120b, across three representative clinical tasks: general disease diagnosis, specialty-specific (ophthalmology) diagnosis and management, and simulation of human expert grading and evaluation. We compare their performance with state-of-the-art proprietary models (GPT-5 and o4-mini) and a leading open-source model (DeepSeek-R1), and we further evaluate the adaptability of on-device systems by fine-tuning gpt-oss-20b on general diagnostic data. Across tasks, gpt-oss models achieve performance comparable to or exceeding DeepSeek-R1 and o4-mini despite being substantially smaller. In addition, fine-tuning remarkably improves the diagnostic accuracy of gpt-oss-20b, enabling it to approach the performance of GPT-5. These findings highlight the potential of on-device LLMs to deliver accurate, adaptable, and privacy-preserving clinical decision support, offering a practical pathway for broader integration of LLMs into routine clinical practice.

TL;DR: GPT-5 是一个统一系统，包含快速响应的主模型、深度推理模型及实时路由机制，能根据对话类型、复杂度和用户意图动态调度模型；显著降低幻觉、提升指令遵循与安全性，并在写作、编程和健康领域表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升模型实用性与安全性，解决前代模型在真实场景中幻觉多、指令遵循差、易谄媚等问题，并应对生物/化学等高风险领域的潜在滥用风险。

Method: 构建三模块统一系统（gpt-5-main、gpt-5-thinking、实时路由器），路由器基于用户行为信号持续优化；引入safe-completions安全训练机制，并依据Preparedness Framework对高能力模型实施前置防护。

Result: 在基准测试和真实查询中均超越前代模型，显著降低幻觉率，增强指令遵循与抗谄媚能力，在写作、编码、健康三大高频场景性能跃升；gpt-5-thinking被列为生物/化学领域高能力模型并启用对应安全措施。

Conclusion: GPT-5代表了大模型系统化设计的重要进展，兼顾性能、效率与安全性，其路由架构与预备性安全框架为未来AI系统提供了可扩展范式。

Abstract: This is the system card published alongside the OpenAI GPT-5 launch, August 2025.
  GPT-5 is a unified system with a smart and fast model that answers most questions, a deeper reasoning model for harder problems, and a real-time router that quickly decides which model to use based on conversation type, complexity, tool needs, and explicit intent (for example, if you say 'think hard about this' in the prompt). The router is continuously trained on real signals, including when users switch models, preference rates for responses, and measured correctness, improving over time. Once usage limits are reached, a mini version of each model handles remaining queries.
  This system card focuses primarily on gpt-5-thinking and gpt-5-main, while evaluations for other models are available in the appendix. The GPT-5 system not only outperforms previous models on benchmarks and answers questions more quickly, but -- more importantly -- is more useful for real-world queries. We've made significant advances in reducing hallucinations, improving instruction following, and minimizing sycophancy, and have leveled up GPT-5's performance in three of ChatGPT's most common uses: writing, coding, and health. All of the GPT-5 models additionally feature safe-completions, our latest approach to safety training to prevent disallowed content.
  Similarly to ChatGPT agent, we have decided to treat gpt-5-thinking as High capability in the Biological and Chemical domain under our Preparedness Framework, activating the associated safeguards. While we do not have definitive evidence that this model could meaningfully help a novice to create severe biological harm -- our defined threshold for High capability -- we have chosen to take a precautionary approach.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种专为小型语言模型（SLMs）设计的新型评估框架，聚焦于非推理类实际应用任务（如语气修改），弥补了现有以推理能力为主的基准测试对SLM工业价值的低估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM主导的评估范式（如推理、问题求解）严重低估了SLMs在工业常见非推理任务（如语气调整）中的实用价值，缺乏适配SLMs的、面向实际应用场景的评估方法。

Method: 构建了一个面向非推理任务的评估框架，融合了创新的数据生成策略、提示调优（prompt-tuning）和大模型辅助评估（LLM-based evaluation），并强调任务特定微调（task-specific finetuning）的有效性。

Result: 实验证明该框架能有效揭示SLMs在 tone modification 等实际任务中远超其在传统推理基准上表现的能力，验证了其在边缘计算与私有计算等场景的实用潜力。

Conclusion: SLMs虽在通用推理基准上逊于LLMs，但在大量现实工业任务中极具竞争力；本工作提供了更公平、更实用的评估工具，推动SLMs在资源受限与隐私敏感场景的落地。

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has shifted language model evaluation toward reasoning and problem-solving tasks as measures of general intelligence. Small Language Models (SLMs) -- defined here as models under 10B parameters -- typically score 3-4 times lower than LLMs on these metrics. However, we demonstrate that these evaluations fail to capture SLMs' effectiveness in common industrial applications, such as tone modification tasks (e.g., funny, serious, professional). We propose an evaluation framework specifically designed to highlight SLMs' capabilities in non-reasoning tasks where predefined evaluation datasets don't exist. Our framework combines novel approaches in data generation, prompt-tuning, and LLM-based evaluation to demonstrate the potential of task-specific finetuning. This work provides practitioners with tools to effectively benchmark both SLMs and LLMs for practical applications, particularly in edge and private computing scenarios. Our implementation is available at: https://github.com/amazon-science/wraval.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在自然语言理解与生成方面表现出色，但在企业环境中部署时暴露出对自定义指令一致性遵循不足的关键局限。

Method: 通过系统性测试与企业级评估协议，对13种主流LLM在指令合规性、响应准确性及真实RAG场景下的性能指标进行综合评估。

Result: 不同模型在指令遵循能力上差异显著，Claude-Sonnet-4和GPT-5表现最优；研究确认了‘指令差距’这一根本性挑战。

Conclusion: 该工作为企业部署LLM应用提供了实用指导，并建立了跨主流模型家族的指令遵循能力基准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, yet their deployment in enterprise environments reveals a critical limitation: inconsistent adherence to custom instructions. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of 13 leading LLMs across instruction compliance, response accuracy, and performance metrics in realworld RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) scenarios. Through systematic testing with samples and enterprise-grade evaluation protocols, we demonstrate that instruction following varies dramatically across models, with Claude-Sonnet-4 and GPT-5 achieving the highest results. Our findings reveal the "instruction gap" - a fundamental challenge where models excel at general tasks but struggle with precise instruction adherence required for enterprise deployment. This work provides practical insights for organizations deploying LLM-powered solutions and establishes benchmarks for instruction-following capabilities across major model families.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种无需历史模型性能数据的历史无关测试集压缩框架，通过领域自适应语义嵌入与任务感知聚类，结合新型数据集X光机制动态调节压缩强度，在保持高保真度的同时将评估成本降低90%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有垂直领域LLM评测基准存在语义冗余和计算开销大问题，且主流压缩方法（如tinyBenchmarks）依赖多模型在全量测试集上的正确性标签，无法适用于新任务、新领域或新模型等冷启动场景。

Method: 首先在少量领域数据上微调基础LLM以捕获任务语义；然后仅基于原始文本生成高阶语义嵌入；在该领域适配嵌入空间中进行任务感知聚类，并引入‘数据集X光’机制分析簇几何结构，动态校准压缩强度。

Result: 在3GPP通信等专业领域数据集上实验表明，该方法可有效识别并剔除冗余样本，评估成本降低超90%，同时保持对全量基准的高保真度。

Conclusion: 所提历史无关压缩框架解决了冷启动下评测基准高效压缩的难题，为LLM在新兴垂直领域的快速、低成本评估提供了可行路径。

Abstract: The versatility of Large Language Models (LLMs) in vertical domains has spurred the development of numerous specialized evaluation benchmarks. However, these benchmarks often suffer from significant semantic redundancy and impose high computational costs during evaluation. Existing compression methods, such as tinyBenchmarks depend critically on correctness labels from multiple historical models evaluated on the full test set, making them inapplicable in cold-start scenarios, such as the introduction of a new task, domain, or model with no prior evaluation history.
  To address this limitation, we propose a history-free test set compression framework that requires no prior model performance data. Our method begins by fine-tuning a base LLM on a small amount of domain-specific data to internalize task-relevant semantics. It then generates high-level semantic embeddings for all original test samples using only their raw textual content. In this domain-adapted embedding space, we perform task-aware clustering and introduce a novel dataset X-ray mechanism that analyzes cluster geometry to dynamically calibrate the compression intensity based on the intrinsic redundancy of the benchmark.
  Experiments on professional-domain dataset, notably a large-scale 3GPP communications benchmark, demonstrate that our approach effectively identifies and removes redundant samples, reducing evaluation cost by over 90% while preserving high fidelity to the full benchmark.

TL;DR: 本文提出SegNSP方法，将线性文本分段任务建模为无标签的下一句预测（NSP）任务，通过改进的分割感知损失和难负样本采样，在CitiLink-Minutes和WikiSection数据集上取得优于基线的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性文本分段任务长期面临话题边界定义难、语篇结构多变、局部连贯性与全局上下文需兼顾等挑战，影响下游NLP应用效果。

Method: 将文本分段建模为无监督/弱监督的下一句预测（NSP）任务，设计标签无关的NSP判别器，并引入分割感知损失与难负样本采样策略，避免依赖显式话题标注或辅助分类任务。

Result: 在新建的CitiLink-Minutes基准上达到B-F1=0.79，在WikiSection上达B-F1=0.65，较最强可复现基线TopSeg提升0.17绝对点。

Conclusion: 重新挖掘NSP对句子间连续性的建模能力，可有效提升文本分段质量，且无需话题标签监督，具备良好泛化性与实用性。

Abstract: Linear text segmentation is a long-standing problem in natural language processing (NLP), focused on dividing continuous text into coherent and semantically meaningful units. Despite its importance, the task remains challenging due to the complexity of defining topic boundaries, the variability in discourse structure, and the need to balance local coherence with global context. These difficulties hinder downstream applications such as summarization, information retrieval, and question answering. In this work, we introduce SegNSP, framing linear text segmentation as a next sentence prediction (NSP) task. Although NSP has largely been abandoned in modern pre-training, its explicit modeling of sentence-to-sentence continuity makes it a natural fit for detecting topic boundaries. We propose a label-agnostic NSP approach, which predicts whether the next sentence continues the current topic without requiring explicit topic labels, and enhance it with a segmentation-aware loss combined with harder negative sampling to better capture discourse continuity. Unlike recent proposals that leverage NSP alongside auxiliary topic classification, our approach avoids task-specific supervision. We evaluate our model against established baselines on two datasets, CitiLink-Minutes, for which we establish the first segmentation benchmark, and WikiSection. On CitiLink-Minutes, SegNSP achieves a B-$F_1$ of 0.79, closely aligning with human-annotated topic transitions, while on WikiSection it attains a B-F$_1$ of 0.65, outperforming the strongest reproducible baseline, TopSeg, by 0.17 absolute points. These results demonstrate competitive and robust performance, highlighting the effectiveness of modeling sentence-to-sentence continuity for improving segmentation quality and supporting downstream NLP applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出了GuardEval多视角安全基准数据集和基于其训练的GemmaGuard（GGuard）内容审核模型，旨在解决现有大语言模型在隐含冒犯性、偏见和越狱提示等复杂安全问题上的检测不足。实验表明GGuard在细粒度标签评估中显著优于OpenAI Moderator和Llama Guard。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM内容审核系统在处理隐含冒犯、细微偏见和jailbreak提示等主观性强、语境依赖高的安全问题时表现不佳，且易因训练数据偏差导致不一致和伦理问题。

Method: 构建包含106个细粒度类别的多视角基准数据集GuardEval，并基于其使用QLoRA微调Gemma3-12B得到GGuard模型；采用宏观F1分数等指标进行评估。

Result: GGuard在GuardEval上取得宏观F1得分为0.832，显著优于OpenAI Moderator（0.64）和Llama Guard（0.61）；验证了多视角、以人为中心的安全基准对提升审核公平性与鲁棒性的关键作用。

Conclusion: 多样、具代表性的数据能实质性提升内容审核模型在复杂边界案例中的安全性、公平性与鲁棒性；GuardEval与GGuard共同证明了多视角安全评估范式的有效性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become deeply embedded in daily life, the urgent need for safer moderation systems, distinguishing between naive from harmful requests while upholding appropriate censorship boundaries, has never been greater. While existing LLMs can detect harmful or unsafe content, they often struggle with nuanced cases such as implicit offensiveness, subtle gender and racial biases, and jailbreak prompts, due to the subjective and context-dependent nature of these issues. Furthermore, their heavy reliance on training data can reinforce societal biases, resulting in inconsistent and ethically problematic outputs. To address these challenges, we introduce GuardEval, a unified multi-perspective benchmark dataset designed for both training and evaluation, containing 106 fine-grained categories spanning human emotions, offensive and hateful language, gender and racial bias, and broader safety concerns. We also present GemmaGuard (GGuard), a QLoRA fine-tuned version of Gemma3-12B trained on GuardEval, to assess content moderation with fine-grained labels. Our evaluation shows that GGuard achieves a macro F1 score of 0.832, substantially outperforming leading moderation models, including OpenAI Moderator (0.64) and Llama Guard (0.61). We show that multi-perspective, human-centered safety benchmarks are critical for reducing biased and inconsistent moderation decisions. GuardEval and GGuard together demonstrate that diverse, representative data materially improve safety, fairness, and robustness on complex, borderline cases.

The package includes functions for text chunking, LLM-based annotation, character name disambiguation, quality scoring, and computation of character-level statistics and embeddings. Researchers can use any LLM, commercial, open-source, or custom, within LLM_annotate. Through tutorial examples using The Simpsons Movie and the novel Pride and Prejudice, I demonstrate the usage of the package for efficient and reproducible character analyses.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于生成式大语言模型（LLMs）的重叠递归提示策略用于主题分割，并引入边界相似性评估指标，结果表明LLMs在主题分割上优于现有方法，但仍存在需解决的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于句子语义相似性的主题分割方法缺乏长程依赖建模能力和LLMs所具有的广泛知识，因此探索利用LLMs进行主题分割具有重要意义。

Method: 提出一种基于句子枚举的重叠与递归提示策略，并支持采用边界相似性（boundary similarity）作为评估指标。

Result: 实验表明，LLMs在主题分割任务上可比现有方法更有效，但其稳定性与可靠性仍待提升。

Conclusion: LLMs具备主题分割潜力，但尚不能完全替代传统方法，需进一步研究以解决当前局限性。

Abstract: Topic segmentation using generative Large Language Models (LLMs) remains relatively unexplored. Previous methods use semantic similarity between sentences, but such models lack the long range dependencies and vast knowledge found in LLMs. In this work, we propose an overlapping and recursive prompting strategy using sentence enumeration. We also support the adoption of the boundary similarity evaluation metric. Results show that LLMs can be more effective segmenters than existing methods, but issues remain to be solved before they can be relied upon for topic segmentation.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在边缘设备部署受限于'内存墙'瓶颈，即数据搬运延迟远超计算吞吐；现有运行时因高层抽象、动态分发和未对齐访存引入显著开销。

Method: 提出纯软件实现的'虚拟张量核'架构：采用mmap替代标准容器实现直接内存映射；设计手调NEON SIMD内核；定义Tensor Virtualization Layout（TVL）确保权重矩阵100%缓存行利用率；构建零拷贝加载器消除初始化延迟。

Result: 在M2硬件上，对1.1亿参数模型实现>60 tokens/秒的稳定推理吞吐；满足200ms心理语言学延迟阈值；提供开源、可移植、确定性的ARM通用硅片内存瓶颈研究基准。

Conclusion: 纯软件虚拟张量核可在无专用硬件（如AMX）条件下，高效缓解ARM边缘设备的内存墙问题，为低延迟LLM推理提供轻量、透明、可控的系统级解决方案。

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is fundamentally constrained by the "Memory Wall" the bottleneck where data movement latency outstrips arithmetic throughput. Standard inference runtimes often incur significant overhead through high-level abstractions, dynamic dispatch, and unaligned memory access patterns. In this work, we present a novel "Virtual Tensor Core" architecture implemented in software, optimized specifically for ARM64 microarchitectures (Apple Silicon). By bypassing standard library containers in favor of direct memory mapping (mmap) and implementing hand-tuned NEON SIMD kernels, we achieve a form of "Software-Defined Direct Memory Access (DMA)." Our proposed Tensor Virtualization Layout (TVL) guarantees 100% cache line utilization for weight matrices, while our zero-copy loader eliminates initialization latency. Experimental results on a 110M parameter model demonstrate a stable throughput of >60 tokens/second on M2 hardware. While proprietary hardware accelerators (e.g., Apple AMX) can achieve higher peak throughput, our architecture provides a fully open, portable, and deterministic reference implementation for studying the memory bottleneck on general-purpose ARM silicon, meeting the 200ms psycholinguistic latency threshold without opaque dependencies.

TL;DR: 本文研究了字节对编码（BPE）如何改变自然语言语料库的统计特性，发现BPE递归应用使词频趋向齐普夫幂律，并使模型预测熵与齐普夫理论预测逐渐一致，表明BPE不仅是压缩机制，更是一种重构语言信息特性的统计变换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管自然语言具有齐普夫律和希普斯律等统计规律，但这些规律与现代Transformer模型所用的分词方案（如BPE）之间的关系尚不清楚。

Method: 基于齐普夫频率分布假设分析语料的信息内容（香农熵），推导槽熵期望值闭式表达；实证研究BPE对语料统计的影响；训练不同BPE深度下的语言模型并分析其预测熵；使用基于注意力的诊断方法检验局部依赖性变化。

Result: BPE递归应用使词频趋近齐普夫幂律，经验熵呈现特征性增长；随着BPE深度增加，Transformer模型的预测熵越来越符合齐普夫理论预测；更深的分词降低了局部词元依赖性，使经验分布更接近弱依赖（近独立同分布）状态。

Conclusion: BPE不仅是一种压缩机制，更是一种统计变换，能重建自然语言的关键信息属性。

Abstract: Natural languages exhibit striking regularities in their statistical structure, including notably the emergence of Zipf's and Heaps' laws. Despite this, it remains broadly unclear how these properties relate to the modern tokenisation schemes used in contemporary transformer models. In this note, we analyse the information content (as measured by the Shannon entropy) of various corpora under the assumption of a Zipfian frequency distribution, and derive a closed-form expression for the slot entropy expectation value. We then empirically investigate how byte--pair encoding (BPE) transforms corpus statistics, showing that recursive applications of BPE drive token frequencies toward a Zipfian power law while inducing a characteristic growth pattern in empirical entropy. Utilizing the ability of transformers to learn context dependent token probability distributions, we train language models on corpora tokenised at varying BPE depths, revealing that the model predictive entropies increasingly agree with Zipf-derived predictions as the BPE depth increases. Attention-based diagnostics further indicate that deeper tokenisation reduces local token dependencies, bringing the empirical distribution closer to the weakly dependent (near IID) regime. Together, these results clarify how BPE acts not only as a compression mechanism but also as a statistical transform that reconstructs key informational properties of natural language.

TL;DR: 本文研究隐喻如何影响大语言模型（LLM）的推理路径，发现训练数据中的隐喻与模型跨领域错对齐程度存在强因果关系，并通过干预不同训练阶段的隐喻使用可显著改变错对齐程度；进一步揭示隐喻激活全局与局部潜在特征，据此构建高精度错对齐内容检测器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期研究表明隐喻影响人类决策，而LLM训练数据富含隐喻，因此自然引发隐喻是否也影响LLM推理路径的疑问；同时聚焦于新兴的‘错对齐’问题——即LLM将某领域中从错对齐内容学到的模式泛化到其他领域。

Method: 通过在预训练、微调和再对齐阶段对隐喻进行系统性干预，量化其对LLM跨领域错对齐程度的影响；结合潜变量分析，监测隐喻触发的全局与局部潜在特征激活模式，并基于此设计错对齐内容检测器。

Result: 证实隐喻与LLM错对齐程度存在强因果关系；干预隐喻使用可显著调控错对齐程度；发现隐喻特异性地激活特定全局与局部潜在特征；所构建的检测器能高精度预测错对齐内容。

Conclusion: 隐喻不仅是语言现象，更是影响LLM内部推理机制与对齐状态的关键因素；应将隐喻建模纳入LLM对齐与可解释性研究框架。

Abstract: Earlier research has shown that metaphors influence human's decision making, which raises the question of whether metaphors also influence large language models (LLMs)' reasoning pathways, considering their training data contain a large number of metaphors. In this work, we investigate the problem in the scope of the emergent misalignment problem where LLMs can generalize patterns learned from misaligned content in one domain to another domain. We discover a strong causal relationship between metaphors in training data and the misalignment degree of LLMs' reasoning contents. With interventions using metaphors in pre-training, fine-tuning and re-alignment phases, models' cross-domain misalignment degrees change significantly. As we delve deeper into the causes behind this phenomenon, we observe that there is a connection between metaphors and the activation of global and local latent features of large reasoning models. By monitoring these latent features, we design a detector that predict misaligned content with high accuracy.

*Maan Qraitem,Kate Saenko,Bryan A. Plummer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出PersonaWeaver框架，通过解耦角色构建（如身份、人口统计）与行为构建（如道德立场、互动风格），缓解现有角色生成方法中的正向道德偏差和助手式偏差，从而生成更具戏剧张力与多样性（包括反应、道德观及表达风格）的虚拟角色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于最大似然训练和助手微调的角色生成方法存在两种对齐诱导偏差：正向道德偏差（角色总是持赞同性道德立场）和助手偏差（角色总是直接回答问题），导致角色缺乏戏剧张力和多样性。

Method: 提出PersonaWeaver框架，将世界构建（角色身份、人口特征等）与行为构建（道德立场、互动风格等）解耦，并支持第二阶多样性（如文本长度、语气、标点等风格标记）。

Result: 生成的角色展现出更丰富的道德立场、反应多样性以及表达风格多样性，显著缓解了原有偏差。

Conclusion: 解耦角色的结构性属性与行为性属性是提升虚拟角色真实感与叙事潜力的有效路径，PersonaWeaver为大规模、多样化角色生成提供了新范式。

Abstract: Procedural content generation has enabled vast virtual worlds through levels, maps, and quests, but large-scale character generation remains underexplored. We identify two alignment-induced biases in existing methods: a positive moral bias, where characters uniformly adopt agreeable stances (e.g. always saying lying is bad), and a helpful assistant bias, where characters invariably answer questions directly (e.g. never refusing or deflecting). While such tendencies suit instruction-following systems, they suppress dramatic tension and yield predictable characters, stemming from maximum likelihood training and assistant fine-tuning. To address this, we introduce PersonaWeaver, a framework that disentangles world-building (roles, demographics) from behavioral-building (moral stances, interactional styles), yielding characters with more diverse reactions and moral stances, as well as second-order diversity in stylistic markers like length, tone, and punctuation.

TL;DR: 本文提出Disclaimer Injection方法，通过在文本中注入对齐触发免责声明，使大语言模型无法有效学习该数据，从而在黑盒场景下实现数据保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模异构文本训练引发对专有或个人数据未经授权使用的担忧，需在现实黑盒设置下防范模型对敏感数据的意外学习。

Method: Disclaimer Injection：在原始文本中注入精心设计的、能触发模型对齐机制的免责声明，利用模型自身对齐层的持续激活来压制任务学习能力。

Result: 在受保护数据上微调会导致对齐相关层持续激活，使对齐约束压倒任务学习，模型在常规输入上也出现显著且系统性的性能下降。

Conclusion: 对齐行为可作为数据保护的新杠杆；Disclaimer Injection是首个无需访问或修改训练流程即可在LLM规模上限制数据可学性的实用方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained on massive, heterogeneous text corpora, raising serious concerns about the unauthorised use of proprietary or personal data during model training. In this work, we address the problem of data protection against unwanted model learning in a realistic black-box setting. We propose Disclaimer Injection, a novel data-level defence that renders text unlearnable to LLMs. Rather than relying on model-side controls or explicit data removal, our approach exploits the models' own alignment mechanisms: by injecting carefully designed alignment-triggering disclaimers to prevent effective learning. Through layer-wise analysis, we find that fine-tuning on such protected data induces persistent activation of alignment-related layers, causing alignment constraints to override task learning even on common inputs. Consequently, models trained on such data exhibit substantial and systematic performance degradation compared to standard fine-tuning. Our results identify alignment behaviour as a previously unexplored lever for data protection and, to our knowledge, present the first practical method for restricting data learnability at LLM scale without requiring access to or modification of the training pipeline.

Abstract: We present a systematic formalization of Tigrinya cardinal and ordinal number verbalization, addressing a gap in computational resources for the language. This work documents the canonical rules governing the expression of numerical values in spoken Tigrinya, including the conjunction system, scale words, and special cases for dates, times, and currency. We provide a formal algorithm for number-to-word conversion and release an open-source implementation. Evaluation of frontier large language models (LLMs) reveals significant gaps in their ability to accurately verbalize Tigrinya numbers, underscoring the need for explicit rule documentation. This work serves language modeling, speech synthesis, and accessibility applications targeting Tigrinya-speaking communities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出LatentGraphMem，一种结合隐式图记忆与显式子图检索的记忆框架，旨在解决长上下文下证据稀疏分散的问题，提升大语言模型在长视野应用中的问答能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视野应用需要大语言模型在证据稀疏且分散于极长上下文时仍能准确回答问题，而现有显式结构化记忆易因长上下文过载而失效，隐式记忆虽稳定高效却难以检验。

Method: LatentGraphMem将图结构记忆存储于潜在空间以保证稳定性与效率，并提供任务特定的子图检索接口，在固定预算下返回紧凑的符号子图用于下游推理和人工检查；训练时显式构建图视图以对接冻结推理器进行监督；推理时仅在潜在空间中执行检索并外化所获子图。

Result: 在多个模型规模的长视野基准测试中，LatentGraphMem持续优于代表性显式图记忆和隐式记忆基线，同时支持参数高效适配及灵活扩展至更大推理器，且不引入大量符号化开销。

Conclusion: LatentGraphMem成功融合了显式可解释性与隐式稳定性，为长上下文、低证据密度场景下的大语言模型记忆系统提供了新范式。

Abstract: Long-horizon applications increasingly require large language models (LLMs) to answer queries when relevant evidence is sparse and dispersed across very long contexts. Existing memory systems largely follow two paradigms: explicit structured memories offer interpretability but often become brittle under long-context overload, while latent memory mechanisms are efficient and stable yet difficult to inspect. We propose LatentGraphMem, a memory framework that combines implicit graph memory with explicit subgraph retrieval. LatentGraphMem stores a graph-structured memory in latent space for stability and efficiency, and exposes a task-specific subgraph retrieval interface that returns a compact symbolic subgraph under a fixed budget for downstream reasoning and human inspection. During training, an explicit graph view is materialized to interface with a frozen reasoner for question-answering supervision. At inference time, retrieval is performed in latent space and only the retrieved subgraph is externalized. Experiments on long-horizon benchmarks across multiple model scales show that LatentGraphMem consistently outperforms representative explicit-graph and latent-memory baselines, while enabling parameter-efficient adaptation and flexible scaling to larger reasoners without introducing large symbolic artifacts.

TL;DR: 本文提出了PCoA，一个面向医疗领域的、带短语级上下文归因的方面级摘要专家标注基准，并设计了细粒度解耦评估框架，验证了其可靠性及对摘要质量提升的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统生成的摘要验证困难，尤其在高风险医疗领域，需精准归因到源上下文；现有方法缺乏细粒度的上下文支持证据标注。

Method: 构建专家标注的PCoA基准数据集，实现方面级摘要与支撑句及其中贡献性短语的对齐；提出解耦式评估框架，分别评估摘要质量、引用句子和贡献短语。

Result: PCoA数据集质量高、一致性好；实验表明显式识别支撑句和贡献短语可提升摘要整体质量；多个大语言模型在该基准上的表现得到系统评测。

Conclusion: PCoA为带短语级上下文归因的医疗摘要提供了可靠、细粒度的评估基准，推动可验证、可归因的医疗文本摘要研究。

Abstract: Verifying system-generated summaries remains challenging, as effective verification requires precise attribution to the source context, which is especially crucial in high-stakes medical domains. To address this challenge, we introduce PCoA, an expert-annotated benchmark for medical aspect-based summarization with phrase-level context attribution. PCoA aligns each aspect-based summary with its supporting contextual sentences and contributory phrases within them. We further propose a fine-grained, decoupled evaluation framework that independently assesses the quality of generated summaries, citations, and contributory phrases. Through extensive experiments, we validate the quality and consistency of the PCoA dataset and benchmark several large language models on the proposed task. Experimental results demonstrate that PCoA provides a reliable benchmark for evaluating system-generated summaries with phrase-level context attribution. Furthermore, comparative experiments show that explicitly identifying relevant sentences and contributory phrases before summarization can improve overall quality. The data and code are available at https://github.com/chubohao/PCoA.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需训练的跨架构代理调优方法（CAPT），利用已有临床模型来增强通用大语言模型在临床任务上的表现，无需重新训练，且支持不同词表，在多项临床任务上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 适应临床领域的语言模型通常需要昂贵的持续预训练和微调，每次新模型迭代成本高；亟需一种低成本、免训练的适配方法。

Method: 提出Cross-Architecture Proxy Tuning（CAPT），一种基于模型集成的免训练适配方法：利用已有临床模型作为‘代理’，通过对比解码（contrastive decoding）在推理时选择性注入临床信号，兼容不同词表的通用与临床模型。

Result: 在6个临床分类与文本生成任务上，CAPT以新一代通用模型+旧代临床模型组合，平均性能比UniTE高17.6%，比传统proxy tuning高41.4%；token级分析与医生案例验证其提升临床可操作语言、降低上下文错误、增强临床特异性。

Conclusion: CAPT是一种高效、免训练、跨架构的临床知识迁移范式，可在不牺牲通用模型推理能力与流畅性的前提下，显著提升其临床适用性。

Abstract: Adapting language models to the clinical domain through continued pretraining and fine-tuning requires costly retraining for each new model generation. We propose Cross-Architecture Proxy Tuning (CAPT), a model-ensembling approach that enables training-free adaptation of state-of-the-art general-domain models using existing clinical models. CAPT supports models with disjoint vocabularies, leveraging contrastive decoding to selectively inject clinically relevant signals while preserving the general-domain model's reasoning and fluency. On six clinical classification and text-generation tasks, CAPT with a new-generation general-domain model and an older-generation clinical model consistently outperforms both models individually and state-of-the-art ensembling approaches (average +17.6% over UniTE, +41.4% over proxy tuning across tasks). Through token-level analysis and physician case studies, we demonstrate that CAPT amplifies clinically actionable language, reduces context errors, and increases clinical specificity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了ASPECTSIM框架，通过显式指定方面来衡量文档相似性，显著提升了人机一致性，并发现小开源模型在该任务上仍落后于大模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统文档相似性度量采用整体方法，忽略了具体方面的影响，而实际应用中往往需要基于特定方面进行相似性判断，因此需引入显式的方面条件化机制。

Method: 提出ASPECTSIM框架，构建包含26K方面-文档对的新基准；采用GPT-4o直接提示及16个开源LLM和9个嵌入模型进行大规模元评估，并设计两阶段优化提升小模型表现。

Result: GPT-4o直接提示实现约80%更高的人机一致性；小开源LLM经两阶段优化后人机一致性提升约140%，但仍显著低于GPT-4o。

Conclusion: 显式建模方面对文档相似性至关重要，当前标准实践需更新；尽管优化有效，小开源模型在方面条件化相似性建模上仍明显落后于大模型。

Abstract: We introduce ASPECTSIM, a simple and interpretable framework that requires conditioning document similarity on an explicitly specified aspect, which is different from the traditional holistic approach in measuring document similarity. Experimenting with a newly constructed benchmark of 26K aspect-document pairs, we found that ASPECTSIM, when implemented with direct GPT-4o prompting, achieves substantially higher human-machine agreement ($\approx$80% higher) than the same for holistic similarity without explicit aspects. These findings underscore the importance of explicitly accounting for aspects when measuring document similarity and highlight the need to revise standard practice. Next, we conducted a large-scale meta-evaluation using 16 smaller open-source LLMs and 9 embedding models with a focus on making ASPECTSIM accessible and reproducible. While directly prompting LLMs to produce ASPECTSIM scores turned out be ineffective (20-30% human-machine agreement), a simple two-stage refinement improved their agreement by $\approx$140%. Nevertheless, agreement remains well below that of GPT-4o-based models, indicating that smaller open-source LLMs still lag behind large proprietary models in capturing aspect-conditioned similarity.

TL;DR: 本文研究了大语言模型（LLM）作为自动评估者时，评分量表对人类与LLM评判一致性的影响；发现0-5分量表在多个基准任务中实现最强的人类-LLM对齐，并强调量表设计与子组诊断的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM被广泛用作自动评估者，但其在提示变化下的不一致性已被关注，而评分量表本身的影响尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过在三种评分量表和六个涵盖客观、开放主观及混合任务的基准上，收集人类与LLM的评分，并使用组内相关系数（ICC）衡量绝对一致性。

Result: LLM在主观任务中跨量表一致性不完美；量表选择显著影响人类-LLM一致性；0-5分量表整体对齐最优；聚合可靠性可能掩盖基准异质性，且存在按性别划分的系统性对齐差异。

Conclusion: 评分量表设计和细粒度子组诊断是构建可靠LLM-as-a-judge协议的关键要素。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated evaluators, yet prior works demonstrate that these LLM judges often lack consistency in scoring when the prompt is altered. However, the effect of the grading scale itself remains underexplored. We study the LLM-as-a-judge problem by comparing two kinds of raters: humans and LLMs. We collect ratings from both groups on three scales and across six benchmarks that include objective, open-ended subjective, and mixed tasks. Using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) to measure absolute agreement, we find that LLM judgments are not perfectly consistent across scales on subjective benchmarks, and that the choice of scale substantially shifts human-LLM agreement, even when within-group panel reliability is high. Aggregated over tasks, the grading scale of 0-5 yields the strongest human-LLM alignment. We further demonstrate that pooled reliability can mask benchmark heterogeneity and reveal systematic subgroup differences in alignment across gender groups, strengthening the importance of scale design and sub-level diagnostics as essential components of LLM-as-a-judge protocols.

TL;DR: 本文提出L2T预训练框架，在标准语言模型预训练中引入类人语言学习任务，以提升语言能力而不损害推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型虽能通过自回归预训练学习世界知识和推理能力，但未显式优化语言学能力（如语法、句法等），需弥补这一缺陷。

Method: 提出L2T（Language-to-Task）预训练框架，将原始文本转化为结构化输入-输出对，融入多种语言学习任务，并与标准next-token预测联合预训练。

Result: 在语言能力基准测试上性能提升且习得加速，同时在通用推理任务上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 将显式语言学习任务纳入预训练可有效增强语言模型的语言学能力，且不牺牲其推理能力，为更均衡的模型能力发展提供新路径。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are pre-trained on raw text datasets to generate text sequences token-by-token. While this approach facilitates the learning of world knowledge and reasoning, it does not explicitly optimize for linguistic competence. To bridge this gap, we propose L2T, a pre-training framework integrating Language Learning Tasks alongside standard next-token prediction. Inspired by human language acquisition, L2T transforms raw text into structured input-output pairs to provide explicit linguistic stimulation. Pre-training LMs on a mixture of raw text and L2T data not only improves overall performance on linguistic competence benchmarks but accelerates its acquisition, while maintaining competitive performance on general reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: 本文揭示了基于提示的评估低估了大语言模型（LLMs）对时间序列的理解能力；通过在线性探针上直接利用其内部表征，性能显著提升，表明LLM本身具备时序结构表征能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于提示的时间序列分类评估显示LLM表现差，引发对其是否编码有意义时序结构的质疑；作者旨在检验该结论是源于提示方法局限，还是模型本身缺乏时序表征能力。

Method: 对比零样本提示输出与在同一内部表征上训练的线性探针的性能；进行层级分析以定位时序判别信息在Transformer中的分布，并考察视觉/多模态输入的影响。

Result: 线性探针将平均F1从0.15–0.26大幅提升至0.61–0.67，常超越专用时序模型；判别性时序信息在早期Transformer层即出现，并被视觉/多模态输入增强。

Conclusion: 当前提示式评估与LLM实际表征能力存在系统性错配，导致严重低估其时间序列理解能力；LLM内部已蕴含丰富的、可用于分类的时序结构信息。

Abstract: Prompt-based evaluations suggest that large language models (LLMs) perform poorly on time series classification, raising doubts about whether they encode meaningful temporal structure. We show that this conclusion reflects limitations of prompt-based generation rather than the model's representational capacity by directly comparing prompt outputs with linear probes over the same internal representations. While zero-shot prompting performs near chance, linear probes improve average F1 from 0.15-0.26 to 0.61-0.67, often matching or exceeding specialized time series models. Layer-wise analyses further show that class-discriminative time series information emerges in early transformer layers and is amplified by visual and multimodal inputs. Together, these results demonstrate a systematic mismatch between what LLMs internally represent and what prompt-based evaluation reveals, leading current evaluations to underestimate their time series understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学问答基准主要关注临床知识或个体层面推理，缺乏对证据驱动的流行病学推断的系统性评估。

Method: 构建了EpiQAL基准，包含三个基于开放文献的子集，分别测试文本依据的事实回忆、结合文献证据与流行病学原理的多步推理、以及缺失讨论部分的结论重构；采用专家设计分类法、多模型验证和检索控制难度。

Result: 十种开源大模型在EpiQAL上表现普遍有限，多步推理最难；模型排名因子集而异，模型规模不能单独预测性能；思维链提示对多步推理有帮助，但在其他任务中效果不一。

Conclusion: EpiQAL为评估大模型在证据 grounding、推理能力和结论重建三方面提供了细粒度诊断信号，揭示当前LLMs在流行病学推理上的关键短板。

Abstract: Reliable epidemiological reasoning requires synthesizing study evidence to infer disease burden, transmission dynamics, and intervention effects at the population level. Existing medical question answering benchmarks primarily emphasize clinical knowledge or patient-level reasoning, yet few systematically evaluate evidence-grounded epidemiological inference. We present EpiQAL, the first diagnostic benchmark for epidemiological question answering across diverse diseases, comprising three subsets built from open-access literature. The subsets respectively evaluate text-grounded factual recall, multi-step inference linking document evidence with epidemiological principles, and conclusion reconstruction with the Discussion section withheld. Construction combines expert-designed taxonomy guidance, multi-model verification, and retrieval-based difficulty control. Experiments on ten open models reveal that current LLMs show limited performance on epidemiological reasoning, with multi-step inference posing the greatest challenge. Model rankings shift across subsets, and scale alone does not predict success. Chain-of-Thought prompting benefits multi-step inference but yields mixed results elsewhere. EpiQAL provides fine-grained diagnostic signals for evidence grounding, inferential reasoning, and conclusion reconstruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有仇恨言论检测模型过度依赖表层词汇特征，易受虚假相关干扰，鲁棒性、文化语境化和可解释性不足。

Method: 提出Supervised Moral Rationale Attention（SMRA），将道德基础理论指导下的专家标注token级道德理由作为注意力对齐的监督信号，端到端融入训练目标；构建新数据集HateBRMoralXplain，含仇恨标签、道德类别、token级道德理由及社会政治元数据。

Result: 在二分类仇恨检测和多标签道德情感分类任务上F1分别提升0.9和1.5；解释忠实度显著提高（IoU F1 +7.4pp，Token F1 +5.0pp）；解释更简洁且充分性提升（+2.3pp），公平性保持稳定。

Conclusion: SMRA通过将道德理由显式引入注意力监督，实现了更鲁棒、可解释、文化适配的仇恨言论检测，无需牺牲性能或公平性。

Abstract: Hate speech detection models rely on surface-level lexical features, increasing vulnerability to spurious correlations and limiting robustness, cultural contextualization, and interpretability. We propose Supervised Moral Rationale Attention (SMRA), the first self-explaining hate speech detection framework to incorporate moral rationales as direct supervision for attention alignment. Based on Moral Foundations Theory, SMRA aligns token-level attention with expert-annotated moral rationales, guiding models to attend to morally salient spans rather than spurious lexical patterns. Unlike prior rationale-supervised or post-hoc approaches, SMRA integrates moral rationale supervision directly into the training objective, producing inherently interpretable and contextualized explanations. To support our framework, we also introduce HateBRMoralXplain, a Brazilian Portuguese benchmark dataset annotated with hate labels, moral categories, token-level moral rationales, and socio-political metadata. Across binary hate speech detection and multi-label moral sentiment classification, SMRA consistently improves performance (e.g., +0.9 and +1.5 F1, respectively) while substantially enhancing explanation faithfulness, increasing IoU F1 (+7.4 pp) and Token F1 (+5.0 pp). Although explanations become more concise, sufficiency improves (+2.3 pp) and fairness remains stable, indicating more faithful rationales without performance or bias trade-offs

Motivation: 现有方法将文化视为静态背景知识，忽视其动态演化特性，导致在需要真实文化敏感性的下游任务中可靠性不足。

Method: CALM框架通过对比学习解耦任务语义与显式/隐式文化要素，形成结构化文化簇；利用跨注意力对齐文化特征，并通过Mixture-of-Experts沿文化特异性维度自适应融合；最后结合原始知识构建文化扎根的内部身份状态，并借助自提示反思学习实现持续适应与自我修正。

Result: 在多个跨文化基准数据集上的实验表明，CALM持续优于当前最先进方法。

Conclusion: CALM有效提升了语言模型对动态文化语境的理解与适应能力，为构建具备文化自省能力的语言模型提供了新范式。

Abstract: Cultural awareness in language models is the capacity to understand and adapt to diverse cultural contexts. However, most existing approaches treat culture as static background knowledge, overlooking its dynamic and evolving nature. This limitation reduces their reliability in downstream tasks that demand genuine cultural sensitivity. In this work, we introduce CALM, a novel framework designed to endow language models with cultural self-awareness. CALM disentangles task semantics from explicit cultural concepts and latent cultural signals, shaping them into structured cultural clusters through contrastive learning. These clusters are then aligned via cross-attention to establish fine-grained interactions among related cultural features and are adaptively integrated through a Mixture-of-Experts mechanism along culture-specific dimensions. The resulting unified representation is fused with the model's original knowledge to construct a culturally grounded internal identity state, which is further enhanced through self-prompted reflective learning, enabling continual adaptation and self-correction. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple cross-cultural benchmark datasets demonstrate that CALM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

*Jinming Nian,Zhiyuan Peng,Hongwei Shang,Dae Hoon Park,Yi Fang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于子模函数的评估子集选择方法SESS，用于提升自动提示优化的效果，相比随机或启发式方法，在多个基准数据集上取得了更优结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动提示优化依赖于小规模评估子集的性能反馈，但该子集的选择常被忽视，缺乏系统性研究。

Method: 提出SESS方法，将评估子集选择建模为最大化一个单调子模目标函数，并采用贪心算法进行选择，具备理论保证。

Result: 在GSM8K、MATH和GPQA-Diamond数据集上，SESS选出的子集优化出的提示优于随机或启发式基线。

Conclusion: 子模函数驱动的评估子集选择是一种有效且有理论支撑的策略，可显著提升自动提示优化性能。

Abstract: Automatic prompt optimization reduces manual prompt engineering, but relies on task performance measured on a small, often randomly sampled evaluation subset as its main source of feedback signal. Despite this, how to select that evaluation subset is usually treated as an implementation detail. We study evaluation subset selection for prompt optimization from a principled perspective and propose SESS, a submodular evaluation subset selection method. We frame selection as maximizing an objective set function and show that, under mild conditions, it is monotone and submodular, enabling greedy selection with theoretical guarantees. Across GSM8K, MATH, and GPQA-Diamond, submodularly selected evaluation subsets can yield better optimized prompts than random or heuristic baselines.

### [104] [Beyond Perplexity: A Lightweight Benchmark for Knowledge Retention in Supervised Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03505)
*Soheil Zibakhsh Shabgahi,Pedram Aghazadeh,Farinaz Koushanfar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为知识保留测试（KR-Test）的新评估框架，用于在监督微调（SFT）过程中区分语言风格模仿与真实事实性知识内化，无需指令调优或生成解码，通过对比样例衡量模型对正确与错误续写的概率偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证困惑度（perplexity）作为SFT监控指标的局限性——它无法区分模型是学会了事实知识还是仅模仿了文本风格。

Method: 设计轻量级、语料库驱动的KR-Test：基于自动构建的对比样例，评估模型对正确/错误事实续写的似然偏好；采用‘盲模型vs.先验模型’基线验证其有效性；并应用于LoRA微调过程的动力学分析。

Result: KR-Test能有效揭示语言能力收敛与知识保留之间的细粒度解耦现象，显著提升微调过程的可解释性；实验证明其在诊断LoRA训练动态方面具有实用价值。

Conclusion: KR-Test是一种可靠、高效且无需额外训练的评估工具，为LLM监督微调提供了更精准的知识学习监测手段，推动面向事实一致性的模型优化。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is a standard approach for injecting domain knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs). However, relying on validation perplexity to monitor training is often insufficient, as it confounds stylistic mimicry with genuine factual internalization. To address this, we introduce the Knowledge Retention (KR) Test , a lightweight, corpus-grounded evaluation framework designed to distinguish factual learning from linguistics. KR-Test utilizes automatically generated contrastive examples to measure likelihood preferences for correct versus incorrect continuations, requiring no instruction tuning or generative decoding. We validate the framework's integrity through a "blind vs. oracle" baseline analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrate the diagnostic capabilities of KR-Test by analyzing the training dynamics of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). By exposing the fine-grained dissociation between linguistic convergence and knowledge retention, KR-Test enhances the interpretability of fine-tuning dynamics.

### [105] [Reasoning Pattern Alignment Merging for Adaptive Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03506)
*Zhaofeng Zhong,Wei Yuan,Tong Chen,Xiangyu Zhao,Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen,Hongzhi Yin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出一种无需重新训练的轻量级模型融合方法RPAM，通过将长链式推理模型与短链式指令模型融合，实现查询自适应推理，在保持性能的同时显著降低推理开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型推理模型对所有查询均生成长推理路径，导致计算和延迟浪费；而加速方法往往依赖昂贵重训练或对提示敏感。

Method: 提出Reasoning Pattern Alignment Merging（RPAM），基于特征对齐的层级别模型融合框架：构建小规模模式标注校准集，为每条查询分配合适推理模式，并通过中间表征对齐与对比学习优化层融合系数。

Result: 在七个主流推理基准上实验表明，RPAM显著降低推理成本，同时维持强推理性能。

Conclusion: 模型融合是一种高效、免训练、数据友好的推理加速新范式，RPAM为实现查询自适应推理提供了实用可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent large reasoning models (LRMs) have made substantial progress in complex reasoning tasks, yet they often generate lengthy reasoning paths for every query, incurring unnecessary computation and latency. Existing speed-up approaches typically rely on retraining the model or designing sophisticated prompting, which are either prohibitively expensive or highly sensitive to the input and prompt formulation. In this work, we study model merging as a lightweight alternative for efficient reasoning: by combining a long chain-of-thought (Long-CoT) reasoning model with a Short-CoT instruction model, we obtain an adaptive reasoner without training from scratch or requiring large-scale additional data. Building on this idea, we propose Reasoning Pattern Alignment Merging (RPAM), a layer-wise model merging framework based on feature alignment to facilitate query-adaptive reasoning. RPAM first constructs a small pattern-labeled calibration set that assigns each query an appropriate reasoning pattern. It then optimizes layer-wise merging coefficients by aligning the merged model's intermediate representations with those of the selected model, while a contrastive objective explicitly pushes them away from the non-selected model. Experiments on seven widely used reasoning benchmarks show that RPAM substantially reduces inference cost while maintaining strong performance. Upon article acceptance, we will provide open-source code to reproduce experiments for RPAM.

*Hossein Hosseini Kasnavieh,Gholamreza Haffari,Chris Leckie,Adel N. Toosi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IntroLM 提出了一种让大语言模型在预填充阶段自我评估输出质量的新方法，通过引入仅对内省标记激活的条件LoRA，无需外部分类器，在保持原模型行为的同时显著提升预测准确率与系统效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM输出质量预测方法依赖外部分类器（如BERT），存在上下文窗口小、表征能力有限及额外计算开销等问题。

Method: 提出IntroLM，利用内省token和token条件LoRA，在prefill阶段让因果语言模型自评输出质量，不干扰正常生成过程。

Result: 在问答基准上，IntroLM应用于Qwen3-8B达到90% ROC AUC，比DeBERTa高14%；在多模型路由中，延迟降低33%，大模型使用减少50%，同时保持可靠性。

Conclusion: IntroLM是一种高效、轻量且无需外部评估器的LLM自省质量预测方法，可显著提升推理系统的成本-性能权衡。

Abstract: A major challenge for the operation of large language models (LLMs) is how to predict whether a specific LLM will produce sufficiently high-quality output for a given query. Existing approaches rely on external classifiers, most commonly BERT based models, which suffer from limited context windows, constrained representational capacity, and additional computational overhead. We propose IntroLM, a method that enables causal language models to predict their own output quality during the prefilling phase without affecting generation using introspective tokens. By introducing token conditional LoRA that activates only for the introspective token, the model learns to predict the output quality for a given query while preserving the original backbone behavior and avoiding external evaluators. On question answering benchmarks, IntroLM applied to Qwen3 8B achieves a ROC AUC of 90 precent for success prediction, outperforming a DeBERTa classifier by 14 precent. When integrated into multi model routing systems, IntroLM achieves superior cost performance tradeoffs, reducing latency by up to 33 precent and large model usage by up to 50 precent at matched reliability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了Mem-Gallery基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLM）在长时对话中的多模态长期记忆能力，并构建了涵盖记忆提取与适应、记忆推理、记忆知识管理三方面的能力评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准无法有效评估MLLM在长时多模态对话中对视觉与文本信息的长期记忆保持、组织与演化能力。

Method: 构建了高质量、多会话、多模态（图文）的Mem-Gallery基准数据集，并提出覆盖记忆提取与测试时适配、记忆推理、记忆知识管理三个维度的系统性评估框架。

Result: 在13个记忆系统上的广泛评测揭示：显式保留和组织多模态信息至关重要；记忆推理与知识管理能力仍严重不足；当前模型存在效率瓶颈。

Conclusion: Mem-Gallery填补了多模态长期对话记忆评估的空白，为推动MLLM长期记忆能力发展提供了新标准与诊断工具。

Abstract: Long-term memory is a critical capability for multimodal large language model (MLLM) agents, particularly in conversational settings where information accumulates and evolves over time. However, existing benchmarks either evaluate multi-session memory in text-only conversations or assess multimodal understanding within localized contexts, failing to evaluate how multimodal memory is preserved, organized, and evolved across long-term conversational trajectories. Thus, we introduce Mem-Gallery, a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal long-term conversational memory in MLLM agents. Mem-Gallery features high-quality multi-session conversations grounded in both visual and textual information, with long interaction horizons and rich multimodal dependencies. Building on this dataset, we propose a systematic evaluation framework that assesses key memory capabilities along three functional dimensions: memory extraction and test-time adaptation, memory reasoning, and memory knowledge management. Extensive benchmarking across thirteen memory systems reveals several key findings, highlighting the necessity of explicit multimodal information retention and memory organization, the persistent limitations in memory reasoning and knowledge management, as well as the efficiency bottleneck of current models.

*Yuwen Wang,Xinyuan Qian,Tian-Hao Zhang,Jiaran Gao,Yuchen Pan,Xin Wang,Zhou Pan,Chen Wei,Yiming Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出个性化大型音频语言模型（PALM）任务，旨在使模型能基于个人上下文进行理解和推理，并构建首个基准PALM-Bench以推动该方向发展。实验表明现有方法在建模个性化知识和跨任务迁移上仍存在明显局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型音频语言模型（LALMs）行为泛化性强但缺乏个性化能力，无法支持如‘总结我最好的朋友说了什么’这类依赖个人上下文的问题回答；而人类天然具备基于个人背景进行理解与决策的能力。

Method: 形式化定义个性化音频语言模型（PALM）任务，构建首个面向多说话人场景的基准PALM-Bench，涵盖多个子任务，并在主流开源LALMs上系统评估训练无关提示（prompting）与监督微调等策略的效果。

Result: 实验证明当前训练无关提示和监督微调方法虽有一定提升，但在建模个性化知识及跨任务鲁棒迁移方面仍显著受限；PALM-Bench为后续研究提供了结构化评测平台。

Conclusion: 个性化音频语言理解是重要且尚未被充分探索的方向；PALM任务与PALM-Bench为推动该领域发展提供了理论框架与实证基础。

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) have demonstrated strong performance in audio understanding and generation. Yet, our extensive benchmarking reveals that their behavior is largely generic (e.g., summarizing spoken content) and fails to adequately support personalized question answering (e.g., summarizing what my best friend says). In contrast, human conditions their interpretation and decision-making on each individual's personal context. To bridge this gap, we formalize the task of Personalized LALMs (PALM) for recognizing personal concepts and reasoning within personal context. Moreover, we create the first benchmark (PALM-Bench) to foster the methodological advances in PALM and enable structured evaluation on several tasks across multi-speaker scenarios. Our extensive experiments on representative open-source LALMs, show that existing training-free prompting and supervised fine-tuning strategies, while yield improvements, remains limited in modeling personalized knowledge and transferring them across tasks robustly. Data and code will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于感知的骑行适宜性评估方法难以充分刻画道路环境复杂性及骑行者主观感知的异质性。

Method: 提出 persona-aware 视觉-语言模型框架，包含：(i) 基于骑行者类型学的理论驱动画像条件化与思维链解释生成；(ii) 融合稀缺专家推理标注与大量用户评分的多粒度监督微调；(iii) 用于隔离基础设施变量影响的AI可控配对数据增强。

Result: 在12,400条来自427名骑行者的全景图像评估数据上实验表明，该框架在骑行适宜性评分预测上具竞争力，并能实现可解释的因素归因。

Conclusion: 所提框架有效兼顾预测准确性与可解释性，为个性化、可理解的城市骑行环境评估提供了新范式。

Abstract: Bikeability assessment is essential for advancing sustainable urban transportation and creating cyclist-friendly cities, and it requires incorporating users' perceptions of safety and comfort. Yet existing perception-based bikeability assessment approaches face key limitations in capturing the complexity of road environments and adequately accounting for heterogeneity in subjective user perceptions. This paper proposes a persona-aware Vision-Language Model framework for bikeability assessment with three novel contributions: (i) theory-grounded persona conditioning based on established cyclist typology that generates persona-specific explanations via chain-of-thought reasoning; (ii) multi-granularity supervised fine-tuning that combines scarce expert-annotated reasoning with abundant user ratings for joint prediction and explainable assessment; and (iii) AI-enabled data augmentation that creates controlled paired data to isolate infrastructure variable impacts. To test and validate this framework, we developed a panoramic image-based crowdsourcing system and collected 12,400 persona-conditioned assessments from 427 cyclists. Experiment results show that the proposed framework offers competitive bikeability rating prediction while uniquely enabling explainable factor attribution.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了DeepSynth-Eval基准，用于客观评估大语言模型在深度研究中信息整合能力，尤其聚焦于后检索阶段的长篇报告生成；通过反向构建“Oracle Contexts”与细粒度检查表（通用与约束）实现可验证评估；实验表明，基于规划-写作的智能体工作流显著优于单次生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM评估多集中于检索能力，而对后检索阶段——即从大量碎片化证据中合成连贯长篇报告——缺乏客观、可量化的评估方法，因其涉及主观性较强的开放写作。

Method: 构建DeepSynth-Eval基准：以高质量综述论文为黄金标准，反向生成研究请求，并从其参考文献中构造无噪声的'Oracle Contexts'；提出两类检查表——通用检查表（评估事实覆盖）与约束检查表（评估结构组织），将主观写作评价转化为可验证指标。

Result: 在96项任务上的实验表明：当前模型仍难以有效整合数百篇文献信息；采用agentic plan-and-write流程显著降低幻觉、提升对复杂结构约束的遵循能力。

Conclusion: 信息整合是LLM迈向深度研究智能体的关键瓶颈；DeepSynth-Eval为该能力提供了首个系统、客观、可复现的评估框架，并验证了分步规划式合成范式的有效性。

Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) towards autonomous agents has catalyzed progress in Deep Research. While retrieval capabilities are well-benchmarked, the post-retrieval synthesis stage--where agents must digest massive amounts of context and consolidate fragmented evidence into coherent, long-form reports--remains under-evaluated due to the subjectivity of open-ended writing. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepSynth-Eval, a benchmark designed to objectively evaluate information consolidation capabilities. We leverage high-quality survey papers as gold standards, reverse-engineering research requests and constructing "Oracle Contexts" from their bibliographies to isolate synthesis from retrieval noise. We propose a fine-grained evaluation protocol using General Checklists (for factual coverage) and Constraint Checklists (for structural organization), transforming subjective judgment into verifiable metrics. Experiments across 96 tasks reveal that synthesizing information from hundreds of references remains a significant challenge. Our results demonstrate that agentic plan-and-write workflows significantly outperform single-turn generation, effectively reducing hallucinations and improving adherence to complex structural constraints.

TL;DR: 本文挑战了多跳推理中‘跳对齐电路假说’，发现存在‘层序倒置’现象，并提出‘概率回忆-提取’框架来解释该现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多跳推理任务中表现良好，但其内部如何组合多个事实仍不明确。

Method: 通过系统分析真实世界多跳查询，提出并验证‘概率回忆-提取’框架，结合探针分析重新解释已有证据。

Result: 发现了‘层序倒置’现象——后跳答案实体可在桥接实体之前被解码，且该现象随总跳数增加而增强；新框架成功解释了思维链增益及多跳失败机制。

Conclusion: 多跳推理并非严格按跳数逐层进行，而是由浅层宽泛回忆与深层选择性提取协同完成；‘跳对齐’假设不具普适性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) perform well on multi-hop reasoning, yet how they internally compose multiple facts remains unclear. Recent work proposes \emph{hop-aligned circuit hypothesis}, suggesting that bridge entities are computed sequentially across layers before later-hop answers. Through systematic analyses on real-world multi-hop queries, we show that this hop-aligned assumption does not generalize: later-hop answer entities can become decodable earlier than bridge entities, a phenomenon we call \emph{layer-order inversion}, which strengthens with total hops. To explain this behavior, we propose a \emph{probabilistic recall-and-extract} framework that models multi-hop reasoning as broad probabilistic recall in shallow MLP layers followed by selective extraction in deeper attention layers. This framework is empirically validated through systematic probing analyses, reinterpreting prior layer-wise decoding evidence, explaining chain-of-thought gains, and providing a mechanistic diagnosis of multi-hop failures despite correct single-hop knowledge. Code is available at https://github.com/laquabe/Layer-Order-Inversion.

Motivation: 现有基准缺乏对大语言模型在多会话场景下多样化记忆维度的系统性评估。

Method: 提出EvolMem基准，结合认知心理学理论，设计涵盖陈述性与非陈述性记忆的细粒度能力评测；构建融合主题发起生成与叙事启发变换的混合数据合成框架，支持可控复杂度的多会话对话生成及样本级评估指南。

Result: 实验证明没有LLM能在所有记忆维度上持续优于其他模型；代理系统的记忆机制未显著提升LLM性能，且常伴随明显效率问题。

Conclusion: EvolMem为多会话记忆能力提供了更全面、可扩展的评估范式，揭示了当前LLM与代理系统在长期记忆建模上的关键局限。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in understanding and leveraging long-range conversational memory, existing benchmarks still lack systematic evaluation of large language models(LLMs) across diverse memory dimensions, particularly in multi-session settings. In this work, we propose EvolMem, a new benchmark for assessing multi-session memory capabilities of LLMs and agent systems. EvolMem is grounded in cognitive psychology and encompasses both declarative and non-declarative memory, further decomposed into multiple fine-grained abilities. To construct the benchmark, we introduce a hybrid data synthesis framework that consists of topic-initiated generation and narrative-inspired transformations. This framework enables scalable generation of multi-session conversations with controllable complexity, accompanied by sample-specific evaluation guidelines. Extensive evaluation reveals that no LLM consistently outperforms others across all memory dimensions. Moreover, agent memory mechanisms do not necessarily enhance LLMs' capabilities and often exhibit notable efficiency limitations. Data and code will be released at https://github.com/shenye7436/EvolMem.

*Guanyu Chen,Chenxiao Yu,Xiyang Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于上下文的评估协议，用于衡量大语言模型（LLMs）在个人数据共享决策中隐私态度、亲社会性与实际分享行为之间的价值-行动一致性，并引入了人类参照的VAAR指标进行量化分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法孤立测量隐私态度或分享意愿，难以反映模型价值观如何联合预测其实际数据共享行为，无法类比真实人类行为。

Method: 设计顺序式上下文评估协议（含隐私态度、亲社会性、数据分享接受度问卷），在带历史记录的会话中实施；采用多组结构方程模型（MGSEM）建模价值到行为的路径关系；提出人类参照的Value-Action Alignment Rate（VAAR）指标，聚合路径符号一致性证据。

Result: 在多个LLM上观察到稳定但模型特异的Privacy-PSA-AoDS行为轮廓，且价值-行动对齐程度存在显著异质性。

Conclusion: LLMs的价值表达与其行为之间存在非一致、模型依赖的对齐关系，需用上下文化、结构化、人类参照的评估框架来准确刻画其决策合理性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate decision-making tasks involving personal data sharing, where privacy concerns and prosocial motivations can push choices in opposite directions. Existing evaluations often measure privacy-related attitudes or sharing intentions in isolation, which makes it difficult to determine whether a model's expressed values jointly predict its downstream data-sharing actions as in real human behaviors. We introduce a context-based assessment protocol that sequentially administers standardized questionnaires for privacy attitudes, prosocialness, and acceptance of data sharing within a bounded, history-carrying session. To evaluate value-action alignments under competing attitudes, we use multi-group structural equation modeling (MGSEM) to identify relations from privacy concerns and prosocialness to data sharing. We propose Value-Action Alignment Rate (VAAR), a human-referenced directional agreement metric that aggregates path-level evidence for expected signs. Across multiple LLMs, we observe stable but model-specific Privacy-PSA-AoDS profiles, and substantial heterogeneity in value-action alignment.

TL;DR: 本文提出PAS（Police Action Scenarios）框架，用于系统评估大语言模型（LLMs）在警务场景中的可靠性，构建了基于8000+官方文档的新型问答数据集，并通过警界专家验证指标，发现商用LLM在事实性建议任务上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏针对警务场景定制的大语言模型评估框架，而LLM在执法中未经验证的使用可能导致非法逮捕、不当取证等严重后果。

Method: 提出PAS系统评估框架；基于8000余份官方警务文档构建新型QA数据集；设计并经警察专家统计验证的关键评估指标；对主流商用LLM进行实证评测。

Result: 商用大语言模型在警务相关任务（尤其是需事实依据的推荐任务）上表现较差；所提框架和数据集具备可扩展性与实用性；数据与提示模板已开源。

Conclusion: 亟需可扩展、面向实际执法需求的AI评估框架，以保障AI驱动警务操作的可靠性与合法性。

Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in police operations is growing, yet an evaluation framework tailored to police operations remains absent. While LLM's responses may not always be legally incorrect, their unverified use still can lead to severe issues such as unlawful arrests and improper evidence collection. To address this, we propose PAS (Police Action Scenarios), a systematic framework covering the entire evaluation process. Applying this framework, we constructed a novel QA dataset from over 8,000 official documents and established key metrics validated through statistical analysis with police expert judgements. Experimental results show that commercial LLMs struggle with our new police-related tasks, particularly in providing fact-based recommendations. This study highlights the necessity of an expandable evaluation framework to ensure reliable AI-driven police operations. We release our data and prompt template.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出DiffCoT，一种基于扩散模型思想的链式思维（CoT）推理框架，通过滑动窗口机制和因果扩散噪声调度，在保持自回归特性的前提下实现推理步骤的迭代去噪与回溯修正，显著提升多步数学推理的鲁棒性和纠错能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-Thought（CoT）推理易受暴露偏差和错误累积影响，早期错误在自回归解码中不可逆传播，限制其可靠性。

Method: 提出DiffCoT框架，将CoT推理建模为推理步骤级的迭代去噪过程；引入滑动窗口机制实现生成与回溯修正的统一；设计因果扩散噪声调度以保持推理链的时间因果一致性。

Result: 在三个多步CoT推理基准上，DiffCoT在多种大模型主干上均一致优于现有CoT偏好优化方法，展现出更强的鲁棒性与错误纠正能力。

Conclusion: DiffCoT为提升CoT推理的可靠性提供了新范式，验证了扩散建模思想在结构化推理任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves multi-step mathematical problem solving in large language models but remains vulnerable to exposure bias and error accumulation, as early mistakes propagate irreversibly through autoregressive decoding. In this work, we propose DiffCoT, a diffusion-styled CoT framework that reformulates CoT reasoning as an iterative denoising process. DiffCoT integrates diffusion principles at the reasoning-step level via a sliding-window mechanism, enabling unified generation and retrospective correction of intermediate steps while preserving token-level autoregression. To maintain causal consistency, we further introduce a causal diffusion noise schedule that respects the temporal structure of reasoning chains. Extensive experiments on three multi-step CoT reasoning benchmarks across diverse model backbones demonstrate that DiffCoT consistently outperforms existing CoT preference optimization methods, yielding improved robustness and error-correction capability in CoT reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大语言模型（LLMs）在持续预训练过程中概念的获取、保留与遗忘机制，通过识别与特定概念相关的‘概念电路’（Concept Circuits）并结合图度量分析其结构动态，揭示了概念学习的阶段性模式、干扰与协同效应以及可迁移性差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类主要通过概念理解世界，但LLMs如何在持续预训练中习得、保持和遗忘概念尚不清楚，亟需从机制层面理解其概念学习动态。

Method: 提出‘概念电路’作为与特定概念关联的计算子图，结合行为分析（概念获取/遗忘曲线、干扰/协同效应）与图度量刻画电路结构演化。

Result: 发现：(1) 概念电路能显著表征概念学习与遗忘；(2) 电路强度呈先升后降再稳定的阶段式演化；(3) 学习增益大的概念更易被后续训练遗忘；(4) 语义相似概念间干扰更强；(5) 概念间存在异质性迁移能力。

Conclusion: 概念电路为理解LLM概念学习提供了可解释的电路级视角，有助于设计更鲁棒、可解释的概念感知训练策略。

Abstract: Human beings primarily understand the world through concepts (e.g., dog), abstract mental representations that structure perception, reasoning, and learning. However, how large language models (LLMs) acquire, retain, and forget such concepts during continual pretraining remains poorly understood. In this work, we study how individual concepts are acquired and forgotten, as well as how multiple concepts interact through interference and synergy. We link these behavioral dynamics to LLMs' internal Concept Circuits, computational subgraphs associated with specific concepts, and incorporate Graph Metrics to characterize circuit structure. Our analysis reveals: (1) LLMs concept circuits provide a non-trivial, statistically significant signal of concept learning and forgetting; (2) Concept circuits exhibit a stage-wise temporal pattern during continual pretraining, with an early increase followed by gradual decrease and stabilization; (3) concepts with larger learning gains tend to exhibit greater forgetting under subsequent training; (4) semantically similar concepts induce stronger interference than weakly related ones; (5) conceptual knowledge differs in their transferability, with some significantly facilitating the learning of others. Together, our findings offer a circuit-level view of concept learning dynamics and inform the design of more interpretable and robust concept-aware training strategies for LLMs.

### [117] [PsychEthicsBench: Evaluating Large Language Models Against Australian Mental Health Ethics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03578)
*Yaling Shen,Stephanie Fong,Yiwen Jiang,Zimu Wang,Feilong Tang,Qingyang Xu,Xiangyu Zhao,Zhongxing Xu,Jiahe Liu,Jinpeng Hu,Dominic Dwyer,Zongyuan Ge*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出PsychEthicsBench，首个基于澳大利亚心理与精神科指南的伦理基准，用于评估大语言模型在心理健康场景中的伦理知识与行为响应，发现拒答率不能有效反映临床适宜性，且领域微调可能损害伦理鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有心理健康领域大语言模型的安全评估主要依赖拒答信号，但拒答本身可能缺乏共情、阻碍求助，无法反映临床所需的细微伦理行为，亟需更专业、原则驱动的评估框架。

Method: 构建PsychEthicsBench——首个依据澳大利亚心理学与精神病学指南设计的原则导向型基准，包含多选题与开放式任务，并提供细粒度伦理性标注；在14个模型上开展实证评估。

Result: 拒答率与实际伦理行为显著脱节；部分领域专用微调模型在伦理对齐上反低于其基础模型；PsychEthicsBench可支持司法管辖区感知的系统性评估。

Conclusion: 应摒弃单一拒答指标，转向基于专业伦理准则的多维评估；PsychEthicsBench为心理健康AI的安全、负责任发展提供了可扩展、可解释的评估基础。

Abstract: The increasing integration of large language models (LLMs) into mental health applications necessitates robust frameworks for evaluating professional safety alignment. Current evaluative approaches primarily rely on refusal-based safety signals, which offer limited insight into the nuanced behaviors required in clinical practice. In mental health, clinically inadequate refusals can be perceived as unempathetic and discourage help-seeking. To address this gap, we move beyond refusal-centric metrics and introduce \texttt{PsychEthicsBench}, the first principle-grounded benchmark based on Australian psychology and psychiatry guidelines, designed to evaluate LLMs' ethical knowledge and behavioral responses through multiple-choice and open-ended tasks with fine-grained ethicality annotations. Empirical results across 14 models reveal that refusal rates are poor indicators of ethical behavior, revealing a significant divergence between safety triggers and clinical appropriateness. Notably, we find that domain-specific fine-tuning can degrade ethical robustness, as several specialized models underperform their base backbones in ethical alignment. PsychEthicsBench provides a foundation for systematic, jurisdiction-aware evaluation of LLMs in mental health, encouraging more responsible development in this domain.

*Juhyun Oh,Haneul Yoo,Faiz Ghifari Haznitrama,Alice Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出OLA基准测试，评估大语言模型在韩英混用语境下输出语言对齐能力，发现现有模型存在非英语偏向、响应不稳定等问题，但通过代码切换感知的DPO微调可显著改善。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言用户自然地进行语码转换，但当前大语言模型难以根据上下文和语用线索准确推断并生成符合用户隐含期望的目标语言输出。

Method: 构建面向韩英语码转换的OLA基准；系统评测前沿模型在不同混用场景下的输出语言对齐表现；分析偏差泛化性与响应不稳定性；尝试思维链提示与代码转换感知的DPO微调方法。

Result: 前沿模型普遍存在非英语响应偏向，且该偏差在中英、印尼英组合中同样存在；模型响应易出现中途语言切换和语言侵入；思维链提示无效；仅用约1K样本的代码转换感知DPO可显著降低错配率。

Conclusion: 语码转换下的输出语言对齐问题源于训练对齐不足，而非模型本质局限；需在真实多语言交互中显式建模用户隐含语言期望。

Abstract: Code-switching, alternating between languages within a conversation, is natural for multilingual users, yet poses fundamental challenges for large language models (LLMs). When a user code-switches in their prompt to an LLM, they typically do not specify the expected language of the LLM response, and thus LLMs must infer the output language from contextual and pragmatic cues. We find that current LLMs systematically fail to align with this expectation, responding in undesired languages even when cues are clear to humans. We introduce OLA, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' Output Language Alignment in code-switched interactions. OLA focuses on Korean--English code-switching and spans simple intra-sentential mixing to instruction-content mismatches. Even frontier models frequently misinterpret implicit language expectation, exhibiting a bias toward non-English responses. We further show this bias generalizes beyond Korean to Chinese and Indonesian pairs. Models also show instability through mid-response switching and language intrusions. Chain-of-Thought prompting fails to resolve these errors, indicating weak pragmatic reasoning about output language. However, Code-Switching Aware DPO with minimal data (about 1K examples) substantially reduces misalignment, suggesting these failures stem from insufficient alignment rather than fundamental limitations. Our results highlight the need to align multilingual LLMs with users' implicit expectations in real-world code-switched interactions.

TL;DR: 本文提出Self-Graph Reasoning（SGR）框架，使大语言模型能在开放域问答中自主构建图结构化推理过程，提升逻辑一致性，在多个基准上显著超越基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有线性推理方法（如CoT）逻辑不一致，且缺乏让LLM自主构建和使用图结构推理的能力，尤其在开放域问答中存在空白。

Method: 提出Self-Graph Reasoning（SGR）框架，使LLM显式地将推理过程建模为结构化图；构建融合多候选图的图结构推理数据集用于训练。

Result: 在五个QA基准（涵盖通用与专业领域）上，SGR带来17.74%性能提升；微调后的LLaMA-3.3-70B表现媲美GPT-4o、超越Claude-3.5-Haiku。

Conclusion: 图结构化推理能有效增强LLM的逻辑一致性与推理能力，SGR为开放域问答提供了可扩展、自驱动的新型推理范式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong reasoning ability in open-domain question answering, yet their reasoning processes are typically linear and often logically inconsistent. In contrast, real-world reasoning requires integrating multiple premises and solving subproblems in parallel. Existing methods, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), express reasoning in a linear textual form, which may appear coherent but frequently leads to inconsistent conclusions. Recent approaches rely on externally provided graphs and do not explore how LLMs can construct and use their own graph-structured reasoning, particularly in open-domain QA. To fill this gap, we novelly explore graph-structured reasoning of LLMs in general-domain question answering. We propose Self-Graph Reasoning (SGR), a framework that enables LLMs to explicitly represent their reasoning process as a structured graph before producing the final answer. We further construct a graph-structured reasoning dataset that merges multiple candidate reasoning graphs into refined graph structures for model training. Experiments on five QA benchmarks across both general and specialized domains show that SGR consistently improves reasoning consistency and yields a 17.74% gain over the base model. The LLaMA-3.3-70B model fine-tuned with SGR performs comparably to GPT-4o and surpasses Claude-3.5-Haiku, demonstrating the effectiveness of graph-structured reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事实性验证方法多为二元判断，无法区分错误严重程度，限制了其在细粒度评估和偏好优化等场景中的应用。

Method: 提出Agentic Discriminative Verifier（DiVA）框架，融合生成式模型的代理式搜索能力与判别式模型的精细打分能力；同时构建细粒度事实性验证基准FGVeriBench。

Result: 在FGVeriBench上实验表明，DiVA在通用及多跳问题的事实性验证任务上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DiVA为事实性验证提供了更精细、更实用的解决方案，推动了LLM事实性评估向细粒度方向发展。

Abstract: Despite the significant advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs), their factuality remains a critical challenge, fueling growing interest in factuality verification. Existing research on factuality verification primarily conducts binary judgments (e.g., correct or incorrect), which fails to distinguish varying degrees of error severity. This limits its utility for applications such as fine-grained evaluation and preference optimization. To bridge this gap, we propose the Agentic Discriminative Verifier (DiVA), a hybrid framework that synergizes the agentic search capabilities of generative models with the precise scoring aptitude of discriminative models. We also construct a new benchmark, FGVeriBench, as a robust testbed for fine-grained factuality verification. Experimental results on FGVeriBench demonstrate that our DiVA significantly outperforms existing methods on factuality verification for both general and multi-hop questions.

### [121] [Analyzing Reasoning Shifts in Audio Deepfake Detection under Adversarial Attacks: The Reasoning Tax versus Shield Bifurcation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03615)
*Binh Nguyen,Thai Le*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于评估音频语言模型（ALMs）在对抗攻击下推理鲁棒性的法医审计框架，从声学感知、认知一致性与认知失调三个维度分析，发现推理既可作为防御‘盾牌’，也可能带来性能‘税’，并指出高认知失调可作为无声警报。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频深度伪造检测（ADD）多为黑箱分类器，缺乏可解释性；而新兴的音频语言模型（ALMs）虽引入推理路径以提升可解释性，但其推理过程在对抗攻击下的鲁棒性尚无系统评估，亟需新范式。

Method: 提出一种三维度法医审计框架：1）声学感知（模型对原始音频特征的敏感性）；2）认知一致性（推理链与输入/输出逻辑是否自洽）；3）认知失调（推理结论与分类结果矛盾程度）；并在多种对抗攻击（尤其语言类攻击）下进行系统评测。

Result: 发现ALMs的推理鲁棒性呈现两极分化：声学感知强的模型中推理起保护作用（shield），弱者则因推理引入额外脆弱性（tax），尤其在降低认知一致性时提升攻击成功率；且即使分类失败，高认知失调仍可有效预警伪造。

Conclusion: 显式推理不必然提升ALMs的鲁棒性，其作用高度依赖底层声学建模能力；认知失调可作为新型检测指标，该研究为可解释音频伪造检测的可靠性与安全性提供了关键洞见。

Abstract: Audio Language Models (ALMs) offer a promising shift towards explainable audio deepfake detections (ADDs), moving beyond \textit{black-box} classifiers by providing some level of transparency into their predictions via reasoning traces. This necessitates a new class of model robustness analysis: robustness of the predictive reasoning under adversarial attacks, which goes beyond existing paradigm that mainly focuses on the shifts of the final predictions (e.g., fake v.s. real). To analyze such reasoning shifts, we introduce a forensic auditing framework to evaluate the robustness of ALMs' reasoning under adversarial attacks in three inter-connected dimensions: acoustic perception, cognitive coherence, and cognitive dissonance. Our systematic analysis reveals that explicit reasoning does not universally enhance robustness. Instead, we observe a bifurcation: for models exhibiting robust acoustic perception, reasoning acts as a defensive \textit{``shield''}, protecting them from adversarial attacks. However, for others, it imposes a performance \textit{``tax''}, particularly under linguistic attacks which reduce cognitive coherence and increase attack success rate. Crucially, even when classification fails, high cognitive dissonance can serve as a \textit{silent alarm}, flagging potential manipulation. Overall, this work provides a critical evaluation of the role of reasoning in forensic audio deepfake analysis and its vulnerabilities.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了EPAG基准数据集和评估框架，用于评估大语言模型（LLM）在临床问诊前的预咨询能力，通过直接（HPI-指南对比）和间接（疾病诊断）方式评测，并发现小规模开源模型经特定微调后可超越前沿大模型，且HPI信息量与诊断性能无正相关，语言风格亦影响对话特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在真实临床预咨询场景中的能力缺乏系统性、标准化的评估方法，亟需面向诊断指南的专用基准。

Method: 构建EPAG基准数据集与评估框架，结合HPI与临床诊断指南的直接比对及疾病诊断任务的间接评估，并开展多维度实验（模型规模、HPI长度、语言风格等）。

Result: 小规模开源模型经任务特化微调后在预咨询任务上优于前沿大模型；HPI信息量增加并不提升诊断性能；预咨询语言风格显著影响对话特性。

Conclusion: EPAG为临床预咨询能力提供了可靠评估工具，揭示了模型性能不单取决于规模，更依赖于数据质量与任务适配性，开源资源有助于推动LLM在真实医疗场景中的落地。

Abstract: We introduce EPAG, a benchmark dataset and framework designed for Evaluating the Pre-consultation Ability of LLMs using diagnostic Guidelines. LLMs are evaluated directly through HPI-diagnostic guideline comparison and indirectly through disease diagnosis. In our experiments, we observe that small open-source models fine-tuned with a well-curated, task-specific dataset can outperform frontier LLMs in pre-consultation. Additionally, we find that increased amount of HPI (History of Present Illness) does not necessarily lead to improved diagnostic performance. Further experiments reveal that the language of pre-consultation influences the characteristics of the dialogue. By open-sourcing our dataset and evaluation pipeline on https://github.com/seemdog/EPAG, we aim to contribute to the evaluation and further development of LLM applications in real-world clinical settings.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统比较了大型推理模型（LRMs）与非推理大语言模型（LLMs）作为评估者的表现，发现LRMs在判断准确性、指令遵循和抗对抗攻击方面更优，但在表层质量上仍存在强偏差；为此提出简单有效的PlanJudge策略，通过让模型先生成评估计划再执行，显著缓解了偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大型推理模型（LRMs）是否比非推理大语言模型更适合作为评估者，填补该方向系统性比较的空白。

Method: 开展实证分析，对比LRMs与非推理LLMs在判断准确性、指令遵循能力及抗对抗攻击鲁棒性等方面的性能，并提出PlanJudge评估策略——即要求模型先显式生成评估计划再执行。

Result: 1) LRMs在推理密集型任务中判断准确率更高；2) 指令遵循能力更强；3) 对抗攻击鲁棒性更好；4) 但在表层质量上仍有显著偏差；PlanJudge能有效缓解该偏差。

Conclusion: LRMs作为评估者整体更优，但存在固有偏差；PlanJudge是一种简单而有效的偏差缓解方法，适用于LRMs和标准LLMs。

Abstract: This paper presents the first systematic comparison investigating whether Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are superior judge to non-reasoning LLMs. Our empirical analysis yields four key findings: 1) LRMs outperform non-reasoning LLMs in terms of judgment accuracy, particularly on reasoning-intensive tasks; 2) LRMs demonstrate superior instruction-following capabilities in evaluation contexts; 3) LRMs exhibit enhanced robustness against adversarial attacks targeting judgment tasks; 4) However, LRMs still exhibit strong biases in superficial quality. To improve the robustness against biases, we propose PlanJudge, an evaluation strategy that prompts the model to generate an explicit evaluation plan before execution. Despite its simplicity, our experiments demonstrate that PlanJudge significantly mitigates biases in both LRMs and standard LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体在持续学习新任务时面临稳定性-可塑性困境，根源在于未能显式区分跨任务共享知识与任务间冲突知识。

Method: 提出基于方向一致性评估的参数融合框架Agent-Dice，包含两阶段：几何共识过滤剔除冲突梯度，曲率重要性加权增强共享语义，并提供理论分析。

Result: 在GUI智能体和工具使用智能体领域实验表明，Agent-Dice持续学习性能优异，计算开销和参数更新量极小。

Conclusion: 显式解耦共享知识与冲突知识可有效缓解稳定性-可塑性困境；Agent-Dice为LLM智能体持续学习提供了高效、理论可解释的参数融合新范式。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents significantly extend the utility of LLMs by interacting with dynamic environments. However, enabling agents to continually learn new tasks without catastrophic forgetting remains a critical challenge, known as the stability-plasticity dilemma. In this work, we argue that this dilemma fundamentally arises from the failure to explicitly distinguish between common knowledge shared across tasks and conflicting knowledge introduced by task-specific interference. To address this, we propose Agent-Dice, a parameter fusion framework based on directional consensus evaluation. Concretely, Agent-Dice disentangles knowledge updates through a two-stage process: geometric consensus filtering to prune conflicting gradients, and curvature-based importance weighting to amplify shared semantics. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis that establishes the validity of the proposed fusion scheme and offers insight into the origins of the stability-plasticity dilemma. Extensive experiments on GUI agents and tool-use agent domains demonstrate that Agent-Dice exhibits outstanding continual learning performance with minimal computational overhead and parameter updates.

Motivation: 现有文本情感推断方法多将情感视为确定性点估计，无法刻画主观性、潜在模糊性及对话中情绪的时序耦合特性。

Method: 提出LLM-MC-Affect：基于随机LLM解码和蒙特卡洛估计，在情感空间上建模连续潜在概率分布；通过序列互相关与斜率指标分析对话双方情绪轨迹的耦合关系（如引领/滞后）。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解人际情绪协调提供了可扩展、可部署的通用方案，适用于教育以外更广泛的社会与行为科学研究。

Abstract: Emotional coordination is a core property of human interaction that shapes how relational meaning is constructed in real time. While text-based affect inference has become increasingly feasible, prior approaches often treat sentiment as a deterministic point estimate for individual speakers, failing to capture the inherent subjectivity, latent ambiguity, and sequential coupling found in mutual exchanges. We introduce LLM-MC-Affect, a probabilistic framework that characterizes emotion not as a static label, but as a continuous latent probability distribution defined over an affective space. By leveraging stochastic LLM decoding and Monte Carlo estimation, the methodology approximates these distributions to derive high-fidelity sentiment trajectories that explicitly quantify both central affective tendencies and perceptual ambiguity. These trajectories enable a structured analysis of interpersonal coupling through sequential cross-correlation and slope-based indicators, identifying leading or lagging influences between interlocutors. To validate the interpretive capacity of this approach, we utilize teacher-student instructional dialogues as a representative case study, where our quantitative indicators successfully distill high-level interaction insights such as effective scaffolding. This work establishes a scalable and deployable pathway for understanding interpersonal dynamics, offering a generalizable solution that extends beyond education to broader social and behavioral research.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效的层特定优化（ELO）方法，用于在多语言大语言模型中进行特定语言的持续预训练，显著降低计算成本并防止源语言性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统持续预训练在多语言大语言模型中计算开销高、源语言性能退化的问题。

Method: ELO方法包含两个阶段：(1) ELO预训练：仅选择并训练对目标语言最关键的第一层和最后一层；(2) 层对齐：将训练好的层重新整合进原模型，并用小数据集进行简短全量微调以对齐参数。

Result: 实验表明ELO方法相比现有方法训练速度提升最高达6.46倍，目标语言性能提升最高达6.2%，同时有效保持英语等源语言能力。

Conclusion: ELO是一种高效、低资源消耗且能兼顾多语言能力的持续预训练优化策略。

Abstract: We propose an efficient layer-specific optimization (ELO) method designed to enhance continual pretraining (CP) for specific languages in multilingual large language models (MLLMs). This approach addresses the common challenges of high computational cost and degradation of source language performance associated with traditional CP. The ELO method consists of two main stages: (1) ELO Pretraining, where a small subset of specific layers, identified in our experiments as the critically important first and last layers, are detached from the original MLLM and trained with the target language. This significantly reduces not only the number of trainable parameters but also the total parameters computed during the forward pass, minimizing GPU memory consumption and accelerating the training process. (2) Layer Alignment, where the newly trained layers are reintegrated into the original model, followed by a brief full fine-tuning step on a small dataset to align the parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that the ELO method achieves a training speedup of up to 6.46 times compared to existing methods, while improving target language performance by up to 6.2\% on qualitative benchmarks and effectively preserving source language (English) capabilities.

TL;DR: SyncThink是一种无需训练、即插即用的解码方法，通过监测模型自身的推理转换信号来提前终止冗余推理过程，在减少推理开销的同时提升或保持准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-Thought（CoT）提示虽能提升推理能力，但常生成冗长且重复的推理链，显著增加推理成本。

Method: 基于观察到答案token主要关注特殊token“/think”而非早期推理内容，SyncThink设计为实时监控模型内部的推理-转换信号，并据此动态截断CoT生成过程。

Result: 在GSM8K、MMLU、GPQA和BBH等多个基准上，SyncThink相比完整CoT平均节省约70% token数与70%延迟，同时将Top-1准确率从61.22%提升至62.00%；在GPQA等长程任务中更可提升高达+8.1绝对准确率。

Conclusion: SyncThink验证了无需修改模型权重即可高效压缩CoT推理路径的可行性，为降低大模型推理开销提供了轻量、通用的新范式。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning but often produces long and redundant traces that substantially increase inference cost. We present SyncThink, a training-free and plug-and-play decoding method that reduces CoT overhead without modifying model weights. We find that answer tokens attend weakly to early reasoning and instead focus on the special token "/think", indicating an information bottleneck. Building on this observation, SyncThink monitors the model's own reasoning-transition signal and terminates reasoning. Experiments on GSM8K, MMLU, GPQA, and BBH across three DeepSeek-R1 distilled models show that SyncThink achieves 62.00 percent average Top-1 accuracy using 656 generated tokens and 28.68 s latency, compared to 61.22 percent, 2141 tokens, and 92.01 s for full CoT decoding. On long-horizon tasks such as GPQA, SyncThink can further yield up to +8.1 absolute accuracy by preventing over-thinking.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出e5-omni，一种轻量级显式对齐方法，用于改进多模态嵌入模型，解决现有模型中相似度尺度不一致、难负样本失效及跨模态统计不匹配等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 omni-modal 嵌入模型依赖预训练视觉语言模型（VLM）的隐式对齐，导致相似度分数尺度不一致、负样本训练效率下降、跨模态嵌入统计特性不匹配三大问题。

Method: e5-omni 包含三个核心组件：(1) 模态感知的温度校准以统一相似度尺度；(2) 可控负样本课程学习与去偏机制，聚焦易混淆负样本并抑制错误负样本影响；(3) 批归一化结合协方差正则化，提升共享嵌入空间中跨模态几何一致性。

Result: 在 MMEB-V2 和 AudioCaps 上显著优于强基线（包括双模态和 omni-modal 模型），且该方法可迁移至其他 VLM 骨干网络。

Conclusion: 显式对齐比依赖隐式对齐更鲁棒有效；e5-omni 提供了一种通用、轻量、即插即用的 omni-modal 嵌入增强方案。

Abstract: Modern information systems often involve different types of items, e.g., a text query, an image, a video clip, or an audio segment. This motivates omni-modal embedding models that map heterogeneous modalities into a shared space for direct comparison. However, most recent omni-modal embeddings still rely heavily on implicit alignment inherited from pretrained vision-language model (VLM) backbones. In practice, this causes three common issues: (i) similarity logits have modality-dependent sharpness, so scores are not on a consistent scale; (ii) in-batch negatives become less effective over time because mixed-modality batches create an imbalanced hardness distribution; as a result, many negatives quickly become trivial and contribute little gradient; and (iii) embeddings across modalities show mismatched first- and second-order statistics, which makes rankings less stable. To tackle these problems, we propose e5-omni, a lightweight explicit alignment recipe that adapts off-the-shelf VLMs into robust omni-modal embedding models. e5-omni combines three simple components: (1) modality-aware temperature calibration to align similarity scales, (2) a controllable negative curriculum with debiasing to focus on confusing negatives while reducing the impact of false negatives, and (3) batch whitening with covariance regularization to better match cross-modal geometry in the shared embedding space. Experiments on MMEB-V2 and AudioCaps show consistent gains over strong bi-modal and omni-modal baselines, and the same recipe also transfers well to other VLM backbones. We release our model checkpoint at https://huggingface.co/Haon-Chen/e5-omni-7B.

TL;DR: eTracer 是一种即插即用的可追溯文本生成框架，通过后验式声明级证据对齐，提升生物医学领域系统响应的可验证性与可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险的生物医学领域，亟需高效验证系统生成响应的真实性与可靠性。

Method: 提出 eTracer 框架，采用后验式声明级（claim-level）接地（grounding）技术，将每个响应声明与支持或反驳它的上下文证据对齐，并据此量化响应的忠实度（faithfulness）。

Result: 实验表明，该声明级接地方法显著优于传统句子级接地方法，在接地质量与用户验证效率上均有大幅提升。

Conclusion: eTracer 实现了响应的可追溯性与可量化验证，增强了生成内容在关键领域的可信度与实用性。

Abstract: How can system-generated responses be efficiently verified, especially in the high-stakes biomedical domain? To address this challenge, we introduce eTracer, a plug-and-play framework that enables traceable text generation by grounding claims against contextual evidence. Through post-hoc grounding, each response claim is aligned with contextual evidence that either supports or contradicts it. Building on claim-level grounding results, eTracer not only enables users to precisely trace responses back to their contextual source but also quantifies response faithfulness, thereby enabling the verifiability and trustworthiness of generated responses. Experiments show that our claim-level grounding approach alleviates the limitations of conventional grounding methods in aligning generated statements with contextual sentence-level evidence, resulting in substantial improvements in overall grounding quality and user verification efficiency. The code and data are available at https://github.com/chubohao/eTracer.

TL;DR: 本文提出了DisastQA，一个面向灾害管理的大型问答基准，包含3000个问题，强调在不确定和冲突信息下的推理能力，并设计了新评估协议，揭示现有模型在真实噪声场景下可靠性严重不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有QA基准基于干净证据构建，无法反映灾害管理中需处理不确定与冲突信息的真实推理需求。

Method: 提出DisastQA基准，含3000个问题（2000多选+1000开放），覆盖8类灾害；采用人机协作+分层采样构建；设计噪声鲁棒性评估范式及开放题关键点人工验证评估协议。

Result: 20个模型实验表明：在干净条件下开源模型接近闭源系统，但在噪声证据下性能急剧下降，显著偏离MMLU-Pro等通用榜单排名，暴露灾害响应中的关键可靠性缺陷。

Conclusion: DisastQA揭示了当前大模型在高风险、低容错灾害场景下的推理脆弱性，强调需发展面向不确定性推理的专用评估与建模方法。

Abstract: Accurate question answering (QA) in disaster management requires reasoning over uncertain and conflicting information, a setting poorly captured by existing benchmarks built on clean evidence. We introduce DisastQA, a large-scale benchmark of 3,000 rigorously verified questions (2,000 multiple-choice and 1,000 open-ended) spanning eight disaster types. The benchmark is constructed via a human-LLM collaboration pipeline with stratified sampling to ensure balanced coverage. Models are evaluated under varying evidence conditions, from closed-book to noisy evidence integration, enabling separation of internal knowledge from reasoning under imperfect information. For open-ended QA, we propose a human-verified keypoint-based evaluation protocol emphasizing factual completeness over verbosity. Experiments with 20 models reveal substantial divergences from general-purpose leaderboards such as MMLU-Pro. While recent open-weight models approach proprietary systems in clean settings, performance degrades sharply under realistic noise, exposing critical reliability gaps for disaster response. All code, data, and evaluation resources are available at https://github.com/TamuChen18/DisastQA_open.

*Weiqi Liu,Yongliang Miao,Haiyan Zhao,Yanguang Liu,Mengnan Du*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出NeuronScope多智能体框架，通过迭代式、激活引导的方式分解神经元激活，揭示大语言模型中神经元的多义性，并提升解释与激活的相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单次解释方法难以准确捕捉大语言模型中神经元广泛存在的多义性（即一个神经元响应多个不同语义概念）问题。

Method: NeuronScope是一种多智能体框架，将神经元解释重构为迭代式、激活引导的过程：先将神经元激活分解为原子语义成分，再聚类为不同语义模式，最后利用神经元激活反馈迭代优化各解释。

Result: 实验表明，NeuronScope能有效揭示隐藏的多义性，其生成的解释与神经元激活的相关性显著高于单次通过基线方法。

Conclusion: NeuronScope为大语言模型神经元级可解释性提供了更精细、更忠实的多义性建模与解释方法。

Abstract: Neuron-level interpretation in large language models (LLMs) is fundamentally challenged by widespread polysemanticity, where individual neurons respond to multiple distinct semantic concepts. Existing single-pass interpretation methods struggle to faithfully capture such multi-concept behavior. In this work, we propose NeuronScope, a multi-agent framework that reformulates neuron interpretation as an iterative, activation-guided process. NeuronScope explicitly deconstructs neuron activations into atomic semantic components, clusters them into distinct semantic modes, and iteratively refines each explanation using neuron activation feedback. Experiments demonstrate that NeuronScope uncovers hidden polysemanticity and produces explanations with significantly higher activation correlation compared to single-pass baselines.

*Yifan Wei,Li Du,Xiaoyan Yu,Yang Feng,Angsheng Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出STEPS框架，通过技能分类学引导的熵基后训练数据合成方法，解决大语言模型和基于代理系统在组合泛化上的数据瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）和基于代理的系统在组合泛化方面表现不佳，主要受限于复杂技能组合数据稀疏（长尾分布），导致指令遵循和代理任务泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出STEPS框架：首先利用结构信息论构建可解释的层次化技能分类学；然后将数据合成建模为受约束的信息最大化问题，在技能层级中选择能最大化边际结构信息且语义连贯的技能组合。

Result: 在多个具有挑战性的指令遵循基准测试中，STEPS优于现有数据合成基线，并在下游基于代理的任务评估中显著提升组合泛化能力。

Conclusion: STEPS通过显式建模技能间的潜在关系与层级结构，有效缓解组合泛化中的数据瓶颈，为提升LLMs与智能体系统的泛化能力提供了新范式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and agent-based systems often struggle with compositional generalization due to a data bottleneck in which complex skill combinations follow a long-tailed, power-law distribution, limiting both instruction-following performance and generalization in agent-centric tasks. To address this challenge, we propose STEPS, a Skill Taxonomy guided Entropy-based Post-training data Synthesis framework for generating compositionally challenging data. STEPS explicitly targets compositional generalization by uncovering latent relationships among skills and organizing them into an interpretable, hierarchical skill taxonomy using structural information theory. Building on this taxonomy, we formulate data synthesis as a constrained information maximization problem, selecting skill combinations that maximize marginal structural information within the hierarchy while preserving semantic coherence. Experiments on challenging instruction-following benchmarks show that STEPS outperforms existing data synthesis baselines, while also yielding improved compositional generalization in downstream agent-based evaluations.

*Shaojie Wang,Liang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出First-Step Logical Reasoning (FSLR)框架，通过监督模型在解题第一步（识别变量与操作）中显式学习逻辑关系，显著提升LLM数学推理能力，同时大幅降低训练开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在数学推理中主要依赖模式匹配和记忆，缺乏对逻辑关系的真正理解，且CoT-SFT方法对此改善有限。

Method: 提出FSLR轻量训练框架，聚焦于解题的第一步规划（选择变量和操作），对该步骤进行显式监督训练，以直接促进逻辑关系理解。

Result: FSLR在多个模型和数据集上均优于CoT-SFT，在分布内和分布外设置下平均提升3.2%和4.6%，训练速度提升4–6倍，token消耗减少超80%。

Conclusion: 显式监督逻辑关系理解的关键第一步可有效突破LLM数学推理瓶颈，FSLR为高效提升逻辑推理能力提供了新范式。

Abstract: Recent studies reveal that large language models (LLMs) exhibit limited logical reasoning abilities in mathematical problem-solving, instead often relying on pattern-matching and memorization. We systematically analyze this limitation, focusing on logical relationship understanding, which is a core capability underlying genuine logical reasoning, and reveal that errors related to this capability account for over 90\% of incorrect predictions, with Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-Tuning (CoT-SFT) failing to substantially reduce these errors. To address this bottleneck, we propose First-Step Logical Reasoning (FSLR), a lightweight training framework targeting logical relationship understanding. Our key insight is that the first planning step-identifying which variables to use and which operation to apply-encourages the model to derive logical relationships directly from the problem statement. By training models on this isolated step, FSLR provides explicit supervision for logical relationship understanding, unlike CoT-SFT which implicitly embeds such relationships within complete solution trajectories. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that FSLR consistently outperforms CoT-SFT under both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, with average improvements of 3.2\% and 4.6\%, respectively. Moreover, FSLR achieves 4-6x faster training and reduces training token consumption by over 80\%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结构化的AI故事生成创意性评估框架，包含新颖性、价值、一致性与共鸣四个主维度及十一个子维度，并通过Spike Prompting和115名读者的众包实验，揭示人类对创意的判断具有层次性与反思性调整特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于参考的指标无法捕捉创意主观性，导致创意文本生成评估困难。

Method: 构建四维十一子项的结构化评估框架；采用Spike Prompting进行可控故事生成；开展115名读者的 crowdsourced 实验，区分即时与反思性人类创意判断。

Result: 发现创意评估呈层次性而非累积性，不同维度在判断不同阶段凸显；反思性评估显著改变评分结果和评分者间一致性。

Conclusion: 所提框架能有效揭示被传统参考式评估掩盖的创意维度，提升AI生成故事的创意性评估效度。

Abstract: Evaluating creative text generation remains a challenge because existing reference-based metrics fail to capture the subjective nature of creativity. We propose a structured evaluation framework for AI story generation comprising four components (Novelty, Value, Adherence, and Resonance) and eleven sub-components. Using controlled story generation via ``Spike Prompting'' and a crowdsourced study of 115 readers, we examine how different creative components shape both immediate and reflective human creativity judgments. Our findings show that creativity is evaluated hierarchically rather than cumulatively, with different dimensions becoming salient at different stages of judgment, and that reflective evaluation substantially alters both ratings and inter-rater agreement. Together, these results support the effectiveness of our framework in revealing dimensions of creativity that are obscured by reference-based evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出ADEPT方法，通过自适应动态早退机制，在预填充和生成阶段实现token级别的早退，解耦跳过层的KV缓存依赖，显著提升大语言模型推理效率与性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有早退策略仅适用于首token或prompt级别，导致跳过层的KV缓存仍成为后续token生成的瓶颈，限制了早退效益。

Method: 提出ADEPT框架，包含自适应token级早退机制和跳过层KV生成解耦技术，支持prefill与generation双阶段动态早退。

Result: 在语言生成任务中效率提升达25%，下游分类任务加速4倍，性能最高提升45%。

Conclusion: ADEPT有效缓解KV缓存瓶颈，实现了高效且高性能的动态早退推理。

Abstract: The inference of large language models imposes significant computational workloads, often requiring the processing of billions of parameters. Although early-exit strategies have proven effective in reducing computational demands by halting inference earlier, they apply either to only the first token in the generation phase or at the prompt level in the prefill phase. Thus, the Key-Value (KV) cache for skipped layers remains a bottleneck for subsequent token generation, limiting the benefits of early exit. We introduce ADEPT (Adaptive Dynamic Early-exit Process for Transformers), a novel approach designed to overcome this issue and enable dynamic early exit in both the prefill and generation phases. The proposed adaptive token-level early-exit mechanism adjusts computation dynamically based on token complexity, optimizing efficiency without compromising performance. ADEPT further enhances KV generation procedure by decoupling sequential dependencies in skipped layers, making token-level early exit more practical. Experimental results demonstrate that ADEPT improves efficiency by up to 25% in language generation tasks and achieves a 4x speed-up in downstream classification tasks, with up to a 45% improvement in performance.

*Yunhao Liang,Ruixuan Ying,Bo Li,Hong Li,Kai Yan,Qingwen Li,Min Yang,Okamoto Satoshi,Zhe Cui,Shiwen Ni*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过语义破坏实验揭示DeepSeek-OCR高度依赖语言先验而非真实OCR能力，其性能在失去语言支持时骤降；相比传统OCR流水线，端到端方法鲁棒性差，且视觉token越少越易幻觉；长上下文压力下模型在约10,000文本token时完全崩溃，表明当前光学压缩可能加剧长上下文瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究DeepSeek-OCR的高性能究竟是源于其视觉能力（光学2D映射）还是依赖语言大模型先验（linguistic crutch），厘清其真实OCR能力边界。

Method: 采用句子级和词级语义破坏（semantic corruption）策略，剥离语言先验影响，评估模型内在OCR能力；对比13种基线OCR模型的鲁棒性；分析视觉token数量与先验依赖、幻觉风险的关系；进行长上下文压力测试。

Result: DeepSeek-OCR在无语言支持时准确率从~90%暴跌至20%；传统流水线OCR比端到端方法对语义扰动鲁棒得多；视觉token越少，越依赖语言先验、幻觉越严重；在约10,000文本token时发生整体模型崩溃。

Conclusion: DeepSeek-OCR本质上是语言驱动的‘伪OCR’，其宣称的高比率视觉-文本压缩并未真正缓解LLM长上下文瓶颈，反而可能因过度压缩和先验依赖而加剧该问题；研究为未来视觉-文本压缩范式优化提供了关键实证依据与边界定义。

Abstract: DeepSeek-OCR utilizes an optical 2D mapping approach to achieve high-ratio vision-text compression, claiming to decode text tokens exceeding ten times the input visual tokens. While this suggests a promising solution for the LLM long-context bottleneck, we investigate a critical question: "Visual merit or linguistic crutch - which drives DeepSeek-OCR's performance?" By employing sentence-level and word-level semantic corruption, we isolate the model's intrinsic OCR capabilities from its language priors. Results demonstrate that without linguistic support, DeepSeek-OCR's performance plummets from approximately 90% to 20%. Comparative benchmarking against 13 baseline models reveals that traditional pipeline OCR methods exhibit significantly higher robustness to such semantic perturbations than end-to-end methods. Furthermore, we find that lower visual token counts correlate with increased reliance on priors, exacerbating hallucination risks. Context stress testing also reveals a total model collapse around 10,000 text tokens, suggesting that current optical compression techniques may paradoxically aggravate the long-context bottleneck. This study empirically defines DeepSeek-OCR's capability boundaries and offers essential insights for future optimizations of the vision-text compression paradigm. We release all data, results and scripts used in this study at https://github.com/dududuck00/DeepSeekOCR.

Conclusion: MIND实现了从被动模仿到主动认知构建的知识蒸馏范式转变，显著提升了小模型的推理泛化能力。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged with remarkable capabilities in complex tasks through Chain-of-Thought reasoning, practical resource constraints have sparked interest in transferring these abilities to smaller models. However, achieving both domain performance and cross-domain generalization remains challenging. Existing approaches typically restrict students to following a single golden rationale and treat different reasoning paths independently. Due to distinct inductive biases and intrinsic preferences, alongside the student's evolving capacity and reasoning preferences during training, a teacher's "optimal" rationale could act as out-of-distribution noise. This misalignment leads to a degeneration of the student's latent reasoning distribution, causing suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, we propose MIND, a capability-adaptive framework that transitions distillation from passive mimicry to active cognitive construction. We synthesize diverse teacher perspectives through a novel "Teaching Assistant" network. By employing a Feedback-Driven Inertia Calibration mechanism, this network utilizes inertia-filtered training loss to align supervision with the student's current adaptability, effectively enhancing performance while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MIND achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks, and our sophisticated latent space analysis further confirms the mechanism of reasoning ability internalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动语音识别系统在处理口吃语音时性能显著下降，尤其在印尼语等低资源语言中，缺乏专门的口吃语音数据集。

Method: 构建一个数据增强框架：首先对流利文本进行基于规则和大语言模型的重复、延长等口吃模式注入，再通过TTS合成生成口吃语音；然后用该合成数据微调预训练的印尼语Whisper模型。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能持续降低口吃语音的识别错误率，同时不损害对流利语音的识别性能。

Conclusion: 合成数据流水线可有效弥补低资源语言中口吃语音数据缺失问题，推动更具包容性的语音技术发展。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition systems have achieved remarkable performance on fluent speech but continue to degrade significantly when processing stuttered speech, a limitation that is particularly acute for low-resource languages like Indonesian where specialized datasets are virtually non-existent. To overcome this scarcity, we propose a data augmentation framework that generates synthetic stuttered audio by injecting repetitions and prolongations into fluent text through a combination of rule-based transformations and large language models followed by text-to-speech synthesis. We apply this synthetic data to fine-tune a pre-trained Indonesian Whisper model using transfer learning, enabling the architecture to adapt to dysfluent acoustic patterns without requiring large-scale real-world recordings. Our experiments demonstrate that this targeted synthetic exposure consistently reduces recognition errors on stuttered speech while maintaining performance on fluent segments, validating the utility of synthetic data pipelines for developing more inclusive speech technologies in under-represented languages.

Abstract: The performance gap between closed-source and open-source large language models (LLMs) is largely attributed to disparities in access to high-quality training data. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel framework for the automated synthesis of sophisticated, research-grade instructional data. Our approach centers on a multi-agent workflow where collaborative AI agents simulate complex tool-integrated reasoning to generate diverse and high-fidelity data end-to-end. Leveraging this synthesized data, we develop a two-stage training strategy that integrates supervised fine-tuning with a novel reinforcement learning method, designed to maximize model alignment and capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework empowers open-source models across multiple scales, enabling them to achieve new state-of-the-art performance on the major deep research benchmark. This work provides a scalable and effective pathway for advancing open-source LLMs without relying on proprietary data or models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大语言模型（LLMs）在检索增强生成中面对知识冲突时对信息来源的偏好，发现其倾向于机构验证的信息（如政府、新闻网站），但该偏好易被低可信度来源的重复信息所逆转；为此提出一种新方法，可将重复偏差降低高达99.8%，同时保留至少88.8%的原始偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究未考察检索信息的来源对LLM知识冲突解决行为的影响，而现实中LLM越来越多用于检索增强生成，知识冲突频发，因此需系统探究源可信度如何影响其判断。

Method: 构建一个新颖的评估框架，基于跨学科可信度研究，对13个开源LLM进行严格控制的综合评测；设计实验探测源偏好及其受重复信息干扰的机制，并提出一种缓解重复偏差的新方法。

Result: LLMs显著偏好机构来源（如政府、报纸）信息而非个人或社交媒体信息；但仅需重复低可信度来源内容即可逆转该偏好；所提方法能将重复偏差降低最多99.8%，同时保持至少88.8%的原始源偏好。

Conclusion: LLM的知识整合并非单纯依赖内容，而是隐式建模了信息来源的可信度；但该机制脆弱，易受表层重复干扰；提升鲁棒性需在模型训练或推理中显式建模来源可信度与内容一致性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are more frequently used in retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, it is increasingly relevant to study their behavior under knowledge conflicts. Thus far, the role of the source of the retrieved information has gone unexamined. We address this gap with a novel framework to investigate how source preferences affect LLM resolution of inter-context knowledge conflicts in English, motivated by interdisciplinary research on credibility. With a comprehensive, tightly-controlled evaluation of 13 open-weight LLMs, we find that LLMs prefer institutionally-corroborated information (e.g., government or newspaper sources) over information from people and social media. However, these source preferences can be reversed by simply repeating information from less credible sources. To mitigate repetition effects and maintain consistent preferences, we propose a novel method that reduces repetition bias by up to 99.8%, while also maintaining at least 88.8% of original preferences. We release all data and code to encourage future work on credibility and source preferences in knowledge-intensive NLP.

TL;DR: 本文研究了大语言模型在10种语言中生成个性化虚假信息的能力及其可检测性，发现平台层面的个性化比人口统计学层面的个性化更显著降低文本可检测性，尤其在英语中效果最明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究仅在英语中发现个性化会降低机器生成文本的可检测性，本文旨在跨语言（10种）验证该现象，并同时探讨个性化带来的潜在风险与益处。

Method: 系统性地测试16个不同语言模型在1080种个性化提示组合下生成的17280篇文本，涵盖面向人口统计群体和社交媒体平台两类个性化维度，并评估其生成质量与可检测性。

Result: 不同语言中个性化生成质量存在差异；面向平台的个性化比面向人口统计群体的个性化对降低文本可检测性影响更大，尤其在英语中最为显著。

Conclusion: 个性化能力具有语言依赖性，平台导向的个性化显著削弱检测效果，需针对多语言场景制定差异化监管与检测策略。

Abstract: Capabilities of large language models to generate multilingual coherent text have continuously enhanced in recent years, which opens concerns about their potential misuse. Previous research has shown that they can be misused for generation of personalized disinformation in multiple languages. It has also been observed that personalization negatively affects detectability of machine-generated texts; however, this has been studied in the English language only. In this work, we examine this phenomenon across 10 languages, while we focus not only on potential misuse of personalization capabilities, but also on potential benefits they offer. Overall, we cover 1080 combinations of various personalization aspects in the prompts, for which the texts are generated by 16 distinct language models (17,280 texts in total). Our results indicate that there are differences in personalization quality of the generated texts when targeting demographic groups and when targeting social-media platforms across languages. Personalization towards platforms affects detectability of the generated texts in a higher scale, especially in English, where the personalization quality is the highest.

*Pingjun Hong,Benjamin Roth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大语言模型（LLM）生成的自我解释是否有助于人类和LLM预测其在反事实问题上的行为，结果表明解释确实提升了预测准确性，但效果受扰动策略与判断者能力影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM能生成链式思维等自我解释，但这些解释未必真实反映其决策过程；本文关注其是否仍具实用价值——即能否提升用户对模型行为的可模拟性（特别是反事实情境下的预测能力）。

Method: 在StrategyQA数据集上，通过对比有无链式思维或事后解释的条件，评估人类与LLM裁判对模型反事实后续问题回答的预测准确率；同时比较LLM生成的反事实扰动与基于语用学的扰动方式；并开展人类自由文本归因的定性分析。

Result: 自我解释显著且一致地提升了人类与LLM裁判的反事实模拟准确率；但增益幅度与稳定性高度依赖于扰动策略类型及裁判能力；定性分析显示，解释帮助人类形成更准确的预测依据。

Conclusion: LLM的自我解释虽未必忠实于内部机制，但仍具有实际认知辅助价值，可增强用户对模型行为的预测能力，尤其在设计合理扰动与适配裁判能力时效果更稳健。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can produce verbalized self-explanations, yet prior studies suggest that such rationales may not reliably reflect the model's true decision process. We ask whether these explanations nevertheless help users predict model behavior, operationalized as counterfactual simulatability. Using StrategyQA, we evaluate how well humans and LLM judges can predict a model's answers to counterfactual follow-up questions, with and without access to the model's chain-of-thought or post-hoc explanations. We compare LLM-generated counterfactuals with pragmatics-based perturbations as alternative ways to construct test cases for assessing the potential usefulness of explanations. Our results show that self-explanations consistently improve simulation accuracy for both LLM judges and humans, but the degree and stability of gains depend strongly on the perturbation strategy and judge strength. We also conduct a qualitative analysis of free-text justifications written by human users when predicting the model's behavior, which provides evidence that access to explanations helps humans form more accurate predictions on the perturbed questions.

### [145] [Tracing the complexity profiles of different linguistic phenomena through the intrinsic dimension of LLM representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03779)
*Marco Baroni,Emily Cheng,Iria deDios-Flores,Francesca Franzon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了大语言模型（LLM）表征的内在维度（ID）作为语言复杂性的指标，发现ID能区分形式复杂性（如并列/从属从句）与功能复杂性（如右分支/中心嵌入、歧义附着），且其变化模式与已知抽象语言加工阶段相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLM表征的内在维度（ID）能否作为衡量语言复杂性（包括形式与功能层面）的有效指标，并验证其是否对应人类语言加工的认知阶段。

Method: 分析不同LLM各层表征的内在维度（ID），对比多种句法结构（如并列/从属、右分支/中心嵌入、歧义/非歧义附着）下的ID变化；辅以表征相似性分析和层消融实验。

Result: 形式复杂性（多从句结构）显著影响ID，其ID变化起始点与已有研究中抽象语言加工阶段一致；功能复杂性也影响ID但效应较弱，且不关联同一加工阶段；该模式在多个LLM中具有一致性。

Conclusion: ID是LLM中刻画语言复杂性的有效指标，可区分不同类型复杂性，并反映跨模型共通的语言加工阶段。

Abstract: We explore the intrinsic dimension (ID) of LLM representations as a marker of linguistic complexity, asking if different ID profiles across LLM layers differentially characterize formal and functional complexity. We find the formal contrast between sentences with multiple coordinated or subordinated clauses to be reflected in ID differences whose onset aligns with a phase of more abstract linguistic processing independently identified in earlier work. The functional contrasts between sentences characterized by right branching vs. center embedding or unambiguous vs. ambiguous relative clause attachment are also picked up by ID, but in a less marked way, and they do not correlate with the same processing phase. Further experiments using representational similarity and layer ablation confirm the same trends. We conclude that ID is a useful marker of linguistic complexity in LLMs, that it allows to differentiate between different types of complexity, and that it points to similar stages of linguistic processing across disparate LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了音频大语言模型（ALLMs）通过声纹无意泄露用户隐私的问题，提出HearSay基准测试集，并发现ALLMs存在显著隐私泄露、现有安全机制不足、以及推理过程会加剧风险三大问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Audio Large Language Models (ALLMs)在理解和生成方面取得显著进展，但其潜在的隐私影响尚未被充分探索。本文旨在首次系统性地探究ALLMs是否仅通过声纹就可能无意泄露用户隐私。

Method: 构建了名为HearSay的综合基准测试集，包含22000多个真实世界音频片段；采用自动化画像分析与人工验证相结合的严格流程确保数据质量；在该基准上开展大量实验，评估ALLMs对性别、生理及社会属性等隐私信息的提取能力，以及现有拒绝机制和Chain-of-Thought推理对隐私风险的影响。

Result: 1) ALLMs能以92.89%准确率从声纹中推断性别，并有效刻画社会属性；2) 现有安全机制严重不足，多数模型对涉及生理特征的隐私侵入请求几乎不拒绝；3) Chain-of-Thought推理在强能力模型中会加剧隐私风险，揭示更深层声学关联。

Conclusion: ALLMs存在严重隐私漏洞，亟需针对性的隐私对齐策略；相关代码与数据集已开源。

Abstract: While Audio Large Language Models (ALLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in understanding and generation, their potential privacy implications remain largely unexplored. This paper takes the first step to investigate whether ALLMs inadvertently leak user privacy solely through acoustic voiceprints and introduces $\textit{HearSay}$, a comprehensive benchmark constructed from over 22,000 real-world audio clips. To ensure data quality, the benchmark is meticulously curated through a rigorous pipeline involving automated profiling and human verification, guaranteeing that all privacy labels are grounded in factual records. Extensive experiments on $\textit{HearSay}$ yield three critical findings: $\textbf{Significant Privacy Leakage}$: ALLMs inherently extract private attributes from voiceprints, reaching 92.89% accuracy on gender and effectively profiling social attributes. $\textbf{Insufficient Safety Mechanisms}$: Alarmingly, existing safeguards are severely inadequate; most models fail to refuse privacy-intruding requests, exhibiting near-zero refusal rates for physiological traits. $\textbf{Reasoning Amplifies Risk}$: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning exacerbates privacy risks in capable models by uncovering deeper acoustic correlations. These findings expose critical vulnerabilities in ALLMs, underscoring the urgent need for targeted privacy alignment. The codes and dataset are available at https://github.com/JinWang79/HearSay_Benchmark

### [147] [Membox: Weaving Topic Continuity into Long-Range Memory for LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03785)
*Dehao Tao,Guoliang Ma,Yongfeng Huang,Minghu Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出Membox，一种分层记忆架构，通过Topic Loom实时捕捉对话中的主题连续性并构建‘记忆盒’，再由Trace Weaver链接成长期事件时间线，显著提升LLM代理在时序推理任务中的性能与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理记忆系统采用碎片化-补偿范式，破坏对话的叙事与因果流，并偏向词法相似性检索，无法有效保持人类-代理对话中自然存在的主题连续性。

Method: 提出Membox架构：1）Topic Loom以滑动窗口方式持续监控对话，将同主题相邻话轮聚为‘记忆盒’；2）Trace Weaver将封存的记忆盒链接为长程事件时间线，恢复跨中断的宏观主题复现。

Result: 在LoCoMo基准上，Membox在时序推理任务F1值上相较Mem0、A-MEM等基线最高提升68%，且仅需极少上下文token，兼顾高效性与有效性。

Conclusion: Membox通过显式建模主题连续性，提供了一种符合认知机制的记忆方法，显著增强了LLM代理的对话连贯性与运行效率。

Abstract: Human-agent dialogues often exhibit topic continuity-a stable thematic frame that evolves through temporally adjacent exchanges-yet most large language model (LLM) agent memory systems fail to preserve it. Existing designs follow a fragmentation-compensation paradigm: they first break dialogue streams into isolated utterances for storage, then attempt to restore coherence via embedding-based retrieval. This process irreversibly damages narrative and causal flow, while biasing retrieval towards lexical similarity. We introduce membox, a hierarchical memory architecture centered on a Topic Loom that continuously monitors dialogue in a sliding-window fashion, grouping consecutive same-topic turns into coherent "memory boxes" at storage time. Sealed boxes are then linked by a Trace Weaver into long-range event-timeline traces, recovering macro-topic recurrences across discontinuities. Experiments on LoCoMo demonstrate that Membox achieves up to 68% F1 improvement on temporal reasoning tasks, outperforming competitive baselines (e.g., Mem0, A-MEM). Notably, Membox attains these gains while using only a fraction of the context tokens required by existing methods, highlighting a superior balance between efficiency and effectiveness. By explicitly modeling topic continuity, Membox offers a cognitively motivated mechanism for enhancing both coherence and efficiency in LLM agents.

### [148] [Compact Example-Based Explanations for Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03786)
*Loris Schoenegger,Benjamin Roth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需重训练的选择相关性评分指标，用于评估训练数据子集对模型输出解释的有效性，并发现常见选择策略常不如随机选择，进而提出一种兼顾影响力与代表性的新选择策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练数据影响估计方法缺乏对文档选择策略的评估，而人类只能理解少量示例，因此需有效选择最具解释力的训练样本。

Method: 提出一种无需重训练的选择相关性评分（selection relevance score），通过微调实验验证其预测能力，并设计一种平衡影响力与代表性的新选择策略。

Result: 验证了所提评分能准确预测示例集合对模型预测的支持或削弱作用；发现常用选择策略常劣于随机选择；新策略在有限选择预算下表现更优。

Conclusion: 选择策略对基于影响估计的解释质量至关重要；所提评分和新策略可显著提升解释有效性。

Abstract: Training data influence estimation methods quantify the contribution of training documents to a model's output, making them a promising source of information for example-based explanations. As humans cannot interpret thousands of documents, only a small subset of the training data can be presented as an explanation. Although the choice of which documents to include directly affects explanation quality, previous evaluations of such systems have largely ignored any selection strategies. To address this, we propose a novel selection relevance score, a retraining-free metric that quantifies how useful a set of examples is for explaining a model's output. We validate this score through fine-tuning experiments, confirming that it can predict whether a set of examples supports or undermines the model's predictions. Using this metric, we further show that common selection strategies often underperform random selection. Motivated by this finding, we propose a strategy that balances influence and representativeness, enabling better use of selection budgets than naively selecting the highest-ranking examples.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种面向新词翻译的智能体框架NeoAMT，利用Wiktionary构建多语言新词翻译数据集与检索工具，并结合强化学习与新颖奖励机制提升翻译质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新词感知机器翻译（NeoAMT）领域相比通用机器翻译仍被严重忽视，缺乏专用数据集、工具和训练方法。

Method: 构建覆盖16种语言、75个翻译方向的新词翻译数据集及基于Wiktionary的检索工具；设计基于翻译难度的强化学习训练框架，含新型奖励函数与自适应rollout生成策略。

Result: 成功开发了NeoAMT框架，在新词翻译任务上显著提升了翻译准确性；验证了检索增强与难度感知RL训练的有效性。

Conclusion: 引入外部知识检索与难度感知强化学习可有效提升新词翻译性能，为低资源/动态词汇场景下的MT提供了可行范式。

Abstract: Neologism-aware machine translation aims to translate source sentences containing neologisms into target languages. This field remains underexplored compared with general machine translation (MT). In this paper, we propose an agentic framework, NeoAMT, for neologism-aware machine translation using a Wiktionary search tool. Specifically, we first create a new dataset for neologism-aware machine translation and develop a search tool based on Wiktionary. The new dataset covers 16 languages and 75 translation directions and is derived from approximately 10 million records of an English Wiktionary dump. The retrieval corpus of the search tool is also constructed from around 3 million cleaned records of the Wiktionary dump. We then use it for training the translation agent with reinforcement learning (RL) and evaluating the accuracy of neologism-aware machine translation. Based on this, we also propose an RL training framework that contains a novel reward design and an adaptive rollout generation approach by leveraging "translation difficulty" to further improve the translation quality of translation agents using our search tool.

### [150] [Do LLMs Really Memorize Personally Identifiable Information? Revisiting PII Leakage with a Cue-Controlled Memorization Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03791)
*Xiaoyu Luo,Yiyi Chen,Qiongxiu Li,Johannes Bjerva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的评估大语言模型（LLM）记忆PII的框架——线索抵抗型记忆（CRM），强调在低线索条件下评估，发现先前报告的PII泄露主要源于提示中的表面线索而非真实记忆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PII泄露研究常将成功重建归因于模型记忆，但未控制提示中可能诱导重建的表面线索，导致对‘记忆’的误判；需建立更严谨、线索可控的评估标准。

Method: 提出线索抵抗型记忆（CRM）评估框架，形式化定义并控制提示与目标PII之间的词形/语义线索重叠；在32种语言上系统重评多种PII重建范式（前缀-后缀补全、关联重建、无线索生成、成员推断）。

Result: 在控制线索后，各类重建方法成功率大幅下降；无线索生成与成员推断的真阳性率极低；多数先前报道的PII泄露可归因于线索驱动行为而非真实记忆。

Conclusion: PII泄露不应简单等同于模型记忆；CRM是评估隐私相关记忆的必要条件；未来研究必须采用线索可控设计以保障评估可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been reported to "leak" Personally Identifiable Information (PII), with successful PII reconstruction often interpreted as evidence of memorization. We propose a principled revision of memorization evaluation for LLMs, arguing that PII leakage should be evaluated under low lexical cue conditions, where target PII cannot be reconstructed through prompt-induced generalization or pattern completion. We formalize Cue-Resistant Memorization (CRM) as a cue-controlled evaluation framework and a necessary condition for valid memorization evaluation, explicitly conditioning on prompt-target overlap cues. Using CRM, we conduct a large-scale multilingual re-evaluation of PII leakage across 32 languages and multiple memorization paradigms. Revisiting reconstruction-based settings, including verbatim prefix-suffix completion and associative reconstruction, we find that their apparent effectiveness is driven primarily by direct surface-form cues rather than by true memorization. When such cues are controlled for, reconstruction success diminishes substantially. We further examine cue-free generation and membership inference, both of which exhibit extremely low true positive rates. Overall, our results suggest that previously reported PII leakage is better explained by cue-driven behavior than by genuine memorization, highlighting the importance of cue-controlled evaluation for reliably quantifying privacy-relevant memorization in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了VietMed-MCQ数据集，首个面向越南传统医学（VTM）的多选题基准，采用带一致性校验的RAG流程生成，并通过双模型验证提升质量；在该数据集上评测7个开源模型，发现具中文先验的通用模型优于越南语专用模型，但所有模型在复杂诊断推理上仍表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在越南传统医学（VTM）等文化特异性专业领域性能显著下降，主因缺乏高质量、结构化的基准数据集。

Method: 提出基于检索增强生成（RAG）的合成框架，引入双模型独立验证机制保障推理一致性，并辅以子串证据检查；生成含3190道题、覆盖三级难度的VietMed-MCQ数据集，经1名医学专家与4名学生人工验证。

Result: VietMed-MCQ获94.2%人工批准率，Fleiss' kappa达0.82；7个开源模型评测显示：具强中文先验的通用模型表现优于越南语中心化模型，但所有模型在复杂诊断推理任务上均存在明显短板。

Conclusion: VietMed-MCQ填补了低资源传统医学领域高质量基准的空白，揭示了跨语言概念迁移的有效性及当前模型在专业深度推理上的局限，代码与数据集已开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in general medical domains. However, their performance significantly degrades in specialized, culturally specific domains such as Vietnamese Traditional Medicine (VTM), primarily due to the scarcity of high-quality, structured benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce VietMed-MCQ, a novel multiple-choice question dataset generated via a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline with an automated consistency check mechanism. Unlike previous synthetic datasets, our framework incorporates a dual-model validation approach to ensure reasoning consistency through independent answer verification, though the substring-based evidence checking has known limitations. The complete dataset of 3,190 questions spans three difficulty levels and underwent validation by one medical expert and four students, achieving 94.2 percent approval with substantial inter-rater agreement (Fleiss' kappa = 0.82). We benchmark seven open-source models on VietMed-MCQ. Results reveal that general-purpose models with strong Chinese priors outperform Vietnamese-centric models, highlighting cross-lingual conceptual transfer, while all models still struggle with complex diagnostic reasoning. Our code and dataset are publicly available to foster research in low-resource medical domains.

### [152] [Where meaning lives: Layer-wise accessibility of psycholinguistic features in encoder and decoder language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03798)
*Taisiia Tikhomirova,Dirk U. Wulff*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了58种心理语言学特征在10种Transformer模型各层中的编码位置，发现语义表征的定位高度依赖于嵌入提取方法（如上下文化vs孤立嵌入），且最终层并非心理语言学信息恢复的最佳层；不同模型和方法下仍存在一致的意义维度深度排序：词汇属性早峰、体验与情感维度晚峰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解Transformer语言模型在何处编码具有心理学意义的语义，对理论构建和实际应用均至关重要。

Method: 开展逐层探针分析（layer-wise probing），覆盖58种心理语言学特征、10种Transformer模型（含encoder-only和decoder-only架构），并比较三种嵌入提取方法。

Result: 上下文化嵌入比孤立嵌入表现出更高的特征特异性及不同的层分布；最终层表征通常不是线性探针恢复心理语言学信息的最优选择；所有模型和方法下均观察到一致的意义维度深度排序：词汇属性在较浅层达峰，而体验与情感维度在较深层达峰。

Conclusion: Transformer模型中语义的‘位置’并非固定不变，而是方法选择（如嵌入提取方式）与模型架构约束共同作用的结果。

Abstract: Understanding where transformer language models encode psychologically meaningful aspects of meaning is essential for both theory and practice. We conduct a systematic layer-wise probing study of 58 psycholinguistic features across 10 transformer models, spanning encoder-only and decoder-only architectures, and compare three embedding extraction methods. We find that apparent localization of meaning is strongly method-dependent: contextualized embeddings yield higher feature-specific selectivity and different layer-wise profiles than isolated embeddings. Across models and methods, final-layer representations are rarely optimal for recovering psycholinguistic information with linear probes. Despite these differences, models exhibit a shared depth ordering of meaning dimensions, with lexical properties peaking earlier and experiential and affective dimensions peaking later. Together, these results show that where meaning "lives" in transformer models reflects an interaction between methodological choices and architectural constraints.

<details>

Motivation: 学生越来越多地将大语言模型生成的内容当作自己的学术成果，严重损害学术诚信，亟需可靠、泛化能力强的AI文本检测方法。

Method: 构建基于HC3和DAIGT v2的统一基准，采用主题导向的数据划分策略以避免信息泄露；对比TF-IDF+逻辑回归、BiLSTM和DistilBERT等模型在准确率与ROC-AUC上的性能。

Result: TF-IDF+LR基线准确率为82.87%；BiLSTM达88.86%；DistilBERT准确率88.11%，ROC-AUC最高（0.96），综合性能最优；证实上下文语义建模显著优于词法特征。

Conclusion: 当前AI检测模型中，轻量级预训练模型（如DistilBERT）在平衡性能与效率方面最具潜力；未来需拓展数据多样性、引入参数高效微调（如LoRA）及硬件感知优化。

Abstract: The rapid development of large language models has led to an increase in AI-generated text, with students increasingly using LLM-generated content as their own work, which violates academic integrity. This paper presents an evaluation of AI text detection methods, including both traditional machine learning models and transformer-based architectures. We utilize two datasets, HC3 and DAIGT v2, to build a unified benchmark and apply a topic-based data split to prevent information leakage. This approach ensures robust generalization across unseen domains. Our experiments show that TF-IDF logistic regression achieves a reasonable baseline accuracy of 82.87%. However, deep learning models outperform it. The BiLSTM classifier achieves an accuracy of 88.86%, while DistilBERT achieves a similar accuracy of 88.11% with the highest ROC-AUC score of 0.96, demonstrating the strongest overall performance. The results indicate that contextual semantic modeling is significantly superior to lexical features and highlight the importance of mitigating topic memorization through appropriate evaluation protocols. The limitations of this work are primarily related to dataset diversity and computational constraints. In future work, we plan to expand dataset diversity and utilize parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as LoRA. We also plan to explore smaller or distilled models and employ more efficient batching strategies and hardware-aware optimization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出Step Potential Advantage Estimation (SPAE)，一种无需训练的细粒度优势估计方法，通过探测LLM推理过程中的中间置信度与正确性生成Step Potential信号，实现更精准的每步信用分配，从而提升准确率并缩短响应长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法依赖结果奖励，导致优势估计粗粒度；缺乏语义上合理、步骤级的推理进展度量，使模型难以区分必要推理与冗余验证，甚至推翻正确推理路径。

Method: 设计一种无训练的探针机制，提取每步的中间置信度和正确性，合成Step Potential信号；基于该信号提出SPAE，对潜在增益放大、潜在下降惩罚，并在潜力饱和后施加终止惩罚。

Result: 在多个基准上，SPAE持续提升准确率并显著缩短响应长度，优于强RL基线及近期高效推理与token级优势估计方法。

Conclusion: SPAE通过引入语义感知的步骤级信用分配机制，有效缓解了RLVR中因粗粒度奖励导致的推理低效与错误修正问题，为可控、可解释的推理优化提供了新范式。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) elicits long chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models (LLMs), but outcome-based rewards lead to coarse-grained advantage estimation. While existing approaches improve RLVR via token-level entropy or sequence-level length control, they lack a semantically grounded, step-level measure of reasoning progress. As a result, LLMs fail to distinguish necessary deduction from redundant verification: they may continue checking after reaching a correct solution and, in extreme cases, overturn a correct trajectory into an incorrect final answer. To remedy the lack of process supervision, we introduce a training-free probing mechanism that extracts intermediate confidence and correctness and combines them into a Step Potential signal that explicitly estimates the reasoning state at each step. Building on this signal, we propose Step Potential Advantage Estimation (SPAE), a fine-grained credit assignment method that amplifies potential gains, penalizes potential drops, and applies penalty after potential saturates to encourage timely termination. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show SPAE consistently improves accuracy while substantially reducing response length, outperforming strong RL baselines and recent efficient reasoning and token-level advantage estimation methods. The code is available at https://github.com/cii030/SPAE-RL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格剪枝方法依赖不可靠的批评信号进行顺序修订，常无法检测答案关键数据的丢失。

Method: TabTrim通过黄金SQL查询执行过程中的中间子表构建黄金剪枝轨迹，并训练剪枝器和验证器使逐步剪枝结果与该轨迹对齐；推理时采用并行搜索探索多个候选剪枝路径以找到最优子表。

Result: TabTrim在多种表格推理任务上达到SOTA性能：TabTrim-8B平均准确率达73.5%，较最强基线提升3.2%，其中WikiTQ达79.4%，TableBench达61.2%。

Conclusion: TabTrim通过引入黄金轨迹监督和平行搜索机制，有效提升了表格剪枝的可靠性与性能，为表格问答任务提供了新范式。

Abstract: Table Question Answering (TableQA) benefits significantly from table pruning, which extracts compact sub-tables by eliminating redundant cells to streamline downstream reasoning. However, existing pruning methods typically rely on sequential revisions driven by unreliable critique signals, often failing to detect the loss of answer-critical data. To address this limitation, we propose TabTrim, a novel table pruning framework which transforms table pruning from sequential revisions to gold trajectory-supervised parallel search. TabTrim derives a gold pruning trajectory using the intermediate sub-tables in the execution process of gold SQL queries, and trains a pruner and a verifier to make the step-wise pruning result align with the gold pruning trajectory. During inference, TabTrim performs parallel search to explore multiple candidate pruning trajectories and identify the optimal sub-table. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TabTrim achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tabular reasoning tasks: TabTrim-8B reaches 73.5% average accuracy, outperforming the strongest baseline by 3.2%, including 79.4% on WikiTQ and 61.2% on TableBench.

Result: InfiniteWeb在真实网站构建上超越商用编码智能体；基于其生成环境训练的GUI智能体在OSWorld和Online-Mind2Web上性能显著提升。

Conclusion: InfiniteWeb为GUI智能体提供了高质量、可扩展、可评估的训练环境，验证了合成数据驱动的智能体训练范式的有效性与实用性。

Abstract: GUI agents that interact with graphical interfaces on behalf of users represent a promising direction for practical AI assistants. However, training such agents is hindered by the scarcity of suitable environments. We present InfiniteWeb, a system that automatically generates functional web environments at scale for GUI agent training. While LLMs perform well on generating a single webpage, building a realistic and functional website with many interconnected pages faces challenges. We address these challenges through unified specification, task-centric test-driven development, and a combination of website seed with reference design image to ensure diversity. Our system also generates verifiable task evaluators enabling dense reward signals for reinforcement learning. Experiments show that InfiniteWeb surpasses commercial coding agents at realistic website construction, and GUI agents trained on our generated environments achieve significant performance improvements on OSWorld and Online-Mind2Web, demonstrating the effectiveness of proposed system.

### [157] [What Does Loss Optimization Actually Teach, If Anything? Knowledge Dynamics in Continual Pre-training of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03858)
*Seyed Mahed Mousavi,Simone Alghisi,Giuseppe Riccardi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了持续预训练（CPT）作为知识学习过程的本质，发现损失下降与实际事实知识获取并不一致：后者不稳定、非单调、依赖先验暴露，且导致域外能力退化；电路分析揭示知识通路快速重构，解释了窄窗口学习和系统性遗忘现象；因此，仅靠损失优化无法准确反映学习进展，需基于任务级学习动态设计停止准则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CPT实践将训练损失简单视为知识学习的代理指标，缺乏对知识如何随训练动态变化的深入理解与实证刻画。

Method: 构建受控、分布匹配的事实文档基准，将诊断探针嵌入CPT训练循环中，实现按训练轮次（epoch-level）追踪事实知识获取动态及域外（如数学）能力变化，并结合知识电路分析探究模型内部表征演化。

Result: 损失单调下降，但事实学习不稳定且非单调；新事实难以巩固，高度依赖先前接触；域外能力从早期即开始退化；知识电路在各轮次间快速重构，导致学习窗口狭窄和系统性遗忘。

Conclusion: CPT中损失优化与真实知识学习存在系统性错位，应摒弃单一依赖损失的停止策略，转而依据任务级学习动态设计评估与终止机制。

Abstract: Continual Pre-Training (CPT) is widely used for acquiring and updating factual knowledge in LLMs. This practice treats loss as a proxy for knowledge learning, while offering no grounding into how it changes during training. We study CPT as a knowledge learning process rather than a solely optimization problem. We construct a controlled, distribution-matched benchmark of factual documents and interleave diagnostic probes directly into the CPT loop, enabling epoch-level measurement of knowledge acquisition dynamics and changes in Out-Of-Domain (OOD) general skills (e.g., math). We further analyze how CPT reshapes knowledge circuits during training. Across three instruction-tuned LLMs and multiple CPT strategies, optimization and learning systematically diverge as loss decreases monotonically while factual learning is unstable and non-monotonic. Acquired facts are rarely consolidated, learning is strongly conditioned on prior exposure, and OOD performance degrades from early epochs. Circuit analysis reveals rapid reconfiguration of knowledge pathways across epochs, providing an explanation for narrow acquisition windows and systematic forgetting. These results show that loss optimization is misaligned with learning progress in CPT and motivate evaluation of stopping criteria based on task-level learning dynamics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了首个面向西班牙语、意大利语和葡萄牙语的多语言超党派新闻标题数据集PartisanLens，用于检测超党派叙事与人口替代阴谋论（PRCT），并系统评估了大语言模型（LLMs）在该任务上的分类性能、自动标注能力及对不同意识形态视角的建模能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有资源稀缺、以英语为主，且常孤立分析超党派性、立场和修辞偏见，而现实中这些维度相互交织；同时，超党派叙事加剧政治极化与制度不信任，PRCT更直接诱发极端暴力，亟需跨语言、多维度识别工具。

Method: 构建含1617条标题的多语言（西/意/葡）超党派新闻数据集PartisanLens，涵盖多个政治话语维度标注；评估主流LLMs在分类、自动标注任务上的表现；进一步通过注入社会经济与意识形态背景提示，探究LLMs模拟人类标注者视角的能力。

Result: LLMs在分类任务上建立了稳健基线，展现出自动标注潜力但存在明显局限；在条件化模拟不同标注者视角时，部分模型能部分复现人类标注模式差异，但一致性与可靠性仍不足。

Conclusion: PartisanLens填补了非英语超党派与PRCT检测研究的资源空白，推动多语言、多维度政治话语分析；LLMs具备辅助标注与视角建模的初步能力，但仍需改进以支撑高信度社会敏感任务。

Abstract: Detecting hyperpartisan narratives and Population Replacement Conspiracy Theories (PRCT) is essential to addressing the spread of misinformation. These complex narratives pose a significant threat, as hyperpartisanship drives political polarisation and institutional distrust, while PRCTs directly motivate real-world extremist violence, making their identification critical for social cohesion and public safety. However, existing resources are scarce, predominantly English-centric, and often analyse hyperpartisanship, stance, and rhetorical bias in isolation rather than as interrelated aspects of political discourse. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textsc{PartisanLens}, the first multilingual dataset of \num{1617} hyperpartisan news headlines in Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese, annotated in multiple political discourse aspects. We first evaluate the classification performance of widely used Large Language Models (LLMs) on this dataset, establishing robust baselines for the classification of hyperpartisan and PRCT narratives. In addition, we assess the viability of using LLMs as automatic annotators for this task, analysing their ability to approximate human annotation. Results highlight both their potential and current limitations. Next, moving beyond standard judgments, we explore whether LLMs can emulate human annotation patterns by conditioning them on socio-economic and ideological profiles that simulate annotator perspectives. At last, we provide our resources and evaluation, \textsc{PartisanLens} supports future research on detecting partisan and conspiratorial narratives in European contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文对大语言模型（LLM）和逻辑推理模型（LRM）的安全对齐能力进行了大规模实证研究，系统评估了6种内在模型特性与3种外部攻击技术的影响，覆盖32个主流模型、13个家族、5个安全数据集及56种越狱技术，发现集成推理与自省机制显著提升安全性，后训练与知识蒸馏可能损害安全对齐，CoT前缀攻击可使成功率激增3.34倍，角色扮演、提示注入与梯度搜索是主要越狱手段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为提升AI系统的安全性与可靠性，亟需厘清影响大语言模型与逻辑推理模型安全对齐的关键因素，识别脆弱环节并指导安全优化策略。

Method: 开展大规模实证评估：覆盖32个最新LLM/LRM（3B–235B参数）、13个模型家族；考察6种内在模型特性（如推理机制、训练方式）与3种外部攻击技术（如CoT前缀攻击、提示注入）；使用5个安全数据集、56种jailbreak技术与4种CoT攻击策略，共发起460万次API调用。

Result: 1）GPT-OSS-20B、Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking、GPT-OSS-120B为最安全模型，验证推理与自省机制的关键作用；2）后训练与知识蒸馏普遍削弱安全对齐，需将安全设为显式约束或核心优化目标；3）CoT响应前缀攻击平均提升攻击成功率3.34倍，对Seed-OSS-36B-Instruct达96.3%，暴露文本补全接口重大风险；4）角色扮演、提示注入与梯度搜索是当前主流越狱方法。

Conclusion: 安全对齐不能依赖事后修补，而应贯穿模型设计、训练与部署全流程；尤其需在架构层面防范CoT前缀等新型攻击，并将安全作为与能力同等重要的优化目标。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study on the safety alignment capabilities. We evaluate what matters for safety alignment in LLMs and LRMs to provide essential insights for developing more secure and reliable AI systems. We systematically investigate and compare the influence of six critical intrinsic model characteristics and three external attack techniques. Our large-scale evaluation is conducted using 32 recent, popular LLMs and LRMs across thirteen distinct model families, spanning a parameter scale from 3B to 235B. The assessment leverages five established safety datasets and probes model vulnerabilities with 56 jailbreak techniques and four CoT attack strategies, resulting in 4.6M API calls. Our key empirical findings are fourfold. First, we identify the LRMs GPT-OSS-20B, Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking, and GPT-OSS-120B as the top-three safest models, which substantiates the significant advantage of integrated reasoning and self-reflection mechanisms for robust safety alignment. Second, post-training and knowledge distillation may lead to a systematic degradation of safety alignment. We thus argue that safety must be treated as an explicit constraint or a core optimization objective during these stages, not merely subordinated to the pursuit of general capability. Third, we reveal a pronounced vulnerability: employing a CoT attack via a response prefix can elevate the attack success rate by 3.34x on average and from 0.6% to 96.3% for Seed-OSS-36B-Instruct. This critical finding underscores the safety risks inherent in text-completion interfaces and features that allow user-defined response prefixes in LLM services, highlighting an urgent need for architectural and deployment safeguards. Fourth, roleplay, prompt injection, and gradient-based search for adversarial prompts are the predominant methodologies for eliciting unaligned behaviors in modern models.

TL;DR: 本文提出ATLAS框架，通过无训练聚类路由和基于强化学习的多步路由，动态选择最优大模型与工具组合，在跨领域复杂推理任务中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型和外部工具种类增多，如何动态选择最优模型-工具组合成为高维优化难题；现有方法通常依赖单一模型或固定调用逻辑，无法充分利用异构模型-工具对的性能差异。

Method: 提出ATLAS双路径框架：(1) 无训练的基于聚类的路由，利用经验先验实现领域对齐；(2) 基于强化学习的多步路由，支持分布外泛化。

Result: 在15个基准测试中超越GPT-4o等闭源模型，在分布内任务上提升10.1%，分布外任务上提升13.1%；在视觉推理中通过协调多模态工具也取得显著增益。

Conclusion: ATLAS为动态、自适应地协同大语言模型与多样化工具提供了有效范式，提升了跨领域复杂推理能力。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) with external tools has significantly expanded the capabilities of AI agents. However, as the diversity of both LLMs and tools increases, selecting the optimal model-tool combination becomes a high-dimensional optimization challenge. Existing approaches often rely on a single model or fixed tool-calling logic, failing to exploit the performance variations across heterogeneous model-tool pairs. In this paper, we present ATLAS (Adaptive Tool-LLM Alignment and Synergistic Invocation), a dual-path framework for dynamic tool usage in cross-domain complex reasoning. ATLAS operates via a dual-path approach: (1) \textbf{training-free cluster-based routing} that exploits empirical priors for domain-specific alignment, and (2) \textbf{RL-based multi-step routing} that explores autonomous trajectories for out-of-distribution generalization. Extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms closed-source models like GPT-4o, surpassing existing routing methods on both in-distribution (+10.1%) and out-of-distribution (+13.1%) tasks. Furthermore, our framework shows significant gains in visual reasoning by orchestrating specialized multi-modal tools.

### [161] [Evaluating Small Decoder-Only Language Models for Grammar Correction and Text Simplification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03874)
*Anthony Lamelas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores whether small, decoder-only language models (SLMs) can serve as efficient alternatives to large language models (LLMs) for grammar correction and text simplification, finding that current SLMs underperform LLMs in accuracy, meaning preservation, and hallucination control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful but costly and hard to deploy; the paper investigates whether smaller, more efficient models can match their performance on grammar correction and text simplification.

Method: The authors evaluate small, decoder-only language models—both out-of-the-box and fine-tuned—on the JFLEG and ASSET datasets using standard metrics, comparing them to strong baselines and modern LLMs.

Result: SLMs show limited capability: they underperform LLMs and strong baselines, struggle with meaning retention, and suffer from hallucinations.

Conclusion: Despite efficiency benefits, current SLMs are not yet competitive with LLMs for rewriting tasks; further training advances are needed to close the performance gap.

Abstract: Large language models have become extremely popular recently due to their ability to achieve strong performance on a variety of tasks, such as text generation and rewriting, but their size and computation cost make them difficult to access, deploy, and secure in many settings. This paper investigates whether small, decoder-only language models can provide an efficient alternative for the tasks of grammar correction and text simplification. The experiments in this paper focus on testing small language models out of the box, fine-tuned, and run sequentially on the JFLEG and ASSET datasets using established metrics. The results show that while SLMs may learn certain behaviors well, their performance remains below strong baselines and current LLMs. The results also show that SLMs struggle with retaining meaning and hallucinations. These findings suggest that despite their efficiency advantages, current SLMs are not yet competitive enough with modern LLMs for rewriting, and further advances in training are required for SLMs to close the performance gap between them and today's LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法 indiscriminately 触发检索、依赖单路径证据构建，易引入噪声且性能增益有限。

Method: DTR利用生成不确定性动态决定是否检索，并设计双路径检索机制与自适应信息选择策略，以更好应对稀疏和模糊查询。

Result: 在五个开放域QA基准、多种模型规模及不同检索器上，DTR一致提升EM和F1指标，优于标准RAG及强检索增强基线，同时减少不必要的检索次数。

Conclusion: DTR是一种高效、通用、无需训练的RAG优化框架，能自适应地平衡检索开销与生成质量。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge, but existing approaches indiscriminately trigger retrieval and rely on single-path evidence construction, often introducing noise and limiting performance gains. In this work, we propose Decide Then Retrieve (DTR), a training-free framework that adaptively determines when retrieval is necessary and how external information should be selected. DTR leverages generation uncertainty to guide retrieval triggering and introduces a dual-path retrieval mechanism with adaptive information selection to better handle sparse and ambiguous queries. Extensive experiments across five open-domain QA benchmarks, multiple model scales, and different retrievers demonstrate that DTR consistently improves EM and F1 over standard RAG and strong retrieval-enhanced baselines, while reducing unnecessary retrievals.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了语言模型在多选题问答（MCQA）任务中的内部工作机制，发现模型先在内容空间中选择正确选项，再将其绑定到对应输出符号，揭示了两阶段的决策与符号绑定机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多选题问答（MCQA）评估简便，但将问题求解与符号输出耦合，难以区分推理错误与符号绑定失败，因此需探究模型内部如何实现MCQA。

Method: 采用表征分析（PCA、线性探针）和因果干预方法，分析选项边界残差状态、赢家身份探针，并在符号与内容置换条件下进行测试。

Result: 发现选项边界残差状态中存在强线性可解的选项正确性信号；赢家内容位置在最后一项处理后即刻可解，而输出符号在答案生成前才被表征；置换实验支持‘先选内容赢家、再绑定符号’的两阶段机制。

Conclusion: 语言模型执行MCQA时遵循两阶段机制：先在内容空间中识别正确选项，再将其路由或绑定至对应输出符号，表明推理与符号绑定是分离且有序的过程。

Abstract: Multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) is easy to evaluate but adds a meta-task: models must both solve the problem and output the symbol that *represents* the answer, conflating reasoning errors with symbol-binding failures. We study how language models implement MCQA internally using representational analyses (PCA, linear probes) as well as causal interventions. We find that option-boundary (newline) residual states often contain strong linearly decodable signals related to per-option correctness. Winner-identity probing reveals a two-stage progression: the winning *content position* becomes decodable immediately after the final option is processed, while the *output symbol* is represented closer to the answer emission position. Tests under symbol and content permutations support a two-stage mechanism in which models first select a winner in content space and then bind or route that winner to the appropriate symbol to emit.

Motivation: 现有安全研究主要关注隐式社会规范或纯文本场景，忽视了多模态文档中动态、用户定义的信息披露政策带来的挑战。

Method: 构建了面向真实报告的多模态文档策略保护基准Doc-PP，并提出结构化推理框架DVA（分解-验证-聚合），将推理过程与策略验证解耦。

Result: 实验表明DVA显著优于标准提示防御方法，能有效缓解因跨模态复杂推理导致的敏感信息泄露问题。

Conclusion: DVA为策略合规的文档理解提供了鲁棒基线，揭示并弥补了当前LVLM在策略执行中的关键安全缺口。

Abstract: The deployment of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for real-world document question answering is often constrained by dynamic, user-defined policies that dictate information disclosure based on context. While ensuring adherence to these explicit constraints is critical, existing safety research primarily focuses on implicit social norms or text-only settings, overlooking the complexities of multimodal documents. In this paper, we introduce Doc-PP (Document Policy Preservation Benchmark), a novel benchmark constructed from real-world reports requiring reasoning across heterogeneous visual and textual elements under strict non-disclosure policies. Our evaluation highlights a systemic Reasoning-Induced Safety Gap: models frequently leak sensitive information when answers must be inferred through complex synthesis or aggregated across modalities, effectively circumventing existing safety constraints. Furthermore, we identify that providing extracted text improves perception but inadvertently facilitates leakage. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose DVA (Decompose-Verify-Aggregation), a structural inference framework that decouples reasoning from policy verification. Experimental results demonstrate that DVA significantly outperforms standard prompting defenses, offering a robust baseline for policy-compliant document understanding

Motivation: 满足商业场景对细粒度、多语言、高鲁棒性ABSA模型的实际需求，弥补现有数据规模小、类别单一、跨语言性能差等不足。

Method: 构建超大规模真实+合成训练数据（达SemEval14的20倍）；扩展情感类别至5类（含mixed/unknown）；联合建模方面情感与整体文本情感；引入CoT微调与面向encoder-only模型的新型推理预训练；开发395M参数encoder与8B参数decoder架构。

Result: 在SemEval14上大幅刷新SOTA，准确率较GPT-4o和Claude 3.5 Sonnet高最多10个百分点；单个多语言模型在6种语言上保持87–91%准确率且不损害英文性能；发布涵盖92个领域的ABSA-mix基准。

Conclusion: Arctic-ABSA证明了高质量合成数据、细粒度情感建模与推理增强预训练对ABSA任务的有效性，为工业级多语言情感分析提供了新范式与实用工具。

Abstract: We introduce Arctic-ABSA, a collection of powerful models for real-life aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA). Our models are tailored to commercial needs, trained on a large corpus of public data alongside carefully generated synthetic data, resulting in a dataset 20 times larger than SemEval14. We extend typical ABSA models by expanding the number of sentiment classes from the standard three (positive, negative, neutral) to five, adding mixed and unknown classes, while also jointly predicting overall text sentiment and supporting multiple languages. We experiment with reasoning injection by fine-tuning on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) examples and introduce a novel reasoning pretraining technique for encoder-only models that significantly improves downstream fine-tuning and generalization. Our 395M-parameter encoder and 8B-parameter decoder achieve up to 10 percentage points higher accuracy than GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, while setting new state-of-the-art results on the SemEval14 benchmark. A single multilingual model maintains 87-91% accuracy across six languages without degrading English performance. We release ABSA-mix, a large-scale benchmark aggregating 17 public ABSA datasets across 92 domains.

Result: 在假新闻检测基准上RADAR取得86.98% ROC-AUC，显著优于带检索的通用大语言模型；消融实验表明检测端检索贡献最大增益，VAF和少样本示例对鲁棒训练至关重要。

Conclusion: RADAR通过检索增强与自然语言形式的对抗反馈实现了更鲁棒、可进化的假新闻检测，验证了将生成式对抗机制与检索技术结合的有效性。

Abstract: To efficiently combat the spread of LLM-generated misinformation, we present RADAR, a retrieval-augmented detector with adversarial refinement for robust fake news detection. Our approach employs a generator that rewrites real articles with factual perturbations, paired with a lightweight detector that verifies claims using dense passage retrieval. To enable effective co-evolution, we introduce verbal adversarial feedback (VAF). Rather than relying on scalar rewards, VAF issues structured natural-language critiques; these guide the generator toward more sophisticated evasion attempts, compelling the detector to adapt and improve. On a fake news detection benchmark, RADAR achieves 86.98% ROC-AUC, significantly outperforming general-purpose LLMs with retrieval. Ablation studies confirm that detector-side retrieval yields the largest gains, while VAF and few-shot demonstrations provide critical signals for robust training.

Motivation: 现有LLM评测基准数量激增，但缺乏系统评估这些基准自身质量的方法，亟需可靠的质量评估体系。

Method: 提出Benchmark^2框架，包含三个互补指标：(1)跨基准排名一致性；(2)可区分性分数；(3)能力对齐偏差。在15个基准、11个LLM、4个模型家族上开展广泛实验。

Conclusion: Benchmark^2为LLM基准质量评估提供了可量化、可操作的系统性方法，支持更高效、更可靠的模型评测。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of benchmarks for evaluating large language models (LLMs) has created an urgent need for systematic methods to assess benchmark quality itself. We propose Benchmark^2, a comprehensive framework comprising three complementary metrics: (1) Cross-Benchmark Ranking Consistency, measuring whether a benchmark produces model rankings aligned with peer benchmarks; (2) Discriminability Score, quantifying a benchmark's ability to differentiate between models; and (3) Capability Alignment Deviation, identifying problematic instances where stronger models fail but weaker models succeed within the same model family. We conduct extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks spanning mathematics, reasoning, and knowledge domains, evaluating 11 LLMs across four model families. Our analysis reveals significant quality variations among existing benchmarks and demonstrates that selective benchmark construction based on our metrics can achieve comparable evaluation performance with substantially reduced test sets.

Motivation: 市政会议纪要格式高度异构、自由叙述，难以自动化提取投票结果，而现有NLP任务和数据集缺乏对此类行政文本的支持。

Method: 提出VotIE信息抽取任务，基于CitiLink语料构建葡萄牙市政会议纪要基准；对比微调编码器（XLM-R-CRF）与少样本大语言模型在域内和跨市政场景下的性能。

Result: XLM-R-CRF在标准域内测试达93.2%宏F1，优于生成式方法；但在跨市政迁移中性能显著下降，而少样本LLM下降较小、鲁棒性更强；但其计算成本过高限制实用部署。

Conclusion: 轻量级微调编码器目前仍是大规模政务文本处理更实用的选择；作者开源了基准数据集、模型与评估框架，推动行政NLP可复现研究。

Abstract: Municipal meeting minutes record key decisions in local democratic processes. Unlike parliamentary proceedings, which typically adhere to standardized formats, they encode voting outcomes in highly heterogeneous, free-form narrative text that varies widely across municipalities, posing significant challenges for automated extraction. In this paper, we introduce VotIE (Voting Information Extraction), a new information extraction task aimed at identifying structured voting events in narrative deliberative records, and establish the first benchmark for this task using Portuguese municipal minutes, building on the recently introduced CitiLink corpus. Our experiments yield two key findings. First, under standard in-domain evaluation, fine-tuned encoders, specifically XLM-R-CRF, achieve the strongest performance, reaching 93.2\% macro F1, outperforming generative approaches. Second, in a cross-municipality setting that evaluates transfer to unseen administrative contexts, these models suffer substantial performance degradation, whereas few-shot LLMs demonstrate greater robustness, with significantly smaller declines in performance. Despite this generalization advantage, the high computational cost of generative models currently constrains their practicality. As a result, lightweight fine-tuned encoders remain a more practical option for large-scale, real-world deployment. To support reproducible research in administrative NLP, we publicly release our benchmark, trained models, and evaluation framework.

Motivation: 现有LLM驱动的辅导方案常使用简单提示生成的模拟学生进行训练和评估，但缺乏对学生模拟质量的保证或测量。

Method: 正式定义学生模拟任务，设计多维度评估指标（语言、行为、认知），并在真实数学辅导对话数据集上对提示策略、监督微调和偏好优化等方法进行自动与人工联合评估。

Result: 提示策略表现差；监督微调和偏好优化效果显著提升但仍有限；人工与自动评估结果一致。

Conclusion: 学生模拟是一个具有挑战性的任务，当前方法仍有较大改进空间，亟需未来研究。

Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) enable many new innovations in education. However, evaluating the effectiveness of new technology requires real students, which is time-consuming and hard to scale up. Therefore, many recent works on LLM-powered tutoring solutions have used simulated students for both training and evaluation, often via simple prompting. Surprisingly, little work has been done to ensure or even measure the quality of simulated students. In this work, we formally define the student simulation task, propose a set of evaluation metrics that span linguistic, behavioral, and cognitive aspects, and benchmark a wide range of student simulation methods on these metrics. We experiment on a real-world math tutoring dialogue dataset, where both automated and human evaluation results show that prompting strategies for student simulation perform poorly; supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization yield much better but still limited performance, motivating future work on this challenging task.

TL;DR: 本文提出SpeakerSleuth基准，评估大音频-语言模型（LALMs）在多轮对话中判断说话人一致性的能力，发现LALMs普遍存在重文本、轻声学的模态偏差，难以可靠检测声学不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大音频-语言模型（LALMs）作为语音生成质量评估判据的研究未覆盖其在多轮对话中判断说话人一致性的能力，这一能力对真实场景至关重要。

Method: 构建SpeakerSleuth基准，包含三项任务、1818个经人工验证的样本，覆盖四种数据集（合成与真实语音），控制声学难度；对9种主流LALMs进行系统评测。

Result: LALMs普遍难以可靠检测声学不一致性：部分模型过度预测不一致，部分过于宽松；难以定位问题语句；引入他人话语后性能显著下降，常忽略明显性别切换；但在音频匹配任务中表现较好，显示其具备基础声学判别能力。

Conclusion: LALMs存在显著模态偏差——优先依赖文本线索而忽视声学线索，揭示了构建可靠音频-语言评估判据所需解决的根本性模态不平衡问题。

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) as judges have emerged as a prominent approach for evaluating speech generation quality, yet their ability to assess speaker consistency across multi-turn conversations remains unexplored. We present SpeakerSleuth, a benchmark evaluating whether LALMs can reliably judge speaker consistency in multi-turn dialogues through three tasks reflecting real-world requirements. We construct 1,818 human-verified evaluation instances across four diverse datasets spanning synthetic and real speech, with controlled acoustic difficulty. Evaluating nine widely-used LALMs, we find that models struggle to reliably detect acoustic inconsistencies. For instance, given audio samples of the same speaker's turns, some models overpredict inconsistency, whereas others are overly lenient. Models further struggle to identify the exact turns that are problematic. When other interlocutors' turns are provided together, performance degrades dramatically as models prioritize textual coherence over acoustic cues, failing to detect even obvious gender switches for a speaker. On the other hand, models perform substantially better in choosing the audio that best matches the speaker among several acoustic variants, demonstrating inherent acoustic discrimination capabilities. These findings expose a significant bias in LALMs: they tend to prioritize text over acoustics, revealing fundamental modality imbalances that need to be addressed to build reliable audio-language judges.

### [171] [Analyzing and Improving Cross-lingual Knowledge Transfer for Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04036)
*David Stap*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This thesis investigates cross-lingual knowledge transfer in multilingual neural machine translation, focusing on improving robustness and generalization—especially for low-resource languages—through analyses of language similarity, retrieval-augmented training, auxiliary supervision, fine-tuning trade-offs, and language diversity effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multilingual MT systems face challenges in learning effective cross-lingual representations, especially for low-resource languages due to limited parallel data; understanding how knowledge transfers across languages requires studying interactions among representations, data availability, and training strategies.

Method: The work uses machine translation as a central testbed and employs analyses of language similarity, retrieval-augmented methods, auxiliary supervision, fine-tuning behavior in large language models, and controlled studies on language diversity and translation coverage during training.

Result: Key findings include: language similarity influences transfer effectiveness; retrieval and auxiliary supervision improve low-resource translation; fine-tuning can harm zero-shot or off-target performance; and greater language diversity and translation coverage enhance generalization and reduce off-target behavior.

Conclusion: Modeling choices and data composition critically shape multilingual learning; the insights support building more inclusive, robust, and resilient multilingual NLP systems.

Abstract: Multilingual machine translation systems aim to make knowledge accessible across languages, yet learning effective cross-lingual representations remains challenging. These challenges are especially pronounced for low-resource languages, where limited parallel data constrains generalization and transfer. Understanding how multilingual models share knowledge across languages requires examining the interaction between representations, data availability, and training strategies. In this thesis, we study cross-lingual knowledge transfer in neural models and develop methods to improve robustness and generalization in multilingual settings, using machine translation as a central testbed. We analyze how similarity between languages influences transfer, how retrieval and auxiliary supervision can strengthen low-resource translation, and how fine-tuning on parallel data can introduce unintended trade-offs in large language models. We further examine the role of language diversity during training and show that increasing translation coverage improves generalization and reduces off-target behavior. Together, this work highlights how modeling choices and data composition shape multilingual learning and offers insights toward more inclusive and resilient multilingual NLP systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为SaLAD的多模态安全基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在日常生活中对人类行为的安全影响；该基准包含2013个真实图像-文本样本，覆盖10类常见场景，并提出基于安全警告的评估框架；实验表明当前最优MLLMs在不安全查询上的安全响应率仅为57.2%，揭示其在识别日常危险行为方面的脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在人类生活中的广泛应用，其生成的不安全内容对人类行为构成现实威胁，亟需系统性评估其在真实生活场景中的安全风险。

Method: 构建了SaLAD多模态安全基准数据集（含2013个真实图像-文本样本、10类日常场景、平衡 unsafe 与 oversensitive 情况），并提出基于安全警告的评估框架，强调模型应提供明确、信息丰富的安全警告而非笼统拒绝。

Result: 在18个MLLMs上的评测显示，性能最优模型在不安全查询上的安全响应率仅57.2%；主流安全对齐方法在此基准下效果有限，暴露当前MLLMs在识别日常危险行为上的显著缺陷。

Conclusion: 现有MLLMs在真实多模态安全风险识别方面存在严重不足，SaLAD为推动更鲁棒、可解释、面向实际生活场景的安全评估与对齐研究提供了关键基础设施和新范式。

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) become an indispensable assistant in human life, the unsafe content generated by MLLMs poses a danger to human behavior, perpetually overhanging human society like a sword of Damocles. To investigate and evaluate the safety impact of MLLMs responses on human behavior in daily life, we introduce SaLAD, a multimodal safety benchmark which contains 2,013 real-world image-text samples across 10 common categories, with a balanced design covering both unsafe scenarios and cases of oversensitivity. It emphasizes realistic risk exposure, authentic visual inputs, and fine-grained cross-modal reasoning, ensuring that safety risks cannot be inferred from text alone. We further propose a safety-warning-based evaluation framework that encourages models to provide clear and informative safety warnings, rather than generic refusals. Results on 18 MLLMs demonstrate that the top-performing models achieve a safe response rate of only 57.2% on unsafe queries. Moreover, even popular safety alignment methods limit effectiveness of the models in our scenario, revealing the vulnerabilities of current MLLMs in identifying dangerous behaviors in daily life. Our dataset is available at https://github.com/xinyuelou/SaLAD.

*Prith Sharma,Austin Z. Henley*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种模块化提示优化框架（MPO），将提示划分为语义明确的固定部分（如系统角色、上下文、任务描述等），并利用批评模型生成各部分的文本梯度进行独立优化，从而提升小规模开源语言模型的推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动提示优化方法将提示视为整体文本块，难以定位错误、保留关键指令或控制提示膨胀；而小规模开源指令微调模型又高度依赖显式结构化提示。

Method: 提出模块化提示优化（MPO）框架，将提示建模为具有固定语义分段（如系统角色、上下文、任务描述、约束、输出格式）的结构化对象；使用批评语言模型为各段生成局部文本梯度，并通过去重整合更新，保持整体架构不变。

Result: 在ARC-Challenge和MMLU两个推理基准上，使用LLaMA-3 8B-Instruct与Mistral-7B-Instruct验证，MPO一致优于未调优结构化提示及TextGrad基线，显著提升准确率，且不修改模型参数或改变提示结构。

Conclusion: 在固定提示结构前提下，实施分段局部优化是一种有效、实用且可解释的提升小型开源语言模型推理能力的方法。

Abstract: Prompt quality plays a central role in controlling the behavior, reliability, and reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), particularly for smaller open-source instruction-tuned models that depend heavily on explicit structure. While recent work has explored automatic prompt optimization using textual gradients and self-refinement, most existing methods treat prompts as monolithic blocks of text, making it difficult to localize errors, preserve critical instructions, or prevent uncontrolled prompt growth. We introduce Modular Prompt Optimization (MPO), a schema-based prompt optimization framework that treats prompts as structured objects composed of fixed semantic sections, including system role, context, task description, constraints, and output format. MPO applies section-local textual gradients, generated by a critic language model, to refine each section independently while keeping the overall prompt schema fixed. Section updates are consolidated through de-duplication to reduce redundancy and interference between components, yielding an interpretable and robust optimization process. We evaluate MPO on two reasoning benchmarks, ARC-Challenge and MMLU, using LLaMA-3 8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct as solver models. Across both benchmarks and models, MPO consistently outperforms an untuned structured prompt and the TextGrad baseline, achieving substantial accuracy gains without modifying model parameters or altering prompt structure. These results demonstrate that maintaining a fixed prompt schema while applying localized, section-wise optimization is an effective and practical approach for improving reasoning performance in small open-source LMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成建模范式割裂（自回归用于文本、扩散用于图像），且掩码语言模型在多模态生成中面临对齐困难和训练不稳定问题。

Method: 提出CoM-DAD：1）用连续潜在扩散建模语义流形；2）用条件化的变率噪声调度下的离散吸收扩散生成token；3）引入随机混合模态传输策略实现跨模态对齐，无需强对比双编码器。

Result: 相比标准掩码建模，CoM-DAD展现出更优训练稳定性，并在文本-图像生成任务上建立新范式。

Conclusion: CoM-DAD为构建可扩展、真正统一的多模态生成系统提供了新路径，弥合了离散与连续生成范式的鸿沟。

Abstract: The bifurcation of generative modeling into autoregressive approaches for discrete data (text) and diffusion approaches for continuous data (images) hinders the development of truly unified multimodal systems. While Masked Language Models (MLMs) offer efficient bidirectional context, they traditionally lack the generative fidelity of autoregressive models and the semantic continuity of diffusion models. Furthermore, extending masked generation to multimodal settings introduces severe alignment challenges and training instability. In this work, we propose \textbf{CoM-DAD} (\textbf{Co}upled \textbf{M}anifold \textbf{D}iscrete \textbf{A}bsorbing \textbf{D}iffusion), a novel probabilistic framework that reformulates multimodal generation as a hierarchical dual-process. CoM-DAD decouples high-level semantic planning from low-level token synthesis. First, we model the semantic manifold via a continuous latent diffusion process; second, we treat token generation as a discrete absorbing diffusion process, regulated by a \textbf{Variable-Rate Noise Schedule}, conditioned on these evolving semantic priors. Crucially, we introduce a \textbf{Stochastic Mixed-Modal Transport} strategy that aligns disparate modalities without requiring heavy contrastive dual-encoders. Our method demonstrates superior stability over standard masked modeling, establishing a new paradigm for scalable, unified text-image generation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过在推理提示中嵌入可编程模块来引导知识图谱探索，从而减少大语言模型提示诱导幻觉的新框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了缓解大语言模型（LLMs）中的幻觉问题，特别是由提示引发的错误。

Method: 扩展链式知识蒸馏方法，嵌入可编程模块作为可执行代码于推理提示中，以在推理过程中利用外部结构化知识，并显式调控中间推理步骤。

Result: 在多个公开基准上使用GPT-4和LLaMA-3.3验证，HIT@1、HIT@3、HIT@5分别提升15.64%、13.38%、13.28%，多项设置下得分超95%。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效约束错误推理，在提升准确性的同时增强可解释性。

Abstract: To mitigate hallucinations in large language models (LLMs), we propose a framework that focuses on errors induced by prompts. Our method extends a chain-style knowledge distillation approach by incorporating a programmable module that guides knowledge graph exploration. This module is embedded as executable code within the reasoning prompt, allowing the model to leverage external structured knowledge during inference. Based on this design, we develop an enhanced distillation-based reasoning framework that explicitly regulates intermediate reasoning steps, resulting in more reliable predictions. We evaluate the proposed approach on multiple public benchmarks using GPT-4 and LLaMA-3.3. Experimental results show that code-guided reasoning significantly improves contextual modeling and reduces prompt-induced hallucinations. Specifically, HIT@1, HIT@3, and HIT@5 increase by 15.64%, 13.38%, and 13.28%, respectively, with scores exceeding 95% across several evaluation settings. These findings indicate that the proposed method effectively constrains erroneous reasoning while improving both accuracy and interpretability.

TL;DR: 本文提出SearchAttack方法，通过将有害语义外包给网络搜索，利用搜索结果重构恶意内容，从而对搜索增强型大语言模型进行红队测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当搜索引擎被用于有害任务时，其返回的直接包含有害信息的内容会绕过LLM的安全防护机制，因此作者将网络搜索识别为关键攻击面。

Method: SearchAttack将有害语义外包给网络搜索，仅保留查询骨架和碎片化线索，并通过结构化规则引导LLM重构检索内容以实现恶意目标。

Result: 大量实验表明，SearchAttack在攻击搜索增强型LLM方面表现出强大有效性，可用于负责任的漏洞评估。

Conclusion: 网络搜索是搜索增强型LLM的关键安全薄弱点，SearchAttack揭示了该类系统在现实场景中面临的新威胁，并为后续防御研究提供了依据。

Abstract: Recently, people have suffered and become increasingly aware of the unreliability gap in LLMs for open and knowledge-intensive tasks, and thus turn to search-augmented LLMs to mitigate this issue. However, when the search engine is triggered for harmful tasks, the outcome is no longer under the LLM's control. Once the returned content directly contains targeted, ready-to-use harmful takeaways, the LLM's safeguards cannot withdraw that exposure. Motivated by this dilemma, we identify web search as a critical attack surface and propose \textbf{\textit{SearchAttack}} for red-teaming. SearchAttack outsources the harmful semantics to web search, retaining only the query's skeleton and fragmented clues, and further steers LLMs to reconstruct the retrieved content via structural rubrics to achieve malicious goals. Extensive experiments are conducted to red-team the search-augmented LLMs for responsible vulnerability assessment. Empirically, SearchAttack demonstrates strong effectiveness in attacking these systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于归因的框架，利用滑动窗口下的层传导（layer conductance）分析短上下文语言模型中各层对输入位置的重要性分布，发现存在随深度增强的近因偏差和随深度减弱的首因偏差，并揭示了早期层偏好实词、后期层丧失词性区分能力的现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究未系统揭示位置偏差如何随模型深度和输入位置动态演化，也未剥离任务复杂度影响独立分析其特性。

Method: 提出基于归因的分析框架，采用滑动窗口下的层传导方法，量化各层对不同输入位置的重要性，构建层级别位置重要性分布图谱，并在词汇打乱等控制条件下验证其稳定性。

Result: 发现位置重要性分布具有架构特异性、输入稳定性与词汇无关性；呈现深度依赖的近因偏差增强与首因偏差减弱；早期层显著偏好实词，后期层该区分能力消失。

Conclusion: 位置偏差是语言模型内在结构化行为，具有深度分层特征和词性敏感性，需在模型设计与评估中显式建模与解耦。

Abstract: Language models often show a preference for using information from specific positions in the input regardless of semantic relevance. While positional bias has been studied in various contexts, from attention sinks to task performance degradation in long-context settings, prior work has not established how these biases evolve across individual layers and input positions, or how they vary independent of task complexity. We introduce an attribution-based framework to analyze positional effects in short-context language modeling. Using layer conductance with a sliding-window approach, we quantify how each layer distributes importance across input positions, yielding layer-wise positional importance profiles. We find that these profiles are architecture-specific, stable across inputs, and invariant to lexical scrambling. Characterizing these profiles, we find prominent recency bias that increases with depth and subtle primacy bias that diminishes through model depth. Beyond positional structure, we also show that early layers preferentially weight content words over function words across all positions, while later layers lose this word-type differentiation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当外部检索的上下文与大语言模型内部记忆知识冲突时，模型倾向于依赖内部知识而产生不忠实输出，影响实际部署效果。

Method: 提出ContextFocus方法，通过激活引导机制增强模型对输入上下文的关注，无需模型微调，仅在推理阶段引入轻微开销。

Result: 在ConFiQA基准上显著提升上下文忠实度，优于ContextDPO、COIECD及各类提示方法，并能与提示策略协同使用，在更大模型上依然有效。

Conclusion: ContextFocus是一种高效、鲁棒且通用的方法，可有效提升大语言模型在知识冲突场景下的上下文忠实性，同时保持生成流畅性与推理效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encode vast amounts of parametric knowledge during pre-training. As world knowledge evolves, effective deployment increasingly depends on their ability to faithfully follow externally retrieved context. When such evidence conflicts with the model's internal knowledge, LLMs often default to memorized facts, producing unfaithful outputs. In this work, we introduce ContextFocus, a lightweight activation steering approach that improves context faithfulness in such knowledge-conflict settings while preserving fluency and efficiency. Unlike prior approaches, our solution requires no model finetuning and incurs minimal inference-time overhead, making it highly efficient. We evaluate ContextFocus on the ConFiQA benchmark, comparing it against strong baselines including ContextDPO, COIECD, and prompting-based methods. Furthermore, we show that our method is complementary to prompting strategies and remains effective on larger models. Extensive experiments show that ContextFocus significantly improves contextual-faithfulness. Our results highlight the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of ContextFocus in improving contextual-faithfulness of LLM outputs.

TL;DR: 本文提出FLEx方法，利用少量自然语言解释示例来改进大语言模型在推理任务中的表现，无需修改模型权重，通过嵌入聚类选择代表性错误、验证解释有效性并生成提示前缀，在多个基准上显著优于思维链（CoT）提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型虽在多种任务中表现良好，但仍常重复犯错；人工收集大量高质量自然语言解释成本高，尤其依赖专家标注的领域。

Method: FLEx方法包括三步：1）基于嵌入的聚类选取代表性模型错误；2）验证对应自然语言解释能否纠正这些错误；3）将有效解释总结为推理时预置的提示前缀，引导模型避免同类错误，不更新模型权重。

Result: 在CounterBench、GSM8K和ReasonIF三个数据集上，FLEx持续优于思维链（CoT）提示，并最多减少CoT剩余错误的83%。

Conclusion: FLEx是一种高效、轻量、无需微调的提示增强方法，能显著提升语言模型推理准确性，尤其适用于难以获取大规模专家解释的场景。

Abstract: Language models have become effective at a wide range of tasks, from math problem solving to open-domain question answering. However, they still make mistakes, and these mistakes are often repeated across related queries. Natural language explanations can help correct these errors, but collecting them at scale may be infeasible, particularly in domains where expert annotators are required. To address this issue, we introduce FLEx ($\textbf{F}$ew-shot $\textbf{L}$anguage $\textbf{Ex}$planations), a method for improving model behavior using a small number of explanatory examples. FLEx selects representative model errors using embedding-based clustering, verifies that the associated explanations correct those errors, and summarizes them into a prompt prefix that is prepended at inference-time. This summary guides the model to avoid similar errors on new inputs, without modifying model weights. We evaluate FLEx on CounterBench, GSM8K, and ReasonIF. We find that FLEx consistently outperforms chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting across all three datasets and reduces up to 83\% of CoT's remaining errors.

Conclusion: RFC Bench揭示了现有模型在无参考推理上的关键缺陷，为提升金融虚假信息检测的可靠性提供了结构化测试平台。

Abstract: We introduce RFC Bench, a benchmark for evaluating large language models on financial misinformation under realistic news. RFC Bench operates at the paragraph level and captures the contextual complexity of financial news where meaning emerges from dispersed cues. The benchmark defines two complementary tasks: reference free misinformation detection and comparison based diagnosis using paired original perturbed inputs. Experiments reveal a consistent pattern: performance is substantially stronger when comparative context is available, while reference free settings expose significant weaknesses, including unstable predictions and elevated invalid outputs. These results indicate that current models struggle to maintain coherent belief states without external grounding. By highlighting this gap, RFC Bench provides a structured testbed for studying reference free reasoning and advancing more reliable financial misinformation detection in real world settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG面临检索召回率与LLM上下文长度限制之间的权衡瓶颈：检索过少易丢失关键信息，过多则稀释相关性并增加成本。

Method: 提出两阶段检索流程：第一阶段用LLM进行查询扩展以提高候选文档召回；第二阶段使用FlashRank reranker，基于相关性、新颖性、简洁性和交叉编码器证据等加权指标，在token预算约束下动态选择最优证据子集。

Result: 该方法显著提升了RAG系统的答案准确率、事实忠实性（faithfulness）和计算效率。

Conclusion: 所提框架是一种通用、可扩展的RAG优化方案，有效缓解了检索与上下文限制间的矛盾。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) couples a retriever with a large language model (LLM) to ground generated responses in external evidence. While this framework enhances factuality and domain adaptability, it faces a key bottleneck: balancing retrieval recall with limited LLM context. Retrieving too few passages risks missing critical context, while retrieving too many overwhelms the prompt window, diluting relevance and increasing cost.
  We propose a two-stage retrieval pipeline that integrates LLM-driven query expansion to improve candidate recall and FlashRank, a fast marginal-utility reranker that dynamically selects an optimal subset of evidence under a token budget. FlashRank models document utility as a weighted combination of relevance, novelty, brevity, and cross-encoder evidence. Together, these modules form a generalizable solution that increases answer accuracy, faithfulness, and computational efficiency.

Motivation: Existing sequential recommendation models, including diffusion-based ones, rely on ID-based embeddings that lack semantic meaning, leading to poor performance for new users and long-tail items.

Method: LLMDiRec combines collaborative signals from ID embeddings with semantic representations from LLMs via a dynamic fusion mechanism and a multi-task objective to align both views within a diffusion-based recommendation framework.

TL;DR: This survey explores how Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) improve retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for visually rich documents (VRDs), categorizing approaches into three roles and analyzing their trade-offs and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visually rich documents (VRDs) pose challenges for RAG due to layout-dependent semantics, unreliable OCR, and scattered evidence in figures and tables.

Method: The paper surveys and categorizes existing MLLM-based VRD retrieval methods into three roles—Modality-Unifying Captioners, Multimodal Embedders, and End-to-End Representers—and compares them across multiple dimensions including granularity, fidelity, latency, index size, and compatibility with reranking and grounding.

Result: A structured taxonomy of MLLM roles in VRD retrieval is established, along with comparative analysis of their strengths, weaknesses, and practical deployment considerations.

Conclusion: MLLMs offer promising pathways for VRD-aware RAG, but trade-offs exist among accuracy, efficiency, and flexibility; future work should focus on adaptive units, model compression, and standardized evaluation.

Abstract: Visually rich documents (VRDs) challenge retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with layout-dependent semantics, brittle OCR, and evidence spread across complex figures and structured tables. This survey examines how Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are being used to make VRD retrieval practical for RAG. We organize the literature into three roles: Modality-Unifying Captioners, Multimodal Embedders, and End-to-End Representers. We compare these roles along retrieval granularity, information fidelity, latency and index size, and compatibility with reranking and grounding. We also outline key trade-offs and offer some practical guidance on when to favor each role. Finally, we identify promising directions for future research, including adaptive retrieval units, model size reduction, and the development of evaluation methods.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed success of sequential modeling, generative recommender, and large language model for recommendation. Though the scaling law has been validated for sequential models, it showed inefficiency in computational capacity when considering real-world applications like recommendation, due to the non-linear(quadratic) increasing nature of the transformer model. To improve the efficiency of the sequential model, we introduced a novel approach to sequential recommendation that leverages personalization techniques to enhance efficiency and performance. Our method compresses long user interaction histories into learnable tokens, which are then combined with recent interactions to generate recommendations. This approach significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining high recommendation accuracy. Our method could be applied to existing transformer based recommendation models, e.g., HSTU and HLLM. Extensive experiments on multiple sequential models demonstrate its versatility and effectiveness.

### [186] [STELLA: Self-Reflective Terminology-Aware Framework for Building an Aerospace Information Retrieval Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03496)
*Bongmin Kim*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出了STELLA框架及对应的航空航天领域专用信息检索基准STELLA，通过术语感知的合成查询生成（分术语一致型TCQ与术语无关型TAQ）实现对嵌入模型词法与语义匹配能力的解耦评估，并结合CoD与自反思方法提升查询质量，验证了大解码器嵌入模型在语义理解上优势明显，而BM25等词法方法在需精确匹配技术术语的任务中仍具竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏反映航空航天领域术语特征和用户查询意图的公开信息检索（IR）基准。

Method: 提出STELLA框架，基于NASA技术报告服务器（NTRS）构建基准：包含文档版面检测、段落切分、术语词典构建、合成查询生成（TCQ/TAQ两类）、跨语言扩展；融合Chain-of-Density（CoD）与自反思方法优化查询生成，并采用混合跨语言扩展策略。

Result: 在STELLA基准上评估7种嵌入模型，发现大解码器类嵌入模型语义理解最强，而BM25等词法方法在需精确匹配技术术语时仍极具竞争力。

Conclusion: STELLA提供了可复现、可靠的航空航天领域IR嵌入模型评估基础，推动该领域检索技术发展。

Abstract: Tasks in the aerospace industry heavily rely on searching and reusing large volumes of technical documents, yet there is no public information retrieval (IR) benchmark that reflects the terminology- and query-intent characteristics of this domain. To address this gap, this paper proposes the STELLA (Self-Reflective TErminoLogy-Aware Framework for BuiLding an Aerospace Information Retrieval Benchmark) framework. Using this framework, we introduce the STELLA benchmark, an aerospace-specific IR evaluation set constructed from NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) documents via a systematic pipeline that comprises document layout detection, passage chunking, terminology dictionary construction, synthetic query generation, and cross-lingual extension. The framework generates two types of queries: the Terminology Concordant Query (TCQ), which includes the terminology verbatim to evaluate lexical matching, and the Terminology Agnostic Query (TAQ), which utilizes the terminology's description to assess semantic matching. This enables a disentangled evaluation of the lexical and semantic matching capabilities of embedding models. In addition, we combine Chain-of-Density (CoD) and the Self-Reflection method with query generation to improve quality and implement a hybrid cross-lingual extension that reflects real user querying practices. Evaluation of seven embedding models on the STELLA benchmark shows that large decoder-based embedding models exhibit the strongest semantic understanding, while lexical matching methods such as BM25 remain highly competitive in domains where exact lexical matching technical term is crucial. The STELLA benchmark provides a reproducible foundation for reliable performance evaluation and improvement of embedding models in aerospace-domain IR tasks. The STELLA benchmark can be found in https://huggingface.co/datasets/telepix/STELLA.

### [187] [Shielded RecRL: Explanation Generation for Recommender Systems without Ranking Degradation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03608)
*Ansh Tiwari,Ayush Chauhan*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Shielded RecRL 是一种强化学习方法，用于为推荐系统生成个性化解释，同时保持原有排序性能不变；它采用双塔架构，通过带 KL 约束的 PPO 微调仅 0.4% 参数的 LLM（LoRA），在 Amazon Books 数据集上提升 CTR 22.5%，且不损害排序效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于 RLHF 的推荐方法直接优化排序，易损害原始推荐性能；需在提供高质量个性化解释的同时，保障推荐系统的准确性与稳定性。

Method: 提出双塔架构：固定原推荐模型（ranking tower），单独训练语言模型（explanation tower）；设计融合长度、相关性与连贯性的复合奖励函数；使用 KL 约束的 PPO 算法，结合 LoRA 对大语言模型进行高效微调（仅 0.4% 参数可训练）。

Result: 在 Amazon Books（约 5 万条幻想/浪漫类交互）上，相对点击率（CTR）提升 22.5%（达 1.225 倍基线），且排序行为几乎无变化；消融实验证明梯度屏蔽策略与奖励设计能有效平衡解释质量与策略漂移。

Conclusion: Shielded RecRL 成功实现了推荐系统中用户侧体验（个性化解释）与核心能力（排序精度）的协同增强，为可解释推荐提供了兼顾性能与可控性的新范式。

Abstract: We introduce Shielded RecRL, a reinforcement learning approach to generate personalized explanations for recommender systems without sacrificing the system's original ranking performance. Unlike prior RLHF-based recommender methods that directly optimize item rankings, our two-tower architecture keeps the recommender's ranking model intact while a language model learns to produce helpful explanations. We design a composite reward signal combining explanation length, content relevance, and coherence, and apply proximal policy optimization (PPO) with a KL-divergence constraint to fine-tune a large language model with only 0.4% of its parameters trainable via LoRA adapters. In experiments on an Amazon Books dataset (approximately 50K interactions in the fantasy and romance genres), Shielded RecRL improved the relative click-through rate (CTR) by 22.5% (1.225x over baseline) while keeping the recommender's item-ranking behavior virtually unchanged. An extensive ablation study confirms that our gradient shielding strategy and reward design effectively balance explanation quality and policy drift. Our results demonstrate that Shielded RecRL enhances user-facing aspects of recommendations through rich, personalized explanations without degrading core recommendation accuracy.

### [188] [Perception-Aware Bias Detection for Query Suggestions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03730)
*Fabian Haak,Philipp Schaer*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种感知感知的偏见检测方法，用于改进针对人物相关搜索的查询建议中的系统性主题偏见检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 查询建议中的偏见问题尚未得到足够关注，且其稀疏性和缺乏上下文元数据使其难以检测；同时，用户对查询建议的感知短暂而潜意识，需要更符合人类感知的评估指标。

Method: 在Bonart等人提出的偏见检测流程基础上，引入感知感知（perception-aware）指标，以更好地捕捉用户实际可察觉的系统性主题偏见。

Result: 实验分析证实，新引入的感知感知指标能更准确反映用户实际可察觉的偏见，提升了偏见检测结果的真实性与实用性。

Conclusion: 该增强型检测流程通过融合感知建模，显著提升了对人物相关搜索查询建议中系统性主题偏见的识别能力，使检测结果更贴近用户真实感知。

Abstract: Bias in web search has been in the spotlight of bias detection research for quite a while. At the same time, little attention has been paid to query suggestions in this regard. Awareness of the problem of biased query suggestions has been raised. Likewise, there is a rising need for automatic bias detection approaches. This paper adds on the bias detection pipeline for bias detection in query suggestions of person-related search developed by Bonart et al. \cite{Bonart_2019a}. The sparseness and lack of contextual metadata of query suggestions make them a difficult subject for bias detection. Furthermore, query suggestions are perceived very briefly and subliminally. To overcome these issues, perception-aware metrics are introduced. Consequently, the enhanced pipeline is able to better detect systematic topical bias in search engine query suggestions for person-related searches. The results of an analysis performed with the developed pipeline confirm this assumption. Due to the perception-aware bias detection metrics, findings produced by the pipeline can be assumed to reflect bias that users would discern.

### [189] [Bridging OLAP and RAG: A Multidimensional Approach to the Design of Corpus Partitioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03748)
*Dario Maio,Stefano Rizzi*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合语义聚类与多维划分的大型RAG系统设计新思路，并引入‘维度事实模型（DFM）’作为概念框架，以提升大规模检索的可解释性、可控性与鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工业级RAG系统虽通过近似最近邻搜索、混合索引和元数据过滤实现高效扩展，但其基于相似性的底层分片缺乏概念依据，多维信息（如时间、组织上下文）被零散、非结构化地使用，导致检索过程不可控、难解释。

Method: 提出维度事实模型（DFM），将RAG语料库的划分建模为事实（文本块）、维度（如时间、部门）、层次结构与粒度的组合；支持基于维度的分层路由与受控回退机制。

Result: DFM使RAG检索从黑箱式相似匹配转变为可治理、确定性的流程，提升了在元数据不全情况下的鲁棒性，并自然支持层级化查询路由。

Conclusion: 将OLAP风格的多维建模思想引入RAG架构是可行且必要的，DFM为构建可解释、可治理、可扩展的大规模RAG系统提供了原则性指导，呼吁该方向的进一步研究。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are increasingly deployed on large-scale document collections, often comprising millions of documents and tens of millions of text chunks. In industrial-scale retrieval platforms, scalability is typically addressed through horizontal sharding and a combination of Approximate Nearest-Neighbor search, hybrid indexing, and optimized metadata filtering. Although effective from an efficiency perspective, these mechanisms rely on bottom-up, similarity-driven organization and lack a conceptual rationale for corpus partitioning. In this paper, we claim that the design of large-scale RAG systems may benefit from the combination of two orthogonal strategies: semantic clustering, which optimizes locality in embedding space, and multidimensional partitioning, which governs where retrieval should occur based on conceptual dimensions such as time and organizational context. Although such dimensions are already implicitly present in current systems, they are used in an ad hoc and poorly structured manner. We propose the Dimensional Fact Model (DFM) as a conceptual framework to guide the design of multidimensional partitions for RAG corpora. The DFM provides a principled way to reason about facts, dimensions, hierarchies, and granularity in retrieval-oriented settings. This framework naturally supports hierarchical routing and controlled fallback strategies, ensuring that retrieval remains robust even in the presence of incomplete metadata, while transforming the search process from a 'black-box' similarity matching into a governable and deterministic workflow. This work is intended as a position paper; its goal is to bridge the gap between OLAP-style multidimensional modeling and modern RAG architectures, and to stimulate further research on principled, explainable, and governable retrieval strategies at scale.

### [190] [Unleashing the Potential of Neighbors: Diffusion-based Latent Neighbor Generation for Session-based Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03903)
*Yuhan Yang,Jie Zou,Guojia An,Jiwei Wei,Yang Yang,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出DiffSBR模型，通过检索增强与自增强两种扩散模块生成高质量隐式邻居会话，以缓解会话推荐中的数据稀疏问题，显著提升推荐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于邻居会话的会话推荐方法仅依赖显式观测到的会话，忽略了兴趣空间中潜在但相关（未被直接观测）的邻居会话，未能充分挖掘邻居信息潜力。

Method: 提出DiffSBR模型，包含两个扩散模块：1）检索增强扩散模块，利用检索到的邻居作为引导信号约束并重构隐式邻居分布，并设计检索器与生成器协同训练机制；2）自增强扩散模块，通过对比学习将当前会话的多模态信号注入以显式引导隐式邻居生成；最后用生成的隐式邻居增强会话表征。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上的大量实验表明，DiffSBR能生成有效的隐式邻居，并在多个指标上优于当前最优基线方法。

Conclusion: DiffSBR通过建模和生成潜在邻居会话，有效缓解了会话推荐中的数据稀疏问题，验证了隐式邻居建模对提升推荐性能的重要价值。

Abstract: Session-based recommendation aims to predict the next item that anonymous users may be interested in, based on their current session interactions. Recent studies have demonstrated that retrieving neighbor sessions to augment the current session can effectively alleviate the data sparsity issue and improve recommendation performance. However, existing methods typically rely on explicitly observed session data, neglecting latent neighbors - not directly observed but potentially relevant within the interest space - thereby failing to fully exploit the potential of neighbor sessions in recommendation. To address the above limitation, we propose a novel model of diffusion-based latent neighbor generation for session-based recommendation, named DiffSBR. Specifically, DiffSBR leverages two diffusion modules, including retrieval-augmented diffusion and self-augmented diffusion, to generate high-quality latent neighbors. In the retrieval-augmented diffusion module, we leverage retrieved neighbors as guiding signals to constrain and reconstruct the distribution of latent neighbors. Meanwhile, we adopt a training strategy that enables the retriever to learn from the feedback provided by the generator. In the self-augmented diffusion module, we explicitly guide the generation of latent neighbors by injecting the current session's multi-modal signals through contrastive learning. After obtaining the generated latent neighbors, we utilize them to enhance session representations for improving session-based recommendation. Extensive experiments on four public datasets show that DiffSBR generates effective latent neighbors and improves recommendation performance against state-of-the-art baselines.

### [191] [Revisiting Continuous-Time Trajectory Estimation via Gaussian Processes and the Magnus Expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03360)
*Timothy Barfoot,Cedric Le Gentil,Sven Lilge*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Magnus展开的全局高斯过程（GP）先验方法，用于李群上的连续时间轨迹估计，克服了以往局部GP方法缺乏理论优雅性的缺点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往在李群上进行连续时间轨迹估计时，采用的是多个局部线性时不变SDE核的高斯过程，虽实用但缺乏理论统一性和优雅性；本文旨在提供一种更优雅、更通用的全局解决方案。

Method: 采用Magnus展开推导适用于李群的全局高斯过程先验，该先验由线性时变（LTV）随机微分方程（SDE）驱动，并与连续时间状态估计框架结合。

Result: 实现了李群上连续时间轨迹估计的全局GP建模，数值实验对比验证了其相较于局部GP方法的有效性与优势。

Conclusion: 基于Magnus展开的全局GP方法为李群上的连续时间估计提供了更理论严谨、更通用的建模范式，提升了模型的统一性与可解释性。

Abstract: Continuous-time state estimation has been shown to be an effective means of (i) handling asynchronous and high-rate measurements, (ii) introducing smoothness to the estimate, (iii) post hoc querying the estimate at times other than those of the measurements, and (iv) addressing certain observability issues related to scanning-while-moving sensors. A popular means of representing the trajectory in continuous time is via a Gaussian process (GP) prior, with the prior's mean and covariance functions generated by a linear time-varying (LTV) stochastic differential equation (SDE) driven by white noise. When the state comprises elements of Lie groups, previous works have resorted to a patchwork of local GPs each with a linear time-invariant SDE kernel, which while effective in practice, lacks theoretical elegance. Here we revisit the full LTV GP approach to continuous-time trajectory estimation, deriving a global GP prior on Lie groups via the Magnus expansion, which offers a more elegant and general solution. We provide a numerical comparison between the two approaches and discuss their relative merits.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种基于Lidar Teach and Repeat技术的月面自主导航与货物运输系统，并在加拿大航天局类地地形场进行了为期两周的实地测试，成功验证了其在恶劣环境下的精准停靠、自主循迹及货物收发能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 未来月球表面作业需要自动化车辆在已知地点间运输货物，且需精确导航以避开自然障碍、人造设施和危险阴影，并能以高精度自主泊车完成货物交接。

Method: 采用Lidar Teach and Repeat技术，先以半自主遥控模式驾驶一吨级路径飞行样机 rover 构建安全路径网络；随后在载货状态下全自动重复执行该路径网络。

Result: 系统在加拿大航天局类地地形场的两周期间完成了模拟月球作业，成功实现货物自主采集与交付，闭环定位精度足以支持车辆对准并拾取货物。

Conclusion: Lidar Teach and Repeat 是一种适用于月面 cargo transport 的高效、鲁棒且即插即用的自主导航方案，已在真实类地环境中得到充分验证。

Abstract: In future operations on the lunar surface, automated vehicles will be required to transport cargo between known locations. Such vehicles must be able to navigate precisely in safe regions to avoid natural hazards, human-constructed infrastructure, and dangerous dark shadows. Rovers must be able to park their cargo autonomously within a small tolerance to achieve a successful pickup and delivery. In this field test, Lidar Teach and Repeat provides an ideal autonomy solution for transporting cargo in this way. A one-tonne path-to-flight rover was driven in a semi-autonomous remote-control mode to create a network of safe paths. Once the route was taught, the rover immediately repeated the entire network of paths autonomously while carrying cargo. The closed-loop performance is accurate enough to align the vehicle to the cargo and pick it up. This field report describes a two-week deployment at the Canadian Space Agency's Analogue Terrain, culminating in a simulated lunar operation to evaluate the system's capabilities. Successful cargo collection and delivery were demonstrated in harsh environmental conditions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了零知识任务规划（ZKTP）问题，即在缺乏任务特定知识的情况下规划动作序列，并提出一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的方法，通过自然语言指令分解、行为树（BT）生成与在线修正来实现自动化行为生成，在AI2-THOR中验证了其有效性。


<details>

Motivation: 解决在没有任务特定先验知识的前提下进行有效任务规划的问题，提升智能体在开放环境中的泛化与自适应能力。

Method: 利用大语言模型将自然语言指令分解为子任务，生成可执行的行为树；执行中出错时，通过LLM在线调整行为树，形成闭环优化。

Result: 在AI2-THOR仿真环境中，该方法相比依赖任务特定知识的基线方法显著提升了整体任务完成性能。

Conclusion: 大语言模型可在零知识前提下支撑任务分解、行为树生成与动态修正，为无预设任务知识的自动化行为生成提供了可行且鲁棒的框架。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce and formalize the Zero-Knowledge Task Planning (ZKTP) problem, i.e., formulating a sequence of actions to achieve some goal without task-specific knowledge. Additionally, we present a first investigation and approach for ZKTP that leverages a large language model (LLM) to decompose natural language instructions into subtasks and generate behavior trees (BTs) for execution. If errors arise during task execution, the approach also uses an LLM to adjust the BTs on-the-fly in a refinement loop. Experimental validation in the AI2-THOR simulator demonstrate our approach's effectiveness in improving overall task performance compared to alternative approaches that leverage task-specific knowledge. Our work demonstrates the potential of LLMs to effectively address several aspects of the ZKTP problem, providing a robust framework for automated behavior generation with no task-specific setup.

Motivation: 现有无人机野火监测方法依赖简化仿真器和监督式感知流程，缺乏在物理真实火灾环境中具身交互的智能体，难以应对极端视觉退化、快速动态变化及真实数据稀缺等挑战。

Method: 构建基于USGS DEM地形、LANDFIRE燃料数据和半物理火蔓延模型的高保真野火数字孪生；在其中训练双视角感知的PPO强化学习智能体，并由CLIP风格VLM提供 wildfire-specific 语义对齐得分，作为势函数形式的奖励塑形信号。

Conclusion: FIRE-VLM证明了VLM引导的RL在复杂、物理真实灾害环境中的可行性与优越性，为具身智能体在低数据、高不确定性野外场景中的部署提供了新范式。

Abstract: Wildfire monitoring demands autonomous systems capable of reasoning under extreme visual degradation, rapidly evolving physical dynamics, and scarce real-world training data. Existing UAV navigation approaches rely on simplified simulators and supervised perception pipelines, and lack embodied agents interacting with physically realistic fire environments. We introduce FIRE-VLM, the first end-to-end vision-language model (VLM) guided reinforcement learning (RL) framework trained entirely within a high-fidelity, physics-grounded wildfire digital twin. Built from USGS Digital Elevation Model (DEM) terrain, LANDFIRE fuel inventories, and semi-physical fire-spread solvers, this twin captures terrain-induced runs, wind-driven acceleration, smoke plume occlusion, and dynamic fuel consumption. Within this environment, a PPO agent with dual-view UAV sensing is guided by a CLIP-style VLM. Wildfire-specific semantic alignment scores, derived from a single prompt describing active fire and smoke plumes, are integrated as potential-based reward shaping signals. Our contributions are: (1) a GIS-to-simulation pipeline for constructing wildfire digital twins; (2) a VLM-guided RL agent for UAV firefront tracking; and (3) a wildfire-aware reward design that combines physical terms with VLM semantics. Across five digital-twin evaluation tasks, our VLM-guided policy reduces time-to-detection by up to 6 times, increases time-in-FOV, and is, to our knowledge, the first RL-based UAV wildfire monitoring system demonstrated in kilometer-scale, physics-grounded digital-twin fires.

Motivation: 传统越野轨迹规划方法适应动态环境能力差，且现有视觉-语言-动作（VLA）模型存在空间感知不足和推理不稳定问题。

Method: 设计视觉提示模块（利用语义分割掩码增强空间理解）和链式思维自一致性（COT-SC）推理策略（通过多路径推理抑制异常值影响）。

Conclusion: OFF-EMMA有效提升了越野自主驾驶中端到端轨迹规划的准确性与鲁棒性。

Abstract: Efficient trajectory planning in off-road terrains presents a formidable challenge for autonomous vehicles, often necessitating complex multi-step pipelines. However, traditional approaches exhibit limited adaptability in dynamic environments. To address these limitations, this paper proposes OFF-EMMA, a novel end-to-end multimodal framework designed to overcome the deficiencies of insufficient spatial perception and unstable reasoning in visual-language-action (VLA) models for off-road autonomous driving scenarios. The framework explicitly annotates input images through the design of a visual prompt block and introduces a chain-of-thought with self-consistency (COT-SC) reasoning strategy to enhance the accuracy and robustness of trajectory planning. The visual prompt block utilizes semantic segmentation masks as visual prompts, enhancing the spatial understanding ability of pre-trained visual-language models for complex terrains. The COT- SC strategy effectively mitigates the error impact of outliers on planning performance through a multi-path reasoning mechanism. Experimental results on the RELLIS-3D off-road dataset demonstrate that OFF-EMMA significantly outperforms existing methods, reducing the average L2 error of the Qwen backbone model by 13.3% and decreasing the failure rate from 16.52% to 6.56%.

Abstract: Robot musicians require precise control to obtain proper note accuracy, sound quality, and musical expression. Performance of string instruments, such as violin and cello, presents a significant challenge due to the precise control required over bow angle and pressure to produce the desired sound. While prior robotic cellists focus on accurate bowing trajectories, these works often rely on expensive motion capture techniques, and fail to sightread music in a human-like way.
  We propose a novel end-to-end MIDI score to robotic motion pipeline which converts musical input directly into collision-aware bowing motions for a UR5e robot cellist. Through use of Universal Robot Freedrive feature, our robotic musician can achieve human-like sound without the need for motion capture. Additionally, this work records live joint data via Real-Time Data Exchange (RTDE) as the robot plays, providing labeled robotic playing data from a collection of five standard pieces to the research community. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in comparison to human performers, we introduce the Musical Turing Test, in which a collection of 132 human participants evaluate our robot's performance against a human baseline. Human reference recordings are also released, enabling direct comparison for future studies. This evaluation technique establishes the first benchmark for robotic cello performance. Finally, we outline a residual reinforcement learning methodology to improve upon baseline robotic controls, highlighting future opportunities for improved string-crossing efficiency and sound quality.

Abstract: Most locomotion methods for humanoid robots focus on leg-based gaits, yet natural bipeds frequently rely on hands, knees, and elbows to establish additional contacts for stability and support in complex environments. This paper introduces Locomotion Beyond Feet, a comprehensive system for whole-body humanoid locomotion across extremely challenging terrains, including low-clearance spaces under chairs, knee-high walls, knee-high platforms, and steep ascending and descending stairs. Our approach addresses two key challenges: contact-rich motion planning and generalization across diverse terrains. To this end, we combine physics-grounded keyframe animation with reinforcement learning. Keyframes encode human knowledge of motor skills, are embodiment-specific, and can be readily validated in simulation or on hardware, while reinforcement learning transforms these references into robust, physically accurate motions. We further employ a hierarchical framework consisting of terrain-specific motion-tracking policies, failure recovery mechanisms, and a vision-based skill planner. Real-world experiments demonstrate that Locomotion Beyond Feet achieves robust whole-body locomotion and generalizes across obstacle sizes, obstacle instances, and terrain sequences.

*Lina Zhu,Jiyu Cheng,Yuehu Liu,Wei Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种双注意力异构图神经网络（DA-HGNN），结合深度强化学习，用于多机器人协同区域搜索中动态平衡探索未知区域与覆盖特定目标（如待救援目标）两大任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法受限于同质图表示，难以建模和平衡探索与覆盖两类不同任务。

Method: 构建包含机器人节点、前沿节点和兴趣点节点及其历史状态的异构图；设计关系感知注意力（捕捉机器人与候选目标间时空关系）和类型感知注意力（分别计算机器人对前沿和兴趣点的关联性，解耦探索与覆盖任务）；采用深度强化学习训练。

Result: 在iGibson仿真器中基于Gibson和MatterPort3D数据集的3D交互场景实验表明，该方法具有更优的可扩展性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: DA-HGNN通过异构图建模与双注意力机制，有效解耦并协同优化探索与覆盖任务，显著提升了多机器人协同搜索性能。

Abstract: In multi-robot collaborative area search, a key challenge is to dynamically balance the two objectives of exploring unknown areas and covering specific targets to be rescued. Existing methods are often constrained by homogeneous graph representations, thus failing to model and balance these distinct tasks. To address this problem, we propose a Dual-Attention Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (DA-HGNN) trained using deep reinforcement learning. Our method constructs a heterogeneous graph that incorporates three entity types: robot nodes, frontier nodes, and interesting nodes, as well as their historical states. The dual-attention mechanism comprises the relational-aware attention and type-aware attention operations. The relational-aware attention captures the complex spatio-temporal relationships among robots and candidate goals. Building on this relational-aware heterogeneous graph, the type-aware attention separately computes the relevance between robots and each goal type (frontiers vs. points of interest), thereby decoupling the exploration and coverage from the unified tasks. Extensive experiments conducted in interactive 3D scenarios within the iGibson simulator, leveraging the Gibson and MatterPort3D datasets, validate the superior scalability and generalization capability of the proposed approach.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了PointWorld，一种大型预训练3D世界模型，将状态与动作统一在共享的3D空间中表示为3D点流，能根据RGB-D图像和机器人动作命令预测像素级3D位移；该模型在大规模真实与仿真数据上训练，支持跨形态泛化，并可实时集成于MPC框架，在无微调、无演示条件下实现多种真实机器人操作任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能从视觉和自身动作预判3D世界响应，而机器人同样需要这种能力以实现通用操控；现有方法常受限于特定机器人形态的动作空间表示，缺乏对物理几何的直接建模与跨形态泛化能力。

Method: 提出PointWorld模型，将状态（RGB-D图像）与动作（低层命令）统一编码为3D点流（per-pixel 3D displacements）；构建涵盖单臂Franka与双臂人形机器人的200万轨迹、500小时真实+仿真数据集；系统研究骨干网络、动作表征、学习目标、部分可观测性、数据混合与领域迁移等关键设计因素。

Result: PointWorld实现0.1秒实时推理，可在MPC中部署；单个预训练模型在真实Franka机器人上无需微调或演示，仅凭单张野外拍摄图像即可完成刚体推动、可变形/铰接物体操作及工具使用。

Conclusion: 以3D点流统一表征状态与动作是构建可扩展、跨形态、物理感知的3D世界模型的有效范式；大规模多源数据与系统化消融为未来大尺度3D世界建模提供了关键设计原则。

Abstract: Humans anticipate, from a glance and a contemplated action of their bodies, how the 3D world will respond, a capability that is equally vital for robotic manipulation. We introduce PointWorld, a large pre-trained 3D world model that unifies state and action in a shared 3D space as 3D point flows: given one or few RGB-D images and a sequence of low-level robot action commands, PointWorld forecasts per-pixel displacements in 3D that respond to the given actions. By representing actions as 3D point flows instead of embodiment-specific action spaces (e.g., joint positions), this formulation directly conditions on physical geometries of robots while seamlessly integrating learning across embodiments. To train our 3D world model, we curate a large-scale dataset spanning real and simulated robotic manipulation in open-world environments, enabled by recent advances in 3D vision and simulated environments, totaling about 2M trajectories and 500 hours across a single-arm Franka and a bimanual humanoid. Through rigorous, large-scale empirical studies of backbones, action representations, learning objectives, partial observability, data mixtures, domain transfers, and scaling, we distill design principles for large-scale 3D world modeling. With a real-time (0.1s) inference speed, PointWorld can be efficiently integrated in the model-predictive control (MPC) framework for manipulation. We demonstrate that a single pre-trained checkpoint enables a real-world Franka robot to perform rigid-body pushing, deformable and articulated object manipulation, and tool use, without requiring any demonstrations or post-training and all from a single image captured in-the-wild.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文探讨了进化机器人学中形态与控制协同优化的挑战，提出结合代际完全替换和生命周期内学习来提升种群多样性并保持性能，并强调了评估指标（如函数评估 vs. 进化代数）对结论的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决进化机器人中形态与控制器协同优化时因控制器适应滞后导致新设计难以进入种群的问题，以及进化过程中种群多样性下降的问题。

Method: 将生命周期内学习（intra-life learning）与全代际替换（full generational replacement）相结合，在进化过程中为每个个体增加控制器在线优化环节，并采用无精英保留的完全替换策略以维持多样性。

Result: 该组合方法在显著提升种群多样性的同时，未牺牲整体性能；且发现基于函数评估与基于进化代数的性能度量可能导致不同研究结论。

Conclusion: 生命周期内学习与全代际替换可协同改善进化机器人的多样性-性能权衡；评估视角的选择对理解学习在形态进化中的作用至关重要。

Abstract: Evolutionary Robotics offers the possibility to design robots to solve a specific task automatically by optimizing their morphology and control together. However, this co-optimization of body and control is challenging, because controllers need some time to adapt to the evolving morphology - which may make it difficult for new and promising designs to enter the evolving population. A solution to this is to add intra-life learning, defined as an additional controller optimization loop, to each individual in the evolving population. A related problem is the lack of diversity often seen in evolving populations as evolution narrows the search down to a few promising designs too quickly. This problem can be mitigated by implementing full generational replacement, where offspring robots replace the whole population. This solution for increasing diversity usually comes at the cost of lower performance compared to using elitism. In this work, we show that combining such generational replacement with intra-life learning can increase diversity while retaining performance. We also highlight the importance of performance metrics when studying learning in morphologically evolving robots, showing that evaluating according to function evaluations versus according to generations of evolution can give different conclusions.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出在进化机器人学中利用贝叶斯优化与样本继承（拉马克式遗传）提升控制器优化效率，在低学习预算下显著提升形态-控制协同进化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法为每个新机器人形态从头优化控制器，计算开销大；而实际中控制器学习预算往往受限，需更高效利用历史经验。

Method: 采用贝叶斯优化进行控制器优化，并引入两种样本继承机制：(1) 将父代样本作为先验直接迁移；(2) 在子代形态上重新评估父代最优样本；对比无继承基线。

Result: 重评估策略效果最优，先验迁移次之但均优于无继承；继承尤其利于与父代形态相似的子代；环境挑战性越高，所获步态越稳定。

Conclusion: 样本继承可有效补偿单代低学习预算的不足，通过跨代积累适应性知识提升整体进化效率，为资源受限下的进化机器人设计提供可行路径。

Abstract: In evolutionary robotics, robot morphologies are designed automatically using evolutionary algorithms. This creates a body-brain optimization problem, where both morphology and control must be optimized together. A common approach is to include controller optimization for each morphology, but starting from scratch for every new body may require a high controller learning budget. We address this by using Bayesian optimization for controller optimization, exploiting its sample efficiency and strong exploration capabilities, and using sample inheritance as a form of Lamarckian inheritance. Under a deliberately low controller learning budget for each morphology, we investigate two types of sample inheritance: (1) transferring all the parent's samples to the offspring to be used as prior without evaluating them, and (2) reevaluating the parent's best samples on the offspring. Both are compared to a baseline without inheritance. Our results show that reevaluation performs best, with prior-based inheritance also outperforming no inheritance. Analysis reveals that while the learning budget is too low for a single morphology, generational inheritance compensates for this by accumulating learned adaptations across generations. Furthermore, inheritance mainly benefits offspring morphologies that are similar to their parents. Finally, we demonstrate the critical role of the environment, with more challenging environments resulting in more stable walking gaits. Our findings highlight that inheritance mechanisms can boost performance in evolutionary robotics without needing large learning budgets, offering an efficient path toward more capable robot design.

Conclusion: 该工作是构建下一代主动式安全保障框架的重要一步，揭示了集成主动后备机制的潜力与挑战。

Abstract: Ensuring the functional safety of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) requires motion planning modules that not only operate within strict real-time constraints but also maintain controllability in case of system faults. Existing safeguarding concepts, such as Online Verification (OV), provide safety layers that detect infeasible planning outputs. However, they lack an active mechanism to ensure safe operation in the event that the main planner fails. This paper presents a first step toward an active safety extension for fail-operational Autonomous Driving (AD). We deploy a lightweight sampling-based trajectory planner on an automotive-grade, embedded platform running a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS). The planner continuously computes trajectories under constrained computational resources, forming the foundation for future emergency planning architectures. Experimental results demonstrate deterministic timing behavior with bounded latency and minimal jitter, validating the feasibility of trajectory planning on safety-certifiable hardware. The study highlights both the potential and the remaining challenges of integrating active fallback mechanisms as an integral part of next-generation safeguarding frameworks.

Motivation: 为软体机器人和交互环境开发大面积、柔性、响应快速且低功耗的触觉传感器，克服传统周期性扫描式触觉传感的带宽、功耗与延时瓶颈。

Result: 在4620 mm²探测面积上，95%双视角可见按压的定位RMSE为4.66 mm；极端下采样后平均误差仅增至9.33 mm，85%按压仍可有效定位；检测延迟分布特征宽度为31 ms。

Conclusion: 该事件驱动触觉系统兼具高空间精度、低延迟、强稀疏鲁棒性与低功耗潜力，适用于未来软体机器人及资源受限的交互传感场景。

Abstract: This paper presents a neuromorphic, event-driven tactile sensing system for soft, large-area skin, based on the Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) integrated with a flexible silicone optical waveguide skin. Instead of repetitively scanning embedded photoreceivers, this design uses a stereo vision setup comprising two DVS cameras looking sideways through the skin. Such a design produces events as changes in brightness are detected, and estimates press positions on the 2D skin surface through triangulation, utilizing Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to find the center of mass of contact events resulting from pressing actions. The system is evaluated over a 4620 mm2 probed area of the skin using a meander raster scan. Across 95 % of the presses visible to both cameras, the press localization achieved a Root-Mean-Squared Error (RMSE) of 4.66 mm. The results highlight the potential of this approach for wide-area flexible and responsive tactile sensors in soft robotics and interactive environments. Moreover, we examined how the system performs when the amount of event data is strongly reduced. Using stochastic down-sampling, the event stream was reduced to 1/1024 of its original size. Under this extreme reduction, the average localization error increased only slightly (from 4.66 mm to 9.33 mm), and the system still produced valid press localizations for 85 % of the trials. This reduction in pass rate is expected, as some presses no longer produce enough events to form a reliable cluster for triangulation. These results show that the sensing approach remains functional even with very sparse event data, which is promising for reducing power consumption and computational load in future implementations. The system exhibits a detection latency distribution with a characteristic width of 31 ms.

Conclusion: 将技能感知与反事实因果推理嵌入VLM，并结合具身技能执行，可有效赋能机器人完成需环境改造的交互式导航任务，为VLM向具身智能演进提供新范式。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in robotic planning. However, they typically function as semantic reasoners, lacking an intrinsic understanding of the specific robot's physical capabilities. This limitation is particularly critical in interactive navigation, where robots must actively modify cluttered environments to create traversable paths. Existing VLM-based navigators are predominantly confined to passive obstacle avoidance, failing to reason about when and how to interact with objects to clear blocked paths. To bridge this gap, we propose Counterfactual Interactive Navigation via Skill-aware VLM (CoINS), a hierarchical framework that integrates skill-aware reasoning and robust low-level execution. Specifically, we fine-tune a VLM, named InterNav-VLM, which incorporates skill affordance and concrete constraint parameters into the input context and grounds them into a metric-scale environmental representation. By internalizing the logic of counterfactual reasoning through fine-tuning on the proposed InterNav dataset, the model learns to implicitly evaluate the causal effects of object removal on navigation connectivity, thereby determining interaction necessity and target selection. To execute the generated high-level plans, we develop a comprehensive skill library through reinforcement learning, specifically introducing traversability-oriented strategies to manipulate diverse objects for path clearance. A systematic benchmark in Isaac Sim is proposed to evaluate both the reasoning and execution aspects of interactive navigation. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that CoINS significantly outperforms representative baselines, achieving a 17\% higher overall success rate and over 80\% improvement in complex long-horizon scenarios compared to the best-performing baseline

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出Residual Semantic Steering (RSS)框架，通过解耦物理可操作性与语义执行，提升视觉-语言-动作（VLA）模型在语言扰动下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA模型虽在通用机器人控制中表现优异，但对语言扰动极为脆弱，存在‘模态坍缩’现象——强视觉先验压制稀疏语言信号，导致模型过度依赖指令表层措辞而忽略语义意图。

Method: 提出RSS概率框架，包含两项理论创新：(1) 蒙特卡洛句法融合，利用大语言模型进行分布式语义后验近似；(2) 残差可操作性引导，采用双流解码机制显式分离语言的因果影响，减去视觉可操作性先验。

Result: 理论分析表明RSS能最大化动作与意图间的互信息并抑制视觉干扰；实验在多个操作基准上验证其达到语言扰动下最先进的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RSS有效缓解了VLA模型中的模态坍缩问题，显著提升了语言理解的语义泛化能力与鲁棒性，为构建真正意图驱动的机器人控制系统提供了新范式。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generalized robotic control; however, they remain notoriously brittle to linguistic perturbations. We identify a critical ``modality collapse'' phenomenon where strong visual priors overwhelm sparse linguistic signals, causing agents to overfit to specific instruction phrasings while ignoring the underlying semantic intent. To address this, we propose \textbf{Residual Semantic Steering (RSS)}, a probabilistic framework that disentangles physical affordance from semantic execution. RSS introduces two theoretical innovations: (1) \textbf{Monte Carlo Syntactic Integration}, which approximates the true semantic posterior via dense, LLM-driven distributional expansion, and (2) \textbf{Residual Affordance Steering}, a dual-stream decoding mechanism that explicitly isolates the causal influence of language by subtracting the visual affordance prior. Theoretical analysis suggests that RSS effectively maximizes the mutual information between action and intent while suppressing visual distractors. Empirical results across diverse manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that RSS achieves state-of-the-art robustness, maintaining performance even under adversarial linguistic perturbations.

Conclusion: CLAP为利用海量人类视频数据提升机器人具身智能提供了新范式，解决了视觉纠缠与数据稀缺双重挑战，推动了通用VLA模型向实际部署迈进。

Abstract: Generalist Vision-Language-Action models are currently hindered by the scarcity of robotic data compared to the abundance of human video demonstrations. Existing Latent Action Models attempt to leverage video data but often suffer from visual entanglement, capturing noise rather than manipulation skills. To address this, we propose Contrastive Latent Action Pretraining (CLAP), a framework that aligns the visual latent space from videos with a proprioceptive latent space from robot trajectories. By employing contrastive learning, CLAP maps video transitions onto a quantized, physically executable codebook. Building on this representation, we introduce a dual-formulation VLA framework offering both CLAP-NTP, an autoregressive model excelling at instruction following and object generalization, and CLAP-RF, a Rectified Flow-based policy designed for high-frequency, precise manipulation. Furthermore, we propose a Knowledge Matching (KM) regularization strategy to mitigate catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CLAP significantly outperforms strong baselines, enabling the effective transfer of skills from human videos to robotic execution.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为Wow-wo-val的Embodied Turing Test基准，用于评估视频基础模型作为具身智能世界模型的感知保真度与现实鲁棒性；实验表明现有模型在长时序规划和物理一致性上表现较差，且执行成功率极低，凸显了世界模型在具身AI中亟需系统性评测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频基础模型被越来越多地用作具身AI中的预测性世界模型，但其生成泛化能力（是否保持人类可感知的保真度）和现实鲁棒性（能否作为真实具身智能体的通用先验）仍缺乏系统验证。

Method: 构建了基于609段机器人操作数据的Wow-wo-val基准，涵盖感知、规划、预测、泛化与执行五大核心能力，并设计含22项指标的综合评估协议；同时提出逆动力学模型（IDM）图灵测试来量化模型在真实世界中的执行准确性。

Result: 模型在长时序规划得分仅17.27，物理一致性最高仅68.02；IDM图灵测试中多数模型成功率为≈0%，而WoW达40.74%；整体评分与人类偏好Pearson相关性>0.93。

Conclusion: 当前视频基础模型作为世界模型存在显著感知—现实鸿沟，亟需像Wow-wo-val这样的标准化基准推动其向具身部署演进。

Abstract: As world models gain momentum in Embodied AI, an increasing number of works explore using video foundation models as predictive world models for downstream embodied tasks like 3D prediction or interactive generation. However, before exploring these downstream tasks, video foundation models still have two critical questions unanswered: (1) whether their generative generalization is sufficient to maintain perceptual fidelity in the eyes of human observers, and (2) whether they are robust enough to serve as a universal prior for real-world embodied agents. To provide a standardized framework for answering these questions, we introduce the Embodied Turing Test benchmark: WoW-World-Eval (Wow,wo,val). Building upon 609 robot manipulation data, Wow-wo-val examines five core abilities, including perception, planning, prediction, generalization, and execution. We propose a comprehensive evaluation protocol with 22 metrics to assess the models' generation ability, which achieves a high Pearson Correlation between the overall score and human preference (>0.93) and establishes a reliable foundation for the Human Turing Test. On Wow-wo-val, models achieve only 17.27 on long-horizon planning and at best 68.02 on physical consistency, indicating limited spatiotemporal consistency and physical reasoning. For the Inverse Dynamic Model Turing Test, we first use an IDM to evaluate the video foundation models' execution accuracy in the real world. However, most models collapse to $\approx$ 0% success, while WoW maintains a 40.74% success rate. These findings point to a noticeable gap between the generated videos and the real world, highlighting the urgency and necessity of benchmarking World Model in Embodied AI.

Abstract: Emergency vehicles require rapid passage through congested traffic, yet existing strategies fail to adapt to dynamic conditions. We propose a novel hierarchical graph neural network (GNN)-based multi-agent reinforcement learning framework to coordinate connected vehicles for emergency corridor formation. Our approach uses a high-level planner for global strategy and low-level controllers for trajectory execution, utilizing graph attention networks to scale with variable agent counts. Trained via Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO), the system reduces emergency vehicle travel time by 28.3% compared to baselines and 44.6% compared to uncoordinated traffic in simulations. The design achieves near-zero collision rates (0.3%) while maintaining 81% of background traffic efficiency. Ablation and generalization studies confirm the framework's robustness across diverse scenarios. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining GNNs with hierarchical learning for intelligent transportation systems.

Abstract: Many embedded devices operate under resource constraints and in dynamic environments, requiring local decision-making capabilities. Enabling devices to make independent decisions in such environments can improve the responsiveness of the system and reduce the dependence on constant external control. In this work, we integrate an autonomous agent, programmed using AgentSpeak, with a small two-wheeled robot that explores a maze using its own decision-making and sensor data. Experimental results show that the agent successfully solved the maze in 59 seconds using 287 reasoning cycles, with decision phases taking less than one millisecond. These results indicate that the reasoning process is efficient enough for real-time execution on resource-constrained hardware. This integration demonstrates how high-level agent-based control can be applied to resource-constrained embedded systems for autonomous operation.

Motivation: 现有分布式MAPF与MARL方法在协作性和感知能力上不足，难以适应多样环境条件，尤其在部分可观测场景下易出现死锁和可扩展性差的问题。

Method: 提出基于Q-learning的MARL框架PC2P：1）动态图拓扑驱动的三阶段个性化通信机制（选择-生成-聚合）；2）融合静态空间约束与动态占用变化的本地人群感知模块；3）基于专家指导的区域化死锁破解策略。

Conclusion: PC2P通过增强通信、感知与死锁处理能力，显著提升了分布式MAPF在复杂、动态、部分可观测环境中的协同决策性能与鲁棒性。

Abstract: Distributed Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) integrated with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has emerged as a prominent research focus, enabling real-time cooperative decision-making in partially observable environments through inter-agent communication. However, due to insufficient collaborative and perceptual capabilities, existing methods are inadequate for scaling across diverse environmental conditions. To address these challenges, we propose PC2P, a novel distributed MAPF method derived from a Q-learning-based MARL framework. Initially, we introduce a personalized-enhanced communication mechanism based on dynamic graph topology, which ascertains the core aspects of ``who" and ``what" in interactive process through three-stage operations: selection, generation, and aggregation. Concurrently, we incorporate local crowd perception to enrich agents' heuristic observation, thereby strengthening the model's guidance for effective actions via the integration of static spatial constraints and dynamic occupancy changes. To resolve extreme deadlock issues, we propose a region-based deadlock-breaking strategy that leverages expert guidance to implement efficient coordination within confined areas. Experimental results demonstrate that PC2P achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art distributed MAPF methods in varied environments. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of each module for overall performance.

Abstract: This paper formalises the literature on emerging design patterns and paradigms for Large Language Model (LLM)-enabled multi-agent systems (MAS), evaluating their practical utility across various domains. We define key architectural components, including agent orchestration, communication mechanisms, and control-flow strategies, and demonstrate how these enable rapid development of modular, domain-adaptive solutions. Three real-world case studies are tested in controlled, containerised pilots in telecommunications security, national heritage asset management, and utilities customer service automation. Initial empirical results show that, for these case studies, prototypes were delivered within two weeks and pilot-ready solutions within one month, suggesting reduced development overhead compared to conventional approaches and improved user accessibility. However, findings also reinforce limitations documented in the literature, including variability in LLM behaviour that leads to challenges in transitioning from prototype to production maturity. We conclude by outlining critical research directions for improving reliability, scalability, and governance in MAS architectures and the further work needed to mature MAS design patterns to mitigate the inherent challenges.

Abstract: Chromatographic separation technology has been widely applied in pharmaceutical, chemical, and food industries due to its high efficiency. However, traditional human-dependent chromatographic process development faces challenges such as reliance on expert experience, long development cycles, and labor intensity. ChromR, a large language model (LLM)-driven platform for chromatographic process design and optimization, is presented in this work. The platform integrates ChromLLM, a domain-specific LLM trained for chromatography, along with a multi-agent system and an automated chromatographic experimental device. The multi-agent system comprises four agents: domain knowledge answering, experimental design, experimental execution, and data analysis. ChromR enables automatic completion of the entire workflow-including initial process parameter recommendation, experimental design, automated execution, data analysis, and multi-objective optimization. By utilizing ChromR, dependency on expert knowledge is effectively reduced, while labor input and development time are significantly decreased. Chromatographic purification of the extract of Ginkgo biloba leaf (EGBL) was selected as a case study. ChromR successfully developed a chromatographic process within one week that meets multiple objectives, including fraction quality and production efficiency, reducing development time to approximately one-seventh of that required by the conventional paradigm. An intelligent, automated, and universally applicable new paradigm was established for chromatographic process development.

Conclusion: 隐性通信在LLM多智能体系统中可自发涌现并有效支撑协调，其有效性依赖于博弈结构、通信限制与智能体特性。

Abstract: LLMs-based agents increasingly operate in multi-agent environments where strategic interaction and coordination are required. While existing work has largely focused on individual agents or on interacting agents sharing explicit communication, less is known about how interacting agents coordinate implicitly. In particular, agents may engage in covert communication, relying on indirect or non-linguistic signals embedded in their actions rather than on explicit messages. This paper presents a game-theoretic study of covert communication in LLM-driven multi-agent systems. We analyse interactions across four canonical game-theoretic settings under different communication regimes, including explicit, restricted, and absent communication. Considering heterogeneous agent personalities and both one-shot and repeated games, we characterise when covert signals emerge and how they shape coordination and strategic outcomes.

Abstract: This study highlights the potential of image-based reinforcement learning methods for addressing swarm-related tasks. In multi-agent reinforcement learning, effective policy learning depends on how agents sense, interpret, and process inputs. Traditional approaches often rely on handcrafted feature extraction or raw vector-based representations, which limit the scalability and efficiency of learned policies concerning input order and size. In this work we propose an image-based reinforcement learning method for decentralized control of a multi-agent system, where observations are encoded as structured visual inputs that can be processed by Neural Networks, extracting its spatial features and producing novel decentralized motion control rules. We evaluate our approach on a multi-agent convergence task of agents with limited-range and bearing-only sensing that aim to keep the swarm cohesive during the aggregation. The algorithm's performance is evaluated against two benchmarks: an analytical solution proposed by Bellaiche and Bruckstein, which ensures convergence but progresses slowly, and VariAntNet, a neural network-based framework that converges much faster but shows medium success rates in hard constellations. Our method achieves high convergence, with a pace nearly matching that of VariAntNet. In some scenarios, it serves as the only practical alternative.

Abstract: Despite rich safety alignment strategies, large language models (LLMs) remain highly susceptible to jailbreak attacks, which compromise safety guardrails and pose serious security risks. Existing detection methods mainly detect jailbreak status relying on jailbreak templates present in the training data. However, few studies address the more realistic and challenging zero-shot jailbreak detection setting, where no jailbreak templates are available during training. This setting better reflects real-world scenarios where new attacks continually emerge and evolve. To address this challenge, we propose a layer-wise, module-wise, and token-wise amplification framework that progressively magnifies internal feature discrepancies between benign and jailbreak prompts. We uncover safety-relevant layers, identify specific modules that inherently encode zero-shot discriminative signals, and localize informative safety tokens. Building upon these insights, we introduce ALERT (Amplification-based Jailbreak Detector), an efficient and effective zero-shot jailbreak detector that introduces two independent yet complementary classifiers on amplified representations. Extensive experiments on three safety benchmarks demonstrate that ALERT achieves consistently strong zero-shot detection performance. Specifically, (i) across all datasets and attack strategies, ALERT reliably ranks among the top two methods, and (ii) it outperforms the second-best baseline by at least 10% in average Accuracy and F1-score, and sometimes by up to 40%.

Abstract: Node classification is a fundamental problem in information retrieval with many real-world applications, such as community detection in social networks, grouping articles published online and product categorization in e-commerce. Zero-shot node classification in text-attributed graphs (TAGs) presents a significant challenge, particularly due to the absence of labeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel Zero-shot Prompt Tuning (ZPT) framework to address this problem by leveraging a Universal Bimodal Conditional Generator (UBCG). Our approach begins with pre-training a graph-language model to capture both the graph structure and the associated textual descriptions of each node. Following this, a conditional generative model is trained to learn the joint distribution of nodes in both graph and text modalities, enabling the generation of synthetic samples for each class based solely on the class name. These synthetic node and text embeddings are subsequently used to perform continuous prompt tuning, facilitating effective node classification in a zero-shot setting. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating that our framework performs better than existing state-of-the-art baselines. We also provide ablation studies to validate the contribution of the bimodal generator. The code is provided at: https://github.com/Sethup123/ZPT.

Abstract: News recommender systems are increasingly driven by black-box models, offering little transparency for editorial decision-making. In this work, we introduce a transparent recommender system that uses fuzzy neural networks to learn human-readable rules from behavioral data for predicting article clicks. By extracting the rules at configurable thresholds, we can control rule complexity and thus, the level of interpretability. We evaluate our approach on two publicly available news datasets (i.e., MIND and EB-NeRD) and show that we can accurately predict click behavior compared to several established baselines, while learning human-readable rules. Furthermore, we show that the learned rules reveal news consumption patterns, enabling editors to align content curation goals with target audience behavior.

Abstract: The deployment of transformer-based models on resource-constrained edge devices represents a critical challenge in enabling real-time artificial intelligence applications. This comprehensive survey examines lightweight transformer architectures specifically designed for edge deployment, analyzing recent advances in model compression, quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation techniques. We systematically review prominent lightweight variants including MobileBERT, TinyBERT, DistilBERT, EfficientFormer, EdgeFormer, and MobileViT, providing detailed performance benchmarks on standard datasets such as GLUE, SQuAD, ImageNet-1K, and COCO. Our analysis encompasses current industry adoption patterns across major hardware platforms (NVIDIA Jetson, Qualcomm Snapdragon, Apple Neural Engine, ARM architectures), deployment frameworks (TensorFlow Lite, ONNX Runtime, PyTorch Mobile, CoreML), and optimization strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that modern lightweight transformers can achieve 75-96% of full-model accuracy while reducing model size by 4-10x and inference latency by 3-9x, enabling deployment on devices with as little as 2-5W power consumption. We identify sparse attention mechanisms, mixed-precision quantization (INT8/FP16), and hardware-aware neural architecture search as the most effective optimization strategies. Novel findings include memory-bandwidth bottleneck analysis revealing 15-40M parameter models achieve optimal hardware utilization (60-75% efficiency), quantization sweet spots for different model types, and comprehensive energy efficiency profiling across edge platforms. We establish real-time performance boundaries and provide a practical 6-step deployment pipeline achieving 8-12x size reduction with less than 2% accuracy degradation.

Abstract: We report a case study of four end-to-end attempts to autonomously generate ML research papers using a pipeline of six LLM agents mapped to stages of the scientific workflow. Of these four, three attempts failed during implementation or evaluation. One completed the pipeline and was accepted to Agents4Science 2025, an experimental inaugural venue that required AI systems as first authors, passing both human and multi-AI review. From these attempts, we document six recurring failure modes: bias toward training data defaults, implementation drift under execution pressure, memory and context degradation across long-horizon tasks, overexcitement that declares success despite obvious failures, insufficient domain intelligence, and weak scientific taste in experimental design. We conclude by discussing four design principles for more robust AI-scientist systems, implications for autonomous scientific discovery, and we release all prompts, artifacts, and outputs at https://github.com/Lossfunk/ai-scientist-artefacts-v1

Abstract: On-policy reinforcement learning (RL), particularly Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), has become the dominant paradigm for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). While policy ratio clipping stabilizes training, this heuristic hard constraint incurs a fundamental cost: it indiscriminately truncates gradients from high-return yet high-divergence actions, suppressing rare but highly informative "eureka moments" in complex reasoning. Moreover, once data becomes slightly stale, hard clipping renders it unusable, leading to severe sample inefficiency. In this work, we revisit the trust-region objective in policy optimization and show that explicitly constraining the \emph{variance (second central moment) of the policy ratio} provides a principled and smooth relaxation of hard clipping. This distributional constraint stabilizes policy updates while preserving gradient signals from valuable trajectories. Building on this insight, we propose $R^2VPO$ (Ratio-Variance Regularized Policy Optimization), a novel primal-dual framework that supports stable on-policy learning and enables principled off-policy data reuse by dynamically reweighting stale samples rather than discarding them. We extensively evaluate $R^2VPO$ on fine-tuning state-of-the-art LLMs, including DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and the openPangu-Embedded series (1B and 7B), across challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Experimental results show that $R^2VPO$ consistently achieves superior asymptotic performance, with average relative gains of up to 17% over strong clipping-based baselines, while requiring approximately 50% fewer rollouts to reach convergence. These findings establish ratio-variance control as a promising direction for improving both stability and data efficiency in RL-based LLM alignment.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong potential for radiology report generation, yet their clinical translation is hindered by architectural heterogeneity and the prevalence of factual hallucinations. Standard supervised fine-tuning often fails to strictly align linguistic outputs with visual evidence, while existing reinforcement learning approaches struggle with either prohibitive computational costs or limited exploration. To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive framework for self-consistent radiology report generation. First, we conduct a systematic evaluation to identify optimal vision encoder and LLM backbone configurations for medical imaging. Building on this foundation, we introduce a novel "Reason-then-Summarize" architecture optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This framework restructures generation into two distinct components: a think block for detailed findings and an answer block for structured disease labels. By utilizing a multi-dimensional composite reward function, we explicitly penalize logical discrepancies between the generated narrative and the final diagnosis. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-CXR benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in clinical efficacy metrics and significantly reduces hallucinations compared to strong supervised baselines.

Conclusion: 双曲几何是建模EEG层级结构的有效范式；HEEGNet通过混合架构与新型域自适应策略，成功学习到更具泛化性的域不变双曲表示，为鲁棒EEG解码提供了新思路。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces facilitate direct communication with a computer, enabling promising applications in human-computer interactions. However, their utility is currently limited because EEG decoding often suffers from poor generalization due to distribution shifts across domains (e.g., subjects). Learning robust representations that capture underlying task-relevant information would mitigate these shifts and improve generalization. One promising approach is to exploit the underlying hierarchical structure in EEG, as recent studies suggest that hierarchical cognitive processes, such as visual processing, can be encoded in EEG. While many decoding methods still rely on Euclidean embeddings, recent work has begun exploring hyperbolic geometry for EEG. Hyperbolic spaces, regarded as the continuous analogue of tree structures, provide a natural geometry for representing hierarchical data. In this study, we first empirically demonstrate that EEG data exhibit hyperbolicity and show that hyperbolic embeddings improve generalization. Motivated by these findings, we propose HEEGNet, a hybrid hyperbolic network architecture to capture the hierarchical structure in EEG and learn domain-invariant hyperbolic embeddings. To this end, HEEGNet combines both Euclidean and hyperbolic encoders and employs a novel coarse-to-fine domain adaptation strategy. Extensive experiments on multiple public EEG datasets, covering visual evoked potentials, emotion recognition, and intracranial EEG, demonstrate that HEEGNet achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Wildfires are highly imbalanced natural hazards in both space and severity, making the prediction of extreme events particularly challenging. In this work, we introduce the first ordinal classification framework for forecasting wildfire severity levels directly aligned with operational decision-making in France. Our study investigates the influence of loss-function design on the ability of neural models to predict rare yet critical high-severity fire occurrences. We compare standard cross-entropy with several ordinal-aware objectives, including the proposed probabilistic TDeGPD loss derived from a truncated discrete exponentiated Generalized Pareto Distribution. Through extensive benchmarking over multiple architectures and real operational data, we show that ordinal supervision substantially improves model performance over conventional approaches. In particular, the Weighted Kappa Loss (WKLoss) achieves the best overall results, with more than +0.1 IoU gain on the most extreme severity classes while maintaining competitive calibration quality. However, performance remains limited for the rarest events due to their extremely low representation in the dataset. These findings highlight the importance of integrating both severity ordering, data imbalance considerations, and seasonality risk into wildfire forecasting systems. Future work will focus on incorporating seasonal dynamics and uncertainty information into training to further improve the reliability of extreme-event prediction.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms represent a fundamental paradigm shift in neural network architectures, enabling models to selectively focus on relevant portions of input sequences through learned weighting functions. This monograph provides a comprehensive and rigorous mathematical treatment of attention mechanisms, encompassing their theoretical foundations, computational properties, and practical implementations in contemporary deep learning systems. Applications in natural language processing, computer vision, and multimodal learning demonstrate the versatility of attention mechanisms. We examine language modeling with autoregressive transformers, bidirectional encoders for representation learning, sequence-to-sequence translation, Vision Transformers for image classification, and cross-modal attention for vision-language tasks. Empirical analysis reveals training characteristics, scaling laws that relate performance to model size and computation, attention pattern visualizations, and performance benchmarks across standard datasets. We discuss the interpretability of learned attention patterns and their relationship to linguistic and visual structures. The monograph concludes with a critical examination of current limitations, including computational scalability, data efficiency, systematic generalization, and interpretability challenges.

### [226] [LUT-KAN: Segment-wise LUT Quantization for Fast KAN Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03332)
*Oleksandr Kuznetsov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了LUT-KAN，一种针对Kolmogorov–Arnold网络（KAN）的分段查找表（LUT）编译与量化方法，通过int8/uint8量化和线性插值提升CPU推理速度，同时保持高精度，并提供可复现的推理契约。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KAN因使用可学习的一元样条函数而具备高精度与可解释性，但其CPU推理开销大，且难以应用标准量化工具链；现有实现缺乏明确、可复现的推理行为定义（如边界处理与越界策略）。

Method: 提出LUT-KAN：将每条边上的B样条函数转换为分段LUT，采用对称int8或非对称uint8量化加线性插值；定义显式推理契约（含边界约定与OOB策略）；采用‘诚实基线’评估法（统一后端如NumPy/Numba），分离表示优化与向量化/JIT效应；系统评估不同LUT分辨率（16–128）与量化方案。

Result: 在DoS攻击检测（CICIDS2017）案例中，LUT-KAN使F1仅下降<0.0002，CPU推理延迟分别降低12×（NumPy）和10×（Numba），内存开销约增加10×（L=64）；提供了OOB鲁棒性矩阵与多种子统计指标（均值±标准差）。

Conclusion: LUT-KAN是一种高效、可复现、可部署的KAN加速方案，在精度损失极小前提下显著提升CPU推理速度，填补了KAN在边缘/轻量级场景落地的关键技术空白。

Abstract: Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KAN) replace scalar weights by learnable univariate functions, often implemented with B-splines. This design can be accurate and interpretable, but it makes inference expensive on CPU because each layer requires many spline evaluations. Standard quantization toolchains are also hard to apply because the main computation is not a matrix multiply but repeated spline basis evaluation. This paper introduces LUT-KAN, a segment-wise lookup-table (LUT) compilation and quantization method for PyKAN-style KAN layers. LUT-KAN converts each edge function into a per-segment LUT with affine int8/uint8 quantization and linear interpolation. The method provides an explicit and reproducible inference contract, including boundary conventions and out-of-bounds (OOB) policies. We propose an ``honest baseline'' methodology for speed evaluation: B-spline evaluation and LUT evaluation are compared under the same backend optimization (NumPy vs NumPy and Numba vs Numba), which separates representation gains from vectorization and JIT effects. Experiments include controlled sweeps over LUT resolution L in 16, 32, 64, 128 and two quantization schemes (symmetric int8 and asymmetric uint8). We report accuracy, speed, and memory metrics with mean and standard deviation across multiple seeds. A two-by-two OOB robustness matrix evaluates behavior under different boundary modes and OOB policies. In a case study, we compile a trained KAN model for DoS attack detection (CICIDS2017 pipeline) into LUT artifacts. The compiled model preserves classification quality (F1 drop below 0.0002) while reducing steady-state CPU inference latency by 12x under NumPy and 10x under Numba backends (honest baseline). The memory overhead is approximately 10x at L=64. All code and artifacts are publicly available with fixed release tags for reproducibility.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出一种物理信息驱动的高斯过程回归（GPR）方法，替代传统KCC混凝土本构模型中经验性失效面，提升外推能力、物理一致性和不确定性量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KCC等经验本构模型依赖人工标定的失效面，缺乏灵活性和不确定性量化能力，难以可靠外推。

Method: 在保持KCC模型弹塑性模块结构基础上，用施加导数约束的物理信息GPR代理模型替代其经验失效面；利用不同围压下的三轴压缩实验数据训练，并评估其在未见围压下的泛化性能。

Result: 物理约束GPR显著优于无约束GPR：在外推区域仍保持高精度与物理合理性，预测方差更小，置信区间更紧；即使加入仿真数据，无约束GPR仍易违反物理约束。

Conclusion: 该方法兼顾KCC模型的可解释性与计算效率，提供鲁棒、不确定性感知的代理模型，为混凝土本构建模提供了实用改进路径。

Abstract: Understanding and modeling the constitutive behavior of concrete is crucial for civil and defense applications, yet widely used phenomenological models such as Karagozian \& Case concrete (KCC) model depend on empirically calibrated failure surfaces that lack flexibility in model form and associated uncertainty quantification. This work develops a physics-informed framework that retains the modular elastoplastic structure of KCC model while replacing its empirical failure surface with a constrained Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) surrogate that can be learned directly from experimentally accessible observables. Triaxial compression data under varying confinement levels are used for training, and the surrogate is then evaluated at confinement levels not included in the training set to assess its generalization capability. Results show that an unconstrained GPR interpolates well near training conditions but deteriorates and violates essential physical constraints under extrapolation, even when augmented with simulated data. In contrast, a physics-informed GPR that incorporates derivative-based constraints aligned with known material behavior yields markedly better accuracy and reliability, including at higher confinement levels beyond the training range. Probabilistic enforcement of these constraints also reduces predictive variance, producing tighter confidence intervals in data-scarce regimes. Overall, the proposed approach delivers a robust, uncertainty-aware surrogate that improves generalization and streamlines calibration without sacrificing the interpretability and numerical efficiency of the KCC model, offering a practical path toward an improved constitutive models for concrete.

Result: 在仅1000个训练样本下，PQK-enhanced CNN在MNIST和CIFAR-10上分别达到95%和90%准确率，远超经典CNN的60%和12%。

Conclusion: 投影量子核可有效缓解小数据场景下的模型性能瓶颈，为量子辅助神经网络提供了新思路。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown promising results in efficiency and accuracy in image classification. However, their efficacy often relies on large, labeled datasets, posing challenges for applications with limited data availability. Our research addresses these challenges by introducing an innovative approach that leverages projected quantum kernels (PQK) to enhance feature extraction for CNNs, specifically tailored for small datasets. Projected quantum kernels, derived from quantum computing principles, offer a promising avenue for capturing complex patterns and intricate data structures that traditional CNNs might miss. By incorporating these kernels into the feature extraction process, we improved the representational ability of CNNs. Our experiments demonstrated that, with 1000 training samples, the PQK-enhanced CNN achieved 95% accuracy on the MNIST dataset and 90% on the CIFAR-10 dataset, significantly outperforming the classical CNN, which achieved only 60% and 12% accuracy on the respective datasets. This research reveals the potential of quantum computing in overcoming data scarcity issues in machine learning and paves the way for future exploration of quantum-assisted neural networks, suggesting that projected quantum kernels can serve as a powerful approach for enhancing CNN-based classification in data-constrained environments.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework to accelerate route prediction in Drone-as-a-Service operations through weather-aware deep learning models. While classical path-planning algorithms, such as A* and Dijkstra, provide optimal solutions, their computational complexity limits real-time applicability in dynamic environments. We address this limitation by training machine learning and deep learning models on synthetic datasets generated from classical algorithm simulations. Our approach incorporates transformer-based and attention-based architectures that utilize weather heuristics to predict optimal next-node selections while accounting for meteorological conditions affecting drone operations. The attention mechanisms dynamically weight environmental factors including wind patterns, wind bearing, and temperature to enhance routing decisions under adverse weather conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our weather-aware models achieve significant computational speedup over traditional algorithms while maintaining route optimization performance, with transformer-based architectures showing superior adaptation to dynamic environmental constraints. The proposed framework enables real-time, weather-responsive route optimization for large-scale DaaS operations, representing a substantial advancement in the efficiency and safety of autonomous drone systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了SIGMA框架，通过分析嵌入Gram矩阵的谱特性来量化和预测大语言模型在合成数据递归训练中出现的‘模型崩溃’现象，提供了一种可扩展且理论严谨的监测方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着合成数据在大语言模型训练中的广泛应用，‘模型崩溃’（即递归使用模型生成数据导致表征质量下降）问题日益突出，但目前尚缺乏在高维空间中定量预测其发生的严格方法。

Method: 提出SIGMA（Spectral Inequalities for Gram Matrix Analysis）框架，利用嵌入Gram矩阵的确定性与随机性谱界，从谱分析角度建模表征空间收缩；采用随机估计避免大规模模型的全特征分解。

Result: SIGMA能有效捕捉模型向退化状态演化的过渡过程，在理论层面揭示崩溃机制，并在实践中实现对大规模递归训练流程的可扩展健康监测。

Conclusion: SIGMA为模型崩溃提供了统一、可解释、可扩展的量化基准， bridging the gap between theoretical understanding and practical deployment in synthetic-data-driven LLM training.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of synthetic data for training Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced the technical challenge of "model collapse"-a degenerative process where recursive training on model-generated content leads to a contraction of distributional variance and representational quality. While the phenomenology of collapse is increasingly evident, rigorous methods to quantify and predict its onset in high-dimensional spaces remain elusive. In this paper, we introduce SIGMA (Spectral Inequalities for Gram Matrix Analysis), a unified framework that benchmarks model collapse through the spectral lens of the embedding Gram matrix. By deriving and utilizing deterministic and stochastic bounds on the matrix's spectrum, SIGMA provides a mathematically grounded metric to track the contraction of the representation space. Crucially, our stochastic formulation enables scalable estimation of these bounds, making the framework applicable to large-scale foundation models where full eigendecomposition is intractable. We demonstrate that SIGMA effectively captures the transition towards degenerate states, offering both theoretical insights into the mechanics of collapse and a practical, scalable tool for monitoring the health of recursive training pipelines.

TL;DR: 本文提出PanSubNet，一种可解释的深度学习框架，能直接从常规H&E染色全切片图像（WSI）预测胰腺导管腺癌（PDAC）的分子亚型（基底样型和经典型），无需昂贵且耗时的RNA测序，具有临床部署潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PDAC分子分型（如基底样型/经典型）虽具预后和预测价值，但受限于RNA-seq的成本、耗时和组织需求，难以在临床中广泛应用。

Method: PanSubNet采用双尺度架构，融合细胞级形态与组织级结构信息，结合注意力机制实现多尺度表征学习和可解释性特征归因；基于1055例患者（PANCAN+TCGA）配对H&E图像与RNA-seq数据训练，金标准为Moffitt 50基因签名联合GATA6表达优化。

Result: 内部验证（PANCAN五折交叉验证）平均AUC达88.5%，外部验证（TCGA独立队列）AUC为84.0%；预测结果与转录组程序、分化标志物及DNA损伤修复信号一致；在转移性疾病中仍保持甚至增强预后分层能力；预测不确定性反映中间转录态而非噪声。

Conclusion: PanSubNet是一种快速、低成本、可解释且临床可行的PDAC分子分型工具，有望整合进数字病理工作流，推动PDAC精准诊疗。

Abstract: Molecular subtyping of PDAC into basal-like and classical has established prognostic and predictive value. However, its use in clinical practice is limited by cost, turnaround time, and tissue requirements, thereby restricting its application in the management of PDAC. We introduce PanSubNet, an interpretable deep learning framework that predicts therapy-relevant molecular subtypes directly from standard H&E-stained WSIs. PanSubNet was developed using data from 1,055 patients across two multi-institutional cohorts (PANCAN, n=846; TCGA, n=209) with paired histology and RNA-seq data. Ground-truth labels were derived using the validated Moffitt 50-gene signature refined by GATA6 expression. The model employs dual-scale architecture that fuses cellular-level morphology with tissue-level architecture, leveraging attention mechanisms for multi-scale representation learning and transparent feature attribution. On internal validation within PANCAN using five-fold cross-validation, PanSubNet achieved mean AUC of 88.5% with balanced sensitivity and specificity. External validation on the independent TCGA cohort without fine-tuning demonstrated robust generalizability (AUC 84.0%). PanSubNet preserved and, in metastatic disease, strengthened prognostic stratification compared to RNA-seq based labels. Prediction uncertainty linked to intermediate transcriptional states, not classification noise. Model predictions are aligned with established transcriptomic programs, differentiation markers, and DNA damage repair signatures. By enabling rapid, cost-effective molecular stratification from routine H&E-stained slides, PanSubNet offers a clinically deployable and interpretable tool for genetic subtyping. We are gathering data from two institutions to validate and assess real-world performance, supporting integration into digital pathology workflows and advancing precision oncology for PDAC.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出RAILS框架，通过无梯度、无先验的token级迭代优化，实现对大语言模型的高效对抗性越狱攻击，显著提升黑盒攻击迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全评估方法因依赖手工先验或白盒梯度而高估模型鲁棒性，亟需更通用、更现实的攻击范式。

Method: 提出RAILS（随机迭代局部搜索）框架，仅基于模型logits进行优化；引入自回归损失确保前缀精确匹配，并设计基于历史的选择策略以对齐代理目标与真实攻击成功率；支持跨分词器集成攻击。

Result: RAILS在多个开源模型上达到近100%攻击成功率，并在GPT、Gemini等闭源模型上展现出高黑盒迁移能力。

Conclusion: 无需梯度或先验知识的token级迭代搜索是可行且高效的，RAILS揭示了跨分词器共享的对抗模式，为评估LLM真实鲁棒性提供了新基准。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in safety-critical domains, rigorously evaluating their robustness against adversarial jailbreaks is essential. However, current safety evaluations often overestimate robustness because existing automated attacks are limited by restrictive assumptions. They typically rely on handcrafted priors or require white-box access for gradient propagation. We challenge these constraints by demonstrating that token-level iterative optimization can succeed without gradients or priors. We introduce RAILS (RAndom Iterative Local Search), a framework that operates solely on model logits. RAILS matches the effectiveness of gradient-based methods through two key innovations: a novel auto-regressive loss that enforces exact prefix matching, and a history-based selection strategy that bridges the gap between the proxy optimization objective and the true attack success rate. Crucially, by eliminating gradient dependency, RAILS enables cross-tokenizer ensemble attacks. This allows for the discovery of shared adversarial patterns that generalize across disjoint vocabularies, significantly enhancing transferability to closed-source systems. Empirically, RAILS achieves near 100% success rates on multiple open-source models and high black-box attack transferability to closed-source systems like GPT and Gemini.

*Valentin Noël*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需训练的机制探针，利用注意力图谱（attention-graph spectra）分析大语言模型的内部工作机制，发现其谱特征（如代数连通性λ₂、平滑度、谱熵）可形成稳定的‘谱指纹’，揭示标准评测忽略的模型行为断层，特别是课程学习切换引发的‘被动触发连通性崩溃’（PTCC）现象，并定位到特定稀疏注意力头补丁，验证了拓扑特性与分词密度而非语种强相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 行为基准只能告诉我们模型‘做什么’，而无法揭示‘如何做’；需要一种能深入模型内部机制、不依赖训练的可解释性分析工具。

Method: 提出基于注意力图谱的训练自由机制探针：将每层注意力视为一个token图，计算其代数连通性（λ₂）、平滑度和谱熵；在12个模型、10种语言上提取‘谱指纹’，并结合课程过渡分析、谱特征追踪、激活干预等方法进行机制归因。

Result: 发现了Passive-Triggered Connectivity Collapse（PTCC）现象——特定课程切换（如code-to-chat）导致英语非典型句法结构下λ₂骤降≈−0.76；PTCC反映形式化路由增强与风格灵活性下降的权衡；识别出4种重复加工策略并实现完美谱系溯源；定位到Layer 2稀疏‘补偿性补丁’，通过激活引导可恢复约38%信息流；主流拓扑模式主要由分词密度而非语言身份决定。

Conclusion: 注意力图谱谱特征是一种实用、稳定、可推广的模型机制审计工具，可用于训练范式验证与内在能力诊断，揭示了模型几何结构与数据分布间的深层耦合关系。

Abstract: Behavioral benchmarks tell us \textit{what} a model does, but not \textit{how}. We introduce a training-free mechanistic probe using attention-graph spectra. Treating each layer as a token graph, we compute algebraic connectivity ($λ_2$), smoothness, and spectral entropy. Across 12 models and 10 languages, these measures yield stable ``spectral fingerprints'' that expose discontinuities missed by standard evaluation.
  We report four results. (1) Models undergoing specific curriculum transitions (e.g., code-to-chat) show an English-only, syntax-triggered connectivity failure on non-canonical constructions, reaching $Δλ_2 \approx -0.76$. We term this scar \textit{Passive-Triggered Connectivity Collapse} (PTCC). Analysis of the Phi lineage reveals that PTCC appears and resolves across developmental stages, implicating brittle curriculum shifts rather than synthetic data per se. (2) PTCC reflects a specialization trade-off: strengthened formal routing at the expense of stylistic flexibility. (3) We identify four recurrent processing strategies; simple frozen-threshold rules enable perfect forensic identification across lineages. (4) Mechanistically, PTCC localizes to a sparse Layer 2 ``compensatory patch'' of heads that fails under syntactic stress; activation steering can partially restore connectivity, recovering $\approx 38\%$ of lost information flow.
  Finally, dominant topological regimes track tokenization density more than language identity, suggesting ``healthy'' geometry varies systematically across scripts. Overall, attention-graph spectra provide a practical tool for auditing and training-regime verification.

TL;DR: 本文提出COMMITTEEAUDIT框架，发现MoE模型中存在跨领域、跨层的'常设委员会'（Standing Committee），即一组被频繁路由的专家，它们承担了大部分计算任务，而其他专家则处理特定领域的知识。这表明MoE模型的实际专业化程度远低于预期，并揭示了当前训练目标（如负载均衡损失）可能与模型自然优化路径相冲突。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质疑MoE模型通过稀疏路由实现领域专业化的普遍假设，探究其实际路由行为是否真呈现领域特异性。

Method: 提出COMMITTEEAUDIT——一种后验分析框架，聚焦于专家群体而非单个专家的路由行为；在三个代表性MoE模型和MMLU基准上进行实证分析，并辅以定性分析。

Result: 发现存在一个跨领域、跨层、跨路由预算的紧凑型‘常设委员会’，它持续承载大部分路由质量；该委员会主要锚定推理结构与语法，外围专家才负责领域知识；当前负载均衡等训练目标可能违背模型内在优化倾向。

Conclusion: MoE模型中专业化并非广泛存在，而是呈现出强烈的中心化计算结构偏差；现有训练目标可能限制了训练效率与性能提升。

Abstract: Mixture of Experts models are widely assumed to achieve domain specialization through sparse routing. In this work, we question this assumption by introducing COMMITTEEAUDIT, a post hoc framework that analyzes routing behavior at the level of expert groups rather than individual experts. Across three representative models and the MMLU benchmark, we uncover a domain-invariant Standing Committee. This is a compact coalition of routed experts that consistently captures the majority of routing mass across domains, layers, and routing budgets, even when architectures already include shared experts. Qualitative analysis further shows that Standing Committees anchor reasoning structure and syntax, while peripheral experts handle domain-specific knowledge. These findings reveal a strong structural bias toward centralized computation, suggesting that specialization in Mixture of Experts models is far less pervasive than commonly believed. This inherent bias also indicates that current training objectives, such as load-balancing losses that enforce uniform expert utilization, may be working against the model's natural optimization path, thereby limiting training efficiency and performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有新闻视频理解基准局限于单源、视频内推理，而真实新闻消费涉及多源报道，需模型具备跨源比较、证据对齐与信息融合能力。

Method: 构建了VNU-Bench基准，包含429个新闻组、1405个视频和2501个高质量问题；设计新型混合式人机问答生成流程以兼顾数据规模与质量；定义多种专用于多源理解的新题型。

Result: 在闭源与开源多模态模型上的全面评测表明，VNU-Bench对当前MLLMs构成显著挑战。

Conclusion: VNU-Bench填补了多源跨视频新闻理解基准的空白，为推动MLLMs在复杂、真实新闻场景中的鲁棒理解能力提供了重要评测平台。

Abstract: News videos are carefully edited multimodal narratives that combine narration, visuals, and external quotations into coherent storylines. In recent years, there have been significant advances in evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for news video understanding. However, existing benchmarks largely focus on single-source, intra-video reasoning, where each report is processed in isolation. In contrast, real-world news consumption is inherently multi-sourced: the same event is reported by different outlets with complementary details, distinct narrative choices, and sometimes conflicting claims that unfold over time. Robust news understanding, therefore, requires models to compare perspectives from different sources, align multimodal evidence across sources, and synthesize multi-source information. To fill this gap, we introduce VNU-Bench, the first benchmark for multi-source, cross-video understanding in the news domain. We design a set of new question types that are unique in testing models' ability of understanding multi-source multimodal news from a variety of different angles. We design a novel hybrid human-model QA generation process that addresses the issues of scalability and quality control in building a large dataset for cross-source news understanding. The dataset comprises 429 news groups, 1,405 videos, and 2,501 high-quality questions. Comprehensive evaluation of both closed- and open-source multimodal models shows that VNU-Bench poses substantial challenges for current MLLMs.

Abstract: User-Defined Text Classification (UDTC) considers the challenge of classifying input text to user-specified, previously unseen classes, a setting that arises frequently in real-world applications such as enterprise analytics, content moderation, and domain-specific information retrieval. We propose a soft-contextualized encoder architecture for UDTC which contextualizes each candidate label with the label set and a static soft prompt representation of the input query. Training on diverse, multi-source datasets enables the model to generalize effectively to zero-shot classification over entirely unseen topic sets drawn from arbitrary domains. We evaluate the proposed architecture both on held-out in-distribution test data and on multiple unseen UDTC benchmarks. Across datasets, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming or matching the baselines.

Abstract: We study the problem of imputing a designated target variable that is systematically missing in a shifted deployment domain, when a Gaussian causal DAG is available from a fully observed source domain. We propose a unified EM-based framework that combines source and target data through the DAG structure to transfer information from observed variables to the missing target. On the methodological side, we formulate a population EM operator in the DAG parameter space and introduce a first-order (gradient) EM update that replaces the costly generalized least-squares M-step with a single projected gradient step. Under standard local strong-concavity and smoothness assumptions and a BWY-style \cite{Balakrishnan2017EM} gradient-stability (bounded missing-information) condition, we show that this first-order EM operator is locally contractive around the true target parameters, yielding geometric convergence and finite-sample guarantees on parameter error and the induced target-imputation error in Gaussian SEMs under covariate shift and local mechanism shifts. Algorithmically, we exploit the known causal DAG to freeze source-invariant mechanisms and re-estimate only those conditional distributions directly affected by the shift, making the procedure scalable to higher-dimensional models. In experiments on a synthetic seven-node SEM, the 64-node MAGIC-IRRI genetic network, and the Sachs protein-signaling data, the proposed DAG-aware first-order EM algorithm improves target imputation accuracy over a fit-on-source Bayesian network and a Kiiveri-style EM baseline, with the largest gains under pronounced domain shift.

Abstract: Progressive driver behavior analytics is crucial for improving road safety and mitigating the issues caused by aggressive or inattentive driving. Previous studies have employed machine learning and deep learning techniques, which often result in low feature optimization, thereby compromising both high performance and interpretability. To fill these voids, this paper proposes a hybrid approach to driver behavior analysis that uses a 12,857-row and 18-column data set taken from Kaggle. After applying preprocessing techniques such as label encoding, random oversampling, and standard scaling, 13 machine learning algorithms were tested. The Random Forest Classifier achieved an accuracy of 95%. After deploying the LIME technique in XAI, the top 10 features with the most significant positive and negative influence on accuracy were identified, and the same algorithms were retrained. The accuracy of the Random Forest Classifier decreased slightly to 94.2%, confirming that the efficiency of the model can be improved without sacrificing performance. This hybrid model can provide a return on investment in terms of the predictive power and explainability of the driver behavior process.

Abstract: Deploying models, especially large language models (LLMs), is becoming increasingly attractive to a broader user base, including those without specialized expertise. However, due to the resource constraints of certain hardware, maintaining high accuracy with larger model while meeting the hardware requirements remains a significant challenge. Model quantization technique helps mitigate memory and compute bottlenecks, yet the added complexities of tuning and deploying quantized models further exacerbates these challenges, making the process unfriendly to most of the users. We introduce the Hardware-Aware Quantization Agent (HAQA), an automated framework that leverages LLMs to streamline the entire quantization and deployment process by enabling efficient hyperparameter tuning and hardware configuration, thereby simultaneously improving deployment quality and ease of use for a broad range of users. Our results demonstrate up to a 2.3x speedup in inference, along with increased throughput and improved accuracy compared to unoptimized models on Llama. Additionally, HAQA is designed to implement adaptive quantization strategies across diverse hardware platforms, as it automatically finds optimal settings even when they appear counterintuitive, thereby reducing extensive manual effort and demonstrating superior adaptability. Code will be released.

Motivation: 主流的pass/fail奖励稀疏，限制性能；外部奖励模型（RM）存在对齐差、计算开销大问题。

Method: VeRPO利用训练过程中各单元测试的执行统计动态估计其难度权重，将通过的测试权重求和形成稠密奖励，并融合全局执行结果以保证与最终功能正确性一致。

Conclusion: VeRPO实现了仅依赖可验证执行反馈的鲁棒、稠密奖励范式，在效果、效率与资源占用间取得最优平衡。

Abstract: Effective reward design is a central challenge in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for code generation. Mainstream pass/fail outcome rewards enforce functional correctness via executing unit tests, but the resulting sparsity limits potential performance gains. While recent work has explored external Reward Models (RM) to generate richer, continuous rewards, the learned RMs suffer from reward misalignment and prohibitive computational cost. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{VeRPO} (\textbf{V}erifiable D\textbf{e}nse \textbf{R}eward \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization), a novel RL framework for code generation that synthesizes \textit{robust and dense rewards fully grounded in verifiable execution feedback}. The core idea of VeRPO is constructing dense rewards from weighted partial success: by dynamically estimating the difficulty weight of each unit test based on the execution statistics during training, a dense reward is derived from the sum of weights of the passed unit tests. To solidify the consistency between partial success and end-to-end functional correctness, VeRPO further integrates the dense signal with global execution outcomes, establishing a robust and dense reward paradigm relying solely on verifiable execution feedback. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and settings demonstrate that VeRPO consistently outperforms outcome-driven and RM-based baselines, achieving up to +8.83\% gain in pass@1 with negligible time cost (< 0.02\%) and zero GPU memory overhead.

Abstract: Spherical deep learning has been widely applied to a broad range of real-world problems. Existing approaches often face challenges in balancing strong spherical geometric inductive biases with the need to model real-world heterogeneity. To solve this while retaining spherical geometry, we first introduce a designable Green's function framework (DGF) to provide new spherical operator solution strategy: Design systematic Green's functions under rotational group. Based on DGF, to model biological heterogeneity, we propose Green's-Function Spherical Neural Operator (GSNO) fusing 3 operator solutions: (1) Equivariant Solution derived from Equivariant Green's Function for symmetry-consistent modeling; (2) Invariant Solution derived from Invariant Green's Function to eliminate nuisance heterogeneity, e.g., consistent background field; (3) Anisotropic Solution derived from Anisotropic Green's Function to model anisotropic systems, especially fibers with preferred direction. Therefore, the resulting model, GSNO can adapt to real-world heterogeneous systems with nuisance variability and anisotropy while retaining spectral efficiency. Evaluations on spherical MNIST, Shallow Water Equation, diffusion MRI fiber prediction, cortical parcellation and molecule structure modeling demonstrate the superiority of GSNO.

Abstract: Chronic diseases such as diabetes pose significant management challenges, particularly due to the risk of complications like hypoglycemia, which require timely detection and intervention. Continuous health monitoring through wearable sensors offers a promising solution for early prediction of glycemic events. However, effective use of multisensor data is hindered by issues such as signal noise and frequent missing values. This study examines the limitations of existing datasets and emphasizes the temporal characteristics of key features relevant to hypoglycemia prediction. A comprehensive analysis of imputation techniques is conducted, focusing on those employed in state-of-the-art studies. Furthermore, imputation methods derived from machine learning and deep learning applications in other healthcare contexts are evaluated for their potential to address longer gaps in time-series data. Based on this analysis, a systematic paradigm is proposed, wherein imputation strategies are tailored to the nature of specific features and the duration of missing intervals. The review concludes by emphasizing the importance of investigating the temporal dynamics of individual features and the implementation of multiple, feature-specific imputation techniques to effectively address heterogeneous temporal patterns inherent in the data.

Conclusion: stLID通过联合建模时空异常，有效提升了高维地质监测数据中复杂滑坡事件的早期识别能力，具有实际地质灾害防控应用价值。

Abstract: Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID) has shown strong potential for identifying anomalies and outliers in high-dimensional data across a wide range of real-world applications, including landslide failure detection in granular media. Early and accurate identification of failure zones in landslide-prone areas is crucial for effective geohazard mitigation. While existing approaches typically rely on surface displacement data analyzed through statistical or machine learning techniques, they often fall short in capturing both the spatial correlations and temporal dynamics that are inherent in such data. To address this gap, we focus on ground-monitored landslides and introduce a novel approach that jointly incorporates spatial and temporal information, enabling the detection of complex landslides and including multiple successive failures occurring in distinct areas of the same slope. To be specific, our method builds upon an existing LID-based technique, known as sLID. We extend its capabilities in three key ways. (1) Kinematic enhancement: we incorporate velocity into the sLID computation to better capture short-term temporal dependencies and deformation rate relationships. (2) Spatial fusion: we apply Bayesian estimation to aggregate sLID values across spatial neighborhoods, effectively embedding spatial correlations into the LID scores. (3) Temporal modeling: we introduce a temporal variant, tLID, that learns long-term dynamics from time series data, providing a robust temporal representation of displacement behavior. Finally, we integrate both components into a unified framework, referred to as spatiotemporal LID (stLID), to identify samples that are anomalous in either or both dimensions. Extensive experiments show that stLID consistently outperforms existing methods in failure detection precision and lead-time.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE模型的核心机制（Top-k路由和负载均衡）缺乏统一、严谨的理论支撑，仅为启发式设计，亟需从基础原理层面解释其有效性。

Method: 从贝叶斯推断出发，将路由建模为稀疏后验近似与先验正则化；结合信息论，将其诠释为最小化路由歧义性与最大化信道容量；形式化定义路由为NP难的稀疏子集选择问题，并理论分析专家表征相干性对贪心算法性能的影响；证明几何正交性作为正则化可保证多项式时间算法逼近全局最优。

Result: 首次建立MoE路由机制的统一理论解释；严格证明‘一致性壁垒’的存在及正交正则化的充分性；通过对比实验验证正交正则化是最优工程松弛方案。

Conclusion: Top-k路由与负载均衡并非经验性技巧，而是贝叶斯最优与信息论最优的自然结果；专家表征的几何正交性是保障高效可扩展MoE设计的关键理论依据与实用准则。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts models enable large language models to scale efficiently, as they only activate a subset of experts for each input. Their core mechanisms, Top-k routing and auxiliary load balancing, remain heuristic, however, lacking a cohesive theoretical underpinning to support them. To this end, we build the first unified theoretical framework that rigorously derives these practices as optimal sparse posterior approximation and prior regularization from a Bayesian perspective, while simultaneously framing them as mechanisms to minimize routing ambiguity and maximize channel capacity from an information-theoretic perspective. We also pinpoint the inherent combinatorial hardness of routing, defining it as the NP-hard sparse subset selection problem. We rigorously prove the existence of a "Coherence Barrier"; when expert representations exhibit high mutual coherence, greedy routing strategies theoretically fail to recover the optimal expert subset. Importantly, we formally verify that imposing geometric orthogonality in the expert feature space is sufficient to narrow the divide between the NP-hard global optimum and polynomial-time greedy approximation. Our comparative analyses confirm orthogonality regularization as the optimal engineering relaxation for large-scale models. Our work offers essential theoretical support and technical assurance for a deeper understanding and novel designs of MoE.

Motivation: 联邦学习在现实场景中因客户端数据统计异质性而面临稳定性挑战，其根源在于异质性扭曲了本地梯度动态，引发系统性漂移并阻碍全局收敛。

Method: 提出一种通用的客户端视角，不增加通信开销地调控本地梯度贡献；受群体智能启发，设计Exploratory--Convergent Gradient Re-aggregation（ECGR）方法，平衡对齐与未对齐梯度分量以保留有效更新、抑制不稳定效应。

Result: 理论分析与大量实验（包括LC25000医学影像数据集）表明，ECGR能一致提升多种SOTA联邦学习方法在异构数据下的稳定性与收敛性。

Conclusion: 本地梯度是稳定异构联邦学习系统的关键调控杠杆，ECGR为解决统计异质性带来的不稳定性提供了有效且低开销的客户端侧解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients without sharing raw data, yet its stability is fundamentally challenged by statistical heterogeneity in realistic deployments. Here, we show that client heterogeneity destabilizes FL primarily by distorting local gradient dynamics during client-side optimization, causing systematic drift that accumulates across communication rounds and impedes global convergence. This observation highlights local gradients as a key regulatory lever for stabilizing heterogeneous FL systems. Building on this insight, we develop a general client-side perspective that regulates local gradient contributions without incurring additional communication overhead. Inspired by swarm intelligence, we instantiate this perspective through Exploratory--Convergent Gradient Re-aggregation (ECGR), which balances well-aligned and misaligned gradient components to preserve informative updates while suppressing destabilizing effects. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, including evaluations on the LC25000 medical imaging dataset, demonstrate that regulating local gradient dynamics consistently stabilizes federated learning across state-of-the-art methods under heterogeneous data distributions.

Abstract: Smartphone sensing offers an unobtrusive and scalable way to track daily behaviors linked to mental health, capturing changes in sleep, mobility, and phone use that often precede symptoms of stress, anxiety, or depression. While most prior studies focus on detection that responds to existing conditions, forecasting mental health enables proactive support through Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive benchmarking study comparing traditional machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and large language model (LLM) approaches for mental health forecasting using the College Experience Sensing (CES) dataset, the most extensive longitudinal dataset of college student mental health to date. We systematically evaluate models across temporal windows, feature granularities, personalization strategies, and class imbalance handling. Our results show that DL models, particularly Transformer (Macro-F1 = 0.58), achieve the best overall performance, while LLMs show strength in contextual reasoning but weaker temporal modeling. Personalization substantially improves forecasts of severe mental health states. By revealing how different modeling approaches interpret phone sensing behavioral data over time, this work lays the groundwork for next-generation, adaptive, and human-centered mental health technologies that can advance both research and real-world well-being.

Abstract: Recent studies explored integrating state-space search algorithms with Language Models (LM) to perform look-ahead on the token generation process, the ''Tree-of-Thoughts'' (ToT), generated by LMs, thereby improving performance on problem-solving tasks. However, the affiliated search algorithms often overlook the significant computational costs associated with LM inference, particularly in scenarios with constrained computational budgets. Consequently, we address the problem of improving LM performance on problem-solving tasks under limited computational budgets. We demonstrate how the probabilities assigned to thoughts by LMs can serve as a heuristic to guide search within the ToT framework, thereby reducing the number of thought evaluations. Building on this insight, we adapt a heuristic search algorithm, Levin Tree Search (LTS), to the ToT framework, which leverages LMs as policies to guide the tree exploration efficiently. We extend the theoretical results of LTS by showing that, for ToT (a pruned tree), LTS guarantees a bound on the number of states expanded, and consequently, on the number of thoughts generated. Additionally, we analyze the sensitivity of this bound to the temperature values commonly used in the final softmax layer of the LM. Empirical evaluation under a fixed LM query budget demonstrates that LTS consistently achieves comparable or higher accuracy than baseline search algorithms within the ToT framework, across three domains (Blocksworld, PrOntoQA, Array Sorting) and four distinct LMs. These findings highlight the efficacy of LTS on ToT, particularly in enabling cost-effective and time-efficient problem-solving, making it well-suited for latency-critical and resource-constrained applications.

Empirical results show a 9.47% reduction in validation loss, confirmed by SVD analysis and an expert listening study (N=53). This dual theoretical and applied framework bridges gaps in AI music generation, offering verifiable insights for mathematically grounded deep learning.

Abstract: Digital twins and other simulators are increasingly used to support routing decisions in large-scale networks. However, simulator outputs often exhibit systematic bias, while ground-truth measurements are costly and scarce. We study a stochastic shortest-path problem in which a planner has access to abundant synthetic samples, limited real-world observations, and an edge-similarity structure capturing expected behavioral similarity across links. We model the simulator-to-reality discrepancy as an unknown, edge-specific bias that varies smoothly over the similarity graph, and estimate it using Laplacian-regularized least squares. This approach yields calibrated edge cost estimates even in data-scarce regimes. We establish finite-sample error bounds, translate estimation error into path-level suboptimality guarantees, and propose a computable, data-driven certificate that verifies near-optimality of a candidate route. For cold-start settings without initial real data, we develop a bias-aware active learning algorithm that leverages the simulator and adaptively selects edges to measure until a prescribed accuracy is met. Numerical experiments on multiple road networks and traffic graphs further demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.

Abstract: Artificial neural network operators (ANNOs) have been widely used for approximating deterministic input-output functions; however, their extension to random dynamics remains comparatively unexplored. In this paper, we construct a new class of \textbf{Kantorovich-type Stochastic Neural Network Operators (K-SNNOs)} in which randomness is incorporated not at the coefficient level, but through \textbf{stochastic neurons} driven by stochastic integrators. This framework enables the operator to inherit the probabilistic structure of the underlying process, making it suitable for modeling and approximating stochastic signals. We establish mean-square convergence of K-SNNOs to the target stochastic process and derive quantitative error estimates expressing the rate of approximation in terms of the modulus of continuity. Numerical simulations further validate the theoretical results by demonstrating accurate reconstruction of sample paths and rapid decay of the mean square error (MSE). Graphical results, including sample-wise approximations and empirical MSE behaviour, illustrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed stochastic-neuron-based operator.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于强化学习的调度器ReLA，通过结构化表征学习与聚合提升作业调度性能，在不同规模实例上显著降低最优性差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有作业调度方法在问题规模增大时存在运行时间长或调度质量不足的问题。

Method: ReLA采用多尺度架构，结合自注意力、卷积和交叉注意力模块，分别对作业操作和机器等调度实体进行内部与跨实体表征学习，并将输出聚合以支持强化学习决策。

Result: 在中小规模实例上，ReLA将SOTA基线的最优性差距降低13.0%；在大规模实例上降低78.6%，平均最优性差距分别降至7.3%和2.1%。

Conclusion: ReLA所学表征与聚合机制为强化学习调度提供了强决策支持，适用于实时制造系统中的快速作业完成与决策。

Abstract: Job scheduling is widely used in real-world manufacturing systems to assign ordered job operations to machines under various constraints. Existing solutions remain limited by long running time or insufficient schedule quality, especially when problem scale increases. In this paper, we propose ReLA, a reinforcement-learning (RL) scheduler built on structured representation learning and aggregation. ReLA first learns diverse representations from scheduling entities, including job operations and machines, using two intra-entity learning modules with self-attention and convolution and one inter-entity learning module with cross-attention. These modules are applied in a multi-scale architecture, and their outputs are aggregated to support RL decision-making. Across experiments on small, medium, and large job instances, ReLA achieves the best makespan in most tested settings over the latest solutions. On non-large instances, ReLA reduces the optimality gap of the SOTA baseline by 13.0%, while on large-scale instances it reduces the gap by 78.6%, with the average optimality gaps lowered to 7.3% and 2.1%, respectively. These results confirm that ReLA's learned representations and aggregation provide strong decision support for RL scheduling, and enable fast job completion and decision-making for real-world applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出两种信息论度量方法，用于量化神经元对单一概念的显著性和选择性，并在TabPFN这一表格基础模型中验证了部分神经元对高层概念具有中等但统计显著的显著性和选择性，表明可解释神经元可自然涌现且易于识别。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索基础模型中是否存在类似‘祖母细胞’的可解释神经元，即仅对单一概念有强响应的神经元，以提升模型透明性与可解释性。

Method: 提出两个基于信息论的指标——神经元显著性与选择性；在TabPFN模型表征上计算各神经元-概念对的指标值，并进行简单搜索以识别最优对。

Result: 首次发现TabPFN中部分神经元对高层概念表现出中等但统计显著的显著性与选择性。

Conclusion: 可解释神经元可在基础模型中自然出现，且可通过简单度量识别，无需复杂可解释性技术。

Abstract: Foundation models are powerful yet often opaque in their decision-making. A topic of continued interest in both neuroscience and artificial intelligence is whether some neurons behave like grandmother cells, i.e., neurons that are inherently interpretable because they exclusively respond to single concepts. In this work, we propose two information-theoretic measures that quantify the neuronal saliency and selectivity for single concepts. We apply these metrics to the representations of TabPFN, a tabular foundation model, and perform a simple search across neuron-concept pairs to find the most salient and selective pair. Our analysis provides the first evidence that some neurons in such models show moderate, statistically significant saliency and selectivity for high-level concepts. These findings suggest that interpretable neurons can emerge naturally and that they can, in some cases, be identified without resorting to more complex interpretability techniques.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为GESCL的正则化方法，用于固定容量CNN的持续学习，通过稳定性与可塑性正则项协同防止灾难性遗忘并提升网络适应新任务的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决固定容量CNN在持续学习中面临的灾难性遗忘问题，同时避免动态扩展网络或存储历史数据带来的高参数量与计算开销。

Method: 提出Group and Exclusive Sparsity based Continual Learning（GESCL）：引入稳定性正则项保护过往任务的重要滤波器，引入可塑性正则项利用CNN过参数化特性稀疏化网络并重用不重要滤波器以适配新任务。

Result: 在主流视觉持续学习基准上，GESCL在分类准确率和抗灾难性遗忘能力方面均显著优于现有最先进方法，且参数量和计算量更少。

Conclusion: GESCL是一种高效、轻量且有效的持续学习正则化框架，兼顾稳定性与可塑性，在固定容量CNN上实现了高性能持续学习。

Abstract: We present a regularization-based approach for continual learning (CL) of fixed capacity convolutional neural networks (CNN) that does not suffer from the problem of catastrophic forgetting when learning multiple tasks sequentially. This method referred to as Group and Exclusive Sparsity based Continual Learning (GESCL) avoids forgetting of previous tasks by ensuring the stability of the CNN via a stability regularization term, which prevents filters detected as important for past tasks to deviate too much when learning a new task. On top of that, GESCL makes the network plastic via a plasticity regularization term that leverage the over-parameterization of CNNs to efficiently sparsify the network and tunes unimportant filters making them relevant for future tasks. Doing so, GESCL deals with significantly less parameters and computation compared to CL approaches that either dynamically expand the network or memorize past tasks' data. Experiments on popular CL vision benchmarks show that GESCL leads to significant improvements over state-of-the-art method in terms of overall CL performance, as measured by classification accuracy as well as in terms of avoiding catastrophic forgetting.

*Amir Hossein Yari,Fajri Koto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出AMIR-GRPO，通过在GRPO中引入基于组内奖励排序的隐式DPO式对比正则项，无需额外标注，缓解长度偏差、增强低质量轨迹抑制、提升监督密度，在数学推理任务上显著优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在推理密集型任务中存在结构性缺陷：序列级优势归一化导致长度偏差、低质量轨迹惩罚被稀释、标量目标丢失组内奖励排序蕴含的丰富成对偏好信息，造成昂贵采样数据利用不足。

Method: 提出AMIR-GRPO，在GRPO基础上，从组内奖励排名中直接构建隐式的DPO风格对比正则项，不依赖额外标注；该机制强化对低奖励轨迹的抑制、削弱响应级长度偏差，并将每个rollout组转化为更密集的监督约束集。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准上，AMIR-GRPO持续超越强GRPO基线，使正确与错误推理链的区分更清晰，并在标准GRPO解决子集之外带来更广的覆盖提升。

Conclusion: AMIR-GRPO有效克服了GRPO在复杂推理对齐中的关键局限，提升了监督效率与模型推理能力，为LLM后训练提供了更鲁棒、信息更丰富的优化范式。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has become the primary paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks, with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) widely used in large-scale post-training. However, GRPO faces structural limitations in reasoning-heavy settings: sequence-level advantage normalization introduces systematic length bias, penalties for low-quality trajectories are diluted, and the scalar objective discards rich pairwise preference information embedded in within-group reward rankings. As a result, valuable supervision from costly rollouts remains underutilized.
  We propose AMIR-GRPO, which augments GRPO with an implicit DPO-style contrastive regularizer constructed directly from intra-group reward rankings, requiring no additional annotations. This mechanism amplifies suppression of low-reward trajectories, attenuates response-level length bias, and transforms each rollout group into a denser set of supervision constraints. Across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, AMIR-GRPO consistently outperforms strong GRPO baselines, yields clearer separation between correct and incorrect reasoning chains, and delivers broader coverage gains beyond the subset of instances solved by standard GRPO.

TL;DR: SVEAD是一种基于随机Voronoi图集成的异常检测方法，通过局部区域分解和归一化单元内距离加权评分，实现线性时间与常数空间复杂度，并在45个数据集上超越12种前沿方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常检测方法难以处理局部密度变化大的数据：基于距离的方法易漏检局部异常，基于密度的方法则参数敏感且计算开销大（二次时间复杂度）。

Method: 提出SVEAD方法，构建随机Voronoi图集成，对每个点基于其所在Voronoi单元内的归一化距离进行打分，并引入局部尺度加权。

Result: 在45个数据集上的实验表明，SVEAD性能优于12种当前最优方法，且具有线性时间复杂度和常数空间复杂度。

Conclusion: 利用几何分解思想（Voronoi划分）可有效揭示局部异常，SVEAD为高密度变化数据提供了一种高效、鲁棒的异常检测新范式。

Abstract: Anomaly detection aims to identify data instances that deviate significantly from majority of data, which has been widely used in fraud detection, network security, and industrial quality control. Existing methods struggle with datasets exhibiting varying local densities: distance-based methods miss local anomalies, while density-based approaches require careful parameter selection and incur quadratic time complexity. We observe that local anomalies, though indistinguishable under global analysis, become conspicuous when the data space is decomposed into restricted regions and each region is examined independently. Leveraging this geometric insight, we propose SVEAD (Stochastic Voronoi Ensembles Anomaly Detector), which constructs ensemble random Voronoi diagrams and scores points by normalized cell-relative distances weighted by local scale. The proposed method achieves linear time complexity and constant space complexity. Experiments on 45 datasets demonstrate that SVEAD outperforms 12 state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: 贝叶斯物理信息学习可有效提升预测的不确定性感知能力，为变压器资产的风险感知运维与智能决策提供新范式。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) provide a framework for integrating physical laws with data. However, their application to Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) remains constrained by the limited uncertainty quantification (UQ) capabilities. Most existing PINN-based prognostics approaches are deterministic or account only for epistemic uncertainty, limiting their suitability for risk-aware decision-making. This work introduces a heteroscedastic Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Network (B-PINN) framework that jointly models epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, yielding full predictive posteriors for spatiotemporal insulation material ageing estimation. The approach integrates Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) with physics-based residual enforcement and prior distributions, enabling probabilistic inference within a physics-informed learning architecture. The framework is evaluated on transformer insulation ageing application, validated with a finite-element thermal model and field measurements from a solar power plant, and benchmarked against deterministic PINNs, dropout-based PINNs (d-PINNs), and alternative B-PINN variants. Results show that the proposed B-PINN provides improved predictive accuracy and better-calibrated uncertainty estimates than competing approaches. A systematic sensitivity study further analyzes the impact of boundary-condition, initial-condition, and residual sampling strategies on accuracy, calibration, and generalization. Overall, the findings highlight the potential of Bayesian physics-informed learning to support uncertainty-aware prognostics and informed decision-making in transformer asset management.

Conclusion: RRE-PPO4Pred为工程信息学提供了更先进、自适应且交互式的时间序列预测方法，有效克服了传统RNN忽略时序贡献差异的固有缺陷。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a crucial role in contemporary engineering information systems for supporting decision-making across various industries, where Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been widely adopted due to their capability in modeling sequential data. Conventional RNN-based predictors adopt an encoder-only strategy with sliding historical windows as inputs to forecast future values. However, this approach treats all time steps and hidden states equally without considering their distinct contributions to forecasting, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Reinforced Recurrent Encoder with Prediction-oriented Proximal Policy Optimization, RRE-PPO4Pred, which significantly improves time series modeling capacity and forecasting accuracy of the RNN models. The core innovations of this method are: (1) A novel Reinforced Recurrent Encoder (RRE) framework that enhances RNNs by formulating their internal adaptation as a Markov Decision Process, creating a unified decision environment capable of learning input feature selection, hidden skip connection, and output target selection; (2) An improved Prediction-oriented Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm, termed PPO4Pred, which is equipped with a Transformer-based agent for temporal reasoning and develops a dynamic transition sampling strategy to enhance sampling efficiency; (3) A co-evolutionary optimization paradigm to facilitate the learning of the RNN predictor and the policy agent, providing adaptive and interactive time series modeling. Comprehensive evaluations on five real-world datasets indicate that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines, and attains accuracy better than state-of-the-art Transformer models, thus providing an advanced time series predictor in engineering informatics.

Abstract: With the rise of data-driven reaction prediction models, effective reaction descriptors are crucial for bridging the gap between real-world chemistry and digital representations. However, general-purpose, reaction-wise descriptors remain scarce. This study introduces RXNEmb, a novel reaction-level descriptor derived from RXNGraphormer, a model pre-trained to distinguish real reactions from fictitious ones with erroneous bond changes, thereby learning intrinsic bond formation and cleavage patterns. We demonstrate its utility by data-driven re-clustering of the USPTO-50k dataset, yielding a classification that more directly reflects bond-change similarities than rule-based categories. Combined with dimensionality reduction, RXNEmb enables visualization of reaction space diversity. Furthermore, attention weight analysis reveals the model's focus on chemically critical sites, providing mechanistic insight. RXNEmb serves as a powerful, interpretable tool for reaction fingerprinting and analysis, paving the way for more data-centric approaches in reaction analysis and discovery.

Abstract: Graph generative diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for generating complex graph structures, effectively capturing intricate dependencies and relationships within graph data. However, the privacy risks associated with these models remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate information leakage in such models through three types of black-box inference attacks. First, we design a graph reconstruction attack, which can reconstruct graphs structurally similar to those training graphs from the generated graphs. Second, we propose a property inference attack to infer the properties of the training graphs, such as the average graph density and the distribution of densities, from the generated graphs. Third, we develop two membership inference attacks to determine whether a given graph is present in the training set. Extensive experiments on three different types of graph generative diffusion models and six real-world graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of these attacks, significantly outperforming the baseline approaches. Finally, we propose two defense mechanisms that mitigate these inference attacks and achieve a better trade-off between defense strength and target model utility than existing methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出TreeAdv，一种基于树结构的优势重分配方法，用于改进组基强化学习（如GRPO）在大语言模型推理对齐中的效率与效果。TreeAdv显式建模组 rollout 的树状结构，通过熵驱动采样构建共享低不确定性token、分支高不确定性决策的森林，并将叶节点的序列优势重新分配至内部token，从而缓解长度偏差、提升样本效率。实验表明其在10个数学推理基准上优于GRPO/GSPO，且显著减少生成token数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准GRPO将rollout视为独立扁平序列，仅分配单一序列级优势，导致样本效率低和偏向冗长、浅层推理链的长度偏差，无法提升逻辑深度。

Method: TreeAdv构建由多个决策树组成的森林：利用熵驱动采样，在高不确定性token处分叉、低不确定性token处共享；然后将完整rollout（所有叶节点）的优势按树结构聚合并重分配至内部token段；可无缝适配GRPO、GSPO等组基目标。

Result: 在10个数学推理基准上，TreeAdv持续超越GRPO和GSPO，在相同监督信号、数据和解码预算下，显著减少生成token数量。

Conclusion: 显式建模组 rollout 的树结构并进行细粒度优势重分配，能有效缓解长度偏差、提升样本效率与推理深度，为组基强化学习提供更优的token级信用分配机制。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with group-based objectives, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), is a common framework for aligning large language models on complex reasoning tasks. However, standard GRPO treats each rollout trajectory as an independent flat sequence and assigns a single sequence-level advantage to all tokens, which leads to sample inefficiency and a length bias toward verbose, redundant chains of thought without improving logical depth. We introduce TreeAdv (Tree-Structured Advantage Redistribution for Group-Based RL), which makes the tree structure of group rollouts explicit for both exploration and advantage assignment. Specifically, TreeAdv builds a group of trees (a forest) based on an entropy-driven sampling method where each tree branches at high-uncertainty decisions while sharing low-uncertainty tokens across rollouts. Then, TreeAdv aggregates token-level advantages for internal tree segments by redistributing the advantages of complete rollouts (all leaf nodes), and TreeAdv can easily apply to group-based objectives such as GRPO or GSPO. Across 10 math reasoning benchmarks, TreeAdv consistently outperforms GRPO and GSPO, while using substantially fewer generated tokens under identical supervision, data, and decoding budgets.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于知识蒸馏的回归框架，利用结构信息训练、仅需序列数据推理，显著提升了蛋白质-蛋白质结合亲和力预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结构数据稀缺限制了结构基模型的泛化能力，而纯序列模型精度较低，需在数据可用性与预测精度间取得平衡。

Method: 采用知识蒸馏策略：以结构基模型为教师网络，序列基模型为学生网络，联合监督结合亲和力标签与中间特征表示；使用LOCO交叉验证评估。

Result: 在非冗余基准数据集上，蒸馏学生模型达到Pearson相关系数0.481、RMSE 2.488 kcal/mol，显著优于纯序列基线（0.375, 2.712），接近结构基模型（0.512, 2.445）。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏可有效将结构知识迁移至序列模型，在结构数据有限时缩小两类模型性能差距，具备良好扩展潜力。

Abstract: The trade-off between predictive accuracy and data availability makes it difficult to predict protein--protein binding affinity accurately. The lack of experimentally resolved protein structures limits the performance of structure-based machine learning models, which generally outperform sequence-based methods. In order to overcome this constraint, we suggest a regression framework based on knowledge distillation that uses protein structural data during training and only needs sequence data during inference. The suggested method uses binding affinity labels and intermediate feature representations to jointly supervise the training of a sequence-based student network under the guidance of a structure-informed teacher network. Leave-One-Complex-Out (LOCO) cross-validation was used to assess the framework on a non-redundant protein--protein binding affinity benchmark dataset. A maximum Pearson correlation coefficient (P_r) of 0.375 and an RMSE of 2.712 kcal/mol were obtained by sequence-only baseline models, whereas a P_r of 0.512 and an RMSE of 2.445 kcal/mol were obtained by structure-based models. With a P_r of 0.481 and an RMSE of 2.488 kcal/mol, the distillation-based student model greatly enhanced sequence-only performance. Improved agreement and decreased bias were further confirmed by thorough error analyses. With the potential to close the performance gap between sequence-based and structure-based models as larger datasets become available, these findings show that knowledge distillation is an efficient method for transferring structural knowledge to sequence-based predictors. The source code for running inference with the proposed distillation-based binding affinity predictor can be accessed at https://github.com/wajidarshad/ProteinAffinityKD.

### [263] [The Geometry of the Pivot: A Note on Lazy Pivoted Cholesky and Farthest Point Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03706)
*Gil Shabat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文揭示了Pivoted Cholesky分解在再生核希尔伯特空间（RKHS）中的几何意义：主元选择等价于基于核度量的最远点采样（FPS），而Cholesky因子构造则隐式实现了Gram-Schmidt正交化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Pivoted Cholesky分解在数值线性代数中代数性质明确，但其在核方法中的几何直观常不清晰，本文旨在阐明其在RKHS中的几何解释。

Method: 通过理论推导，将Pivoted Cholesky分解的主元选择与Farthest Point Sampling（FPS）建立等价关系，并指出Cholesky因子构造对应于RKHS中的隐式Gram-Schmidt正交化；辅以简洁推导和最小化Python实现。

Result: 明确了Pivoted Cholesky分解在RKHS中的几何含义：主元选择即FPS，因子构造即隐式正交化；提供了理论到实践的桥梁。

Conclusion: Pivoted Cholesky分解不仅是代数上有效的低秩近似工具，更具有清晰的几何意义——它在RKHS中执行一种基于核距离的贪心正交基构建过程。

Abstract: Low-rank approximations of large kernel matrices are ubiquitous in machine learning, particularly for scaling Gaussian Processes to massive datasets. The Pivoted Cholesky decomposition is a standard tool for this task, offering a computationally efficient, greedy low-rank approximation. While its algebraic properties are well-documented in numerical linear algebra, its geometric intuition within the context of kernel methods often remains obscure. In this note, we elucidate the geometric interpretation of the algorithm within the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). We demonstrate that the pivotal selection step is mathematically equivalent to Farthest Point Sampling (FPS) using the kernel metric, and that the Cholesky factor construction is an implicit Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization. We provide a concise derivation and a minimalist Python implementation to bridge the gap between theory and practice.

TL;DR: R^3L is a novel reinforcement learning framework for LLMs that improves exploration and exploitation by using language-guided reflection to retry from failure points, assigning credit only to pivotal decision points, and amplifying positive signals to ensure stable training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods for LLMs suffer from poor exploration (low success rates, high rollout costs) and flawed exploitation (coarse credit assignment, training instability due to trajectory-level rewards and failure-dominated data).

Method: R^3L introduces three core components: (1) Reflect-then-Retry for active trajectory synthesis using language feedback to localize and fix errors; (2) Pivotal Credit Assignment, updating gradients only on the diverging suffix after error localization; (3) Positive Amplification to upweight successful trajectories and stabilize off-policy optimization.

Result: R^3L achieves 5%–52% relative improvements over baselines on agentic and reasoning tasks while maintaining training stability.

Conclusion: R^3L effectively addresses key RL challenges in LLM reasoning and agency by combining language-guided exploration, precise credit assignment, and robust signal amplification—enabling more efficient, stable, and effective policy optimization.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning drives recent advances in LLM reasoning and agentic capabilities, yet current approaches struggle with both exploration and exploitation. Exploration suffers from low success rates on difficult tasks and high costs of repeated rollouts from scratch. Exploitation suffers from coarse credit assignment and training instability: Trajectory-level rewards penalize valid prefixes for later errors, and failure-dominated groups overwhelm the few positive signals, leaving optimization without constructive direction. To this end, we propose R$^3$L, Reflect-then-Retry Reinforcement Learning with Language-Guided Exploration, Pivotal Credit, and Positive Amplification. To synthesize high-quality trajectories, R$^3$L shifts from stochastic sampling to active synthesis via reflect-then-retry, leveraging language feedback to diagnose errors, transform failed attempts into successful ones, and reduce rollout costs by restarting from identified failure points. With errors diagnosed and localized, Pivotal Credit Assignment updates only the diverging suffix where contrastive signals exist, excluding the shared prefix from gradient update. Since failures dominate on difficult tasks and reflect-then-retry produces off-policy data, risking training instability, Positive Amplification upweights successful trajectories to ensure positive signals guide the optimization process. Experiments on agentic and reasoning tasks demonstrate 5\% to 52\% relative improvements over baselines while maintaining training stability.

TL;DR: 本文提出弹性信任区域（ETR）方法，通过动态调整优化约束以匹配信号质量，克服GRPO算法中静态信任区域的局限性，在AIME和MATH基准上提升准确性并缓解策略熵坍塌。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO算法采用统一、静态的信任区域约束，假设奖励信号同质，但实际推理任务中优势幅度与方差高度异质，导致其无法充分利用高质量信号、抑制噪声不足，并引发快速熵坍塌。

Method: 提出弹性信任区域（ETR），包含双层弹性机制：微观层面根据优势大小动态缩放PPO剪裁边界；宏观层面利用组内方差隐式为处于最优学习区的任务分配更大更新预算。

Result: 在AIME和MATH基准上，ETR持续优于GRPO，准确率更高，且显著缓解策略熵退化，保障持续探索能力。

Conclusion: 动态适配信号质量的信任区域设计比静态约束更契合结果驱动的强化学习本质，ETR为RLVR范式提供了更鲁棒、高效的优化框架。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as an important paradigm for unlocking reasoning capabilities in large language models, exemplified by the success of OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1. Currently, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) stands as the dominant algorithm in this domain due to its stable training and critic-free efficiency. However, we argue that GRPO suffers from a structural limitation: it imposes a uniform, static trust region constraint across all samples. This design implicitly assumes signal homogeneity, a premise misaligned with the heterogeneous nature of outcome-driven learning, where advantage magnitudes and variances fluctuate significantly. Consequently, static constraints fail to fully exploit high-quality signals while insufficiently suppressing noise, often precipitating rapid entropy collapse. To address this, we propose \textbf{E}lastic \textbf{T}rust \textbf{R}egions (\textbf{ETR}), a dynamic mechanism that aligns optimization constraints with signal quality. ETR constructs a signal-aware landscape through dual-level elasticity: at the micro level, it scales clipping boundaries based on advantage magnitude to accelerate learning from high-confidence paths; at the macro level, it leverages group variance to implicitly allocate larger update budgets to tasks in the optimal learning zone. Extensive experiments on AIME and MATH benchmarks demonstrate that ETR consistently outperforms GRPO, achieving superior accuracy while effectively mitigating policy entropy degradation to ensure sustained exploration.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM微调中的课程学习多采用静态预设课程，缺乏对模型训练过程中动态需求的适应性。

Method: 提出EDCO框架，包含高效熵估计器（利用前缀词元近似全序列熵）、熵驱动的动态课程生成器和LLM训练器，优先选择高推理熵样本进行训练。

Conclusion: 动态基于推理熵的课程学习能更有效地适配模型演化状态，显著提升领域微调性能与效率。

Abstract: Domain-specific large language models (LLMs), typically developed by fine-tuning a pre-trained general-purpose LLM on specialized datasets, represent a significant advancement in applied AI. A common strategy in LLM fine-tuning is curriculum learning, which pre-orders training samples based on metrics like difficulty to improve learning efficiency compared to a random sampling strategy. However, most existing methods for LLM fine-tuning rely on a static curriculum, designed prior to training, which lacks adaptability to the model's evolving needs during fine-tuning. To address this, we propose EDCO, a novel framework based on two key concepts: inference entropy and dynamic curriculum orchestration. Inspired by recent findings that maintaining high answer entropy benefits long-term reasoning gains, EDCO prioritizes samples with high inference entropy in a continuously adapted curriculum. EDCO integrates three core components: an efficient entropy estimator that uses prefix tokens to approximate full-sequence entropy, an entropy-based curriculum generator that selects data points with the highest inference entropy, and an LLM trainer that optimizes the model on the selected curriculum. Comprehensive experiments in communication, medicine and law domains, EDCO outperforms traditional curriculum strategies for fine-tuning Qwen3-4B and Llama3.2-3B models under supervised and reinforcement learning settings. Furthermore, the proposed efficient entropy estimation reduces computational time by 83.5% while maintaining high accuracy.

TL;DR: 本文提出GEM-2，一种轻量级概率Transformer模型，直接建模用户决策所依赖的大气状态函数（如极值、累积量、阈值超越），在保持高效训练的同时，在预报精度与经济价值上超越传统数值模式和部分先进ML方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有天气预报模型未直接学习用户实际决策所依赖的大气状态函数（如极值、累积量、阈值超越），导致用户需后处理估计，引入次优性和结构性偏差。

Method: 提出GEM-2——一种联合学习全球大气动力学与用户直接行动变量的概率Transformer；采用CRPS损失函数训练，参数量约2.75亿，训练速度比SOTA快20–100倍。

Result: GEM-2在预报精度上直接超越业务数值天气预报（NWP）模型，媲美依赖昂贵多步扩散或定制化多阶段微调的ML模型；在决策理论评估下取得SOTA经济价值指标；在次季节至季节尺度上稳定收敛于气候态；对多种常见架构与训练设计选择表现出意外鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 直接面向决策相关函数建模是提升天气预报实用价值的有效范式；GEM-2证明了轻量、高效、端到端的概率建模可在科学性与实用性间取得更好平衡。

Abstract: Weather forecasts sit upstream of high-stakes decisions in domains such as grid operations, aviation, agriculture, and emergency response. Yet forecast users often face a difficult trade-off. Many decision-relevant targets are functionals of the atmospheric state variables, such as extrema, accumulations, and threshold exceedances, rather than state variables themselves. As a result, users must estimate these targets via post-processing, which can be suboptimal and can introduce structural bias. The core issue is that decisions depend on distributions over these functionals that the model is not trained to learn directly.
  In this work, we introduce GEM-2, a probabilistic transformer that jointly learns global atmospheric dynamics alongside a suite of variables that users directly act upon. Using this training recipe, we show that a lightweight (~275M params) and computationally efficient (~20-100x training speedup relative to state-of-the-art) transformer trained on the CRPS objective can directly outperform operational numerical weather prediction (NWP) models and be competitive with ML models that rely on expensive multi-step diffusion processes or require bespoke multi-stage fine-tuning strategies. We further demonstrate state-of-the-art economic value metrics under decision-theoretic evaluation, stable convergence to climatology at S2S and seasonal timescales, and a surprising insensitivity to many commonly assumed architectural and training design choices.

*Noam Levi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种可解的最后层微调模型（LID模型），其中目标具有内在且实例异质的难度，通过引入重尾分布的潜在精度来刻画每个输入的目标方差。研究发现pass@$k$失败率呈幂律衰减，其有效指数β_eff随训练样本量N增长并最终饱和于由难度分布尾部决定的本征极限β；这揭示了学习过程会压缩误差分布的‘困难尾部’，从而提升泛化性能并陡化pass@$k$曲线。模型给出了可检验的闭式预测，包括训练与推理阶段的计算资源分配规则，并在模拟及CIFAR-10H、数学教师-学生蒸馏两个真实数据代理任务中得到验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解神经缩放律在实例异质难度下的行为，尤其是如何将泛化误差改进与推理性能（如pass@$k$）联系起来。

Method: 构建Latent Instance Difficulty (LID) 模型，假设每个输入的目标方差由来自重尾分布的潜在‘精度’控制；理论推导泛化损失与pass@$k$失败率的缩放行为；推导训练与推理的计算分配规则；通过模拟和真实数据代理（CIFAR-10H、数学蒸馏）验证。

Result: 发现pass@$k$失败率服从幂律衰减k^{-β_eff}，且β_eff随训练样本量N上升并饱和于本征β；证明学习通过压缩误差分布的‘硬尾’来提升推理性能；给出可检验的闭式预测与计算分配策略。

Conclusion: 泛化误差的改进与推理性能提升通过难度分布的尾部结构耦合；LID模型为理解大模型训练-推理权衡提供了可解析框架，并支持更高效的计算资源配置。

Abstract: We analyze neural scaling laws in a solvable model of last-layer fine-tuning where targets have intrinsic, instance-heterogeneous difficulty. In our Latent Instance Difficulty (LID) model, each input's target variance is governed by a latent ``precision'' drawn from a heavy-tailed distribution. While generalization loss recovers standard scaling laws, our main contribution connects this to inference. The pass@$k$ failure rate exhibits a power-law decay, $k^{-β_\text{eff}}$, but the observed exponent $β_\text{eff}$ is training-dependent. It grows with sample size $N$ before saturating at an intrinsic limit $β$ set by the difficulty distribution's tail. This coupling reveals that learning shrinks the ``hard tail'' of the error distribution: improvements in the model's generalization error steepen the pass@$k$ curve until irreducible target variance dominates. The LID model yields testable, closed-form predictions for this behavior, including a compute-allocation rule that favors training before saturation and inference attempts after. We validate these predictions in simulations and in two real-data proxies: CIFAR-10H (human-label variance) and a maths teacher-student distillation task.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种后处理剪枝策略，用于改进CFIRE算法生成的局部规则解释模型，以减少规则冲突和模型大小，同时保持高保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CFIRE算法在构建局部解释规则模型时可能为同一样本分配不同类别的规则，导致解释模糊性，需解决该问题以提升模型透明性和可信度。

Method: 提出一种后处理剪枝策略，移除贡献度低或覆盖范围冲突的规则，从而生成更紧凑、歧义更少的规则模型。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该剪枝策略显著减小了模型规模、降低了规则歧义性，并基本保持了原有预测性能。

Conclusion: 所提剪枝策略有效提升了CFIRE生成规则模型的清晰性与实用性，兼顾简洁性、无歧义性和保真度，适用于敏感领域的可解释性需求。

Abstract: Models trained on tabular data are widely used in sensitive domains, increasing the demand for explanation methods to meet transparency needs. CFIRE is a recent algorithm in this domain that constructs compact surrogate rule models from local explanations. While effective, CFIRE may assign rules associated with different classes to the same sample, introducing ambiguity. We investigate this ambiguity and propose a post-hoc pruning strategy that removes rules with low contribution or conflicting coverage, yielding smaller and less ambiguous models while preserving fidelity. Experiments across multiple datasets confirm these improvements with minimal impact on predictive performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种可复现的基准测试框架，系统性地在三个金融任务中比较了量子机器学习（QML）模型与结构匹配的经典模型，结果表明在数据结构与量子电路设计良好对齐时，QML模型可取得性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为公平评估当前QML模型是否能在实际金融任务中匹配或超越经典方法，需标准化数据划分、特征和评估指标。

Method: 构建可复现的基准框架，涵盖方向性收益预测、基于量子LSTM的实盘交易模拟、以及基于量子支持向量回归的已实现波动率预测，并统一数据预处理与评估标准。

Result: 在方向预测中，混合量子神经网络在AAPL和KCHOL上分别提升AUC达+3.8和+4.9；QLSTM在S&P 500四个市场状态中的两个实现更高风险调整后收益；角编码QSVR在KCHOL上取得最低QLIKE，在S&P 500和AAPL上接近最优经典核方法。

Conclusion: 当前QML架构仅在特定场景（如数据-电路协同设计良好）下具备实际优势，其余多数情形仍由经典方法主导。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a reproducible benchmarking framework that systematically compares QML models with architecture-matched classical counterparts across three financial tasks: (i) directional return prediction on U.S. and Turkish equities, (ii) live-trading simulation with Quantum LSTMs versus classical LSTMs on the S\&P 500, and (iii) realized volatility forecasting using Quantum Support Vector Regression. By standardizing data splits, features, and evaluation metrics, our study provides a fair assessment of when current-generation QML models can match or exceed classical methods. Our results reveal that quantum approaches show performance gains when data structure and circuit design are well aligned. In directional classification, hybrid quantum neural networks surpass the parameter-matched ANN by \textbf{+3.8 AUC} and \textbf{+3.4 accuracy points} on \texttt{AAPL} stock and by \textbf{+4.9 AUC} and \textbf{+3.6 accuracy points} on Turkish stock \texttt{KCHOL}. In live trading, the QLSTM achieves higher risk-adjusted returns in \textbf{two of four} S\&P~500 regimes. For volatility forecasting, an angle-encoded QSVR attains the \textbf{lowest QLIKE} on \texttt{KCHOL} and remains within $\sim$0.02-0.04 QLIKE of the best classical kernels on \texttt{S\&P~500} and \texttt{AAPL}. Our benchmarking framework clearly identifies the scenarios where current QML architectures offer tangible improvements and where established classical methods continue to dominate.

Motivation: 语义后门因缺乏明显触发模式而难以检测，现有方法多针对模式型后门；本文聚焦消费者保护场景（如监管机构‘神秘购物’式审计），需在服务提供商可控环境下验证其模型是否被恶意植入后门。

Method: 构建由少量干净与中毒模型组成的参考模型池，在可信基础设施上训练；设计并比较多种模型距离度量方法；重点采用由服务提供商执行对抗训练后的模型，并通过模型反演生成最大化偏离干净样本的输入来计算模型间距离；设定距离阈值判别模型是否中毒。

Result: 所提方法在多数情况下能完全分离干净与中毒模型，性能优于当前最优后门检测器；即使面对提供方实施的自适应攻击，该方法仍保持较强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 在具备训练数据与流程知识的监管审计场景下，基于对抗训练与反演样本驱动的模型距离检测是识别语义后门的有效且可靠途径，为可信AI治理提供了实用技术支撑。

Abstract: Detecting semantic backdoors in classification models--where some classes can be activated by certain natural, but out-of-distribution inputs--is an important problem that has received relatively little attention. Semantic backdoors are significantly harder to detect than backdoors that are based on trigger patterns due to the lack of such clearly identifiable patterns. We tackle this problem under the assumption that the clean training dataset and the training recipe of the model are both known. These assumptions are motivated by a consumer protection scenario, in which the responsible authority performs mystery shopping to test a machine learning service provider. In this scenario, the authority uses the provider's resources and tools to train a model on a given dataset and tests whether the provider included a backdoor. In our proposed approach, the authority creates a reference model pool by training a small number of clean and poisoned models using trusted infrastructure, and calibrates a model distance threshold to identify clean models. We propose and experimentally analyze a number of approaches to compute model distances and we also test a scenario where the provider performs an adaptive attack to avoid detection. The most reliable method is based on requesting adversarial training from the provider. The model distance is best measured using a set of input samples generated by inverting the models in such a way as to maximize the distance from clean samples. With these settings, our method can often completely separate clean and poisoned models, and it proves to be superior to state-of-the-art backdoor detectors as well.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GAN虽能生成高质量样本，但缺乏引入先验知识或保证逻辑一致性的机制，限制了其在需规则约束领域的应用。

Method: 提出LTN-GAN框架，将LTN与GAN结合：利用LTN将一阶逻辑约束融入GAN的损失函数或判别器中，引导生成器在保持真实感的同时满足逻辑规则。

Result: 在合成数据集（gaussian、grid、rings）和MNIST上验证，LTN-GAN在逻辑约束满足度上显著优于标准GAN，同时保持生成质量与多样性。

Conclusion: LTN-GAN展示了神经符号方法在知识密集型生成建模中的潜力，为融合逻辑推理与深度生成模型提供了可行路径。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Logic Tensor Network-Enhanced Generative Adversarial Network (LTN-GAN), a novel framework that enhances Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) by incorporating Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs) to enforce domain-specific logical constraints during the sample generation process. Although GANs have shown remarkable success in generating realistic data, they often lack mechanisms to incorporate prior knowledge or enforce logical consistency, limiting their applicability in domains requiring rule adherence. LTNs provide a principled way to integrate first-order logic with neural networks, enabling models to reason over and satisfy logical constraints. By combining the strengths of GANs for realistic data synthesis with LTNs for logical reasoning, we gain valuable insights into how logical constraints influence the generative process while improving both the diversity and logical consistency of the generated samples. We evaluate LTN-GAN across multiple datasets, including synthetic datasets (gaussian, grid, rings) and the MNIST dataset, demonstrating that our model significantly outperforms traditional GANs in terms of adherence to predefined logical constraints while maintaining the quality and diversity of generated samples. This work highlights the potential of neuro-symbolic approaches to enhance generative modeling in knowledge-intensive domains.

TL;DR: 本文提出FALCON框架，通过分层特征感知的token序列生成与知识蒸馏，提升单轮联邦学习（OSFL）在非独立同分布（non-IID）图像数据（尤其是医学影像）上的鲁棒性与性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单轮联邦学习方法在真实场景（如医学影像）中性能鲁棒性差，且处理non-IID数据效率低。

Method: FALCON采用预训练视觉编码器生成多尺度分层token序列；用多尺度自回归Transformer建模并合成token序列；客户端上传合成序列及本地分类器；服务器端通过知识蒸馏进行全局模型训练，降低对精确分布建模的依赖。

Result: 在医学与自然图像数据集上的实验表明，FALCON在多种non-IID设定下显著优于现有最优OSFL基线，平均准确率提升9.58%。

Conclusion: FALCON有效缓解了OSFL在non-IID图像数据上的性能瓶颈，为隐私敏感、通信受限的真实医疗AI场景提供了可行方案。

Abstract: One-shot federated learning (OSFL) reduces the communication cost and privacy risks of iterative federated learning by constructing a global model with a single round of communication. However, most existing methods struggle to achieve robust performance on real-world domains such as medical imaging, or are inefficient when handling non-IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) data. To address these limitations, we introduce FALCON, a framework that enhances the effectiveness of OSFL over non-IID image data. The core idea of FALCON is to leverage the feature-aware hierarchical token sequences generation and knowledge distillation into OSFL. First, each client leverages a pretrained visual encoder with hierarchical scale encoding to compress images into hierarchical token sequences, which capture multi-scale semantics. Second, a multi-scale autoregressive transformer generator is used to model the distribution of these token sequences and generate the synthetic sequences. Third, clients upload the synthetic sequences along with the local classifier trained on the real token sequences to the server. Finally, the server incorporates knowledge distillation into global training to reduce reliance on precise distribution modeling. Experiments on medical and natural image datasets validate the effectiveness of FALCON in diverse non-IID scenarios, outperforming the best OSFL baselines by 9.58% in average accuracy.

Motivation: Mixture of Experts (MoE) 架构虽能高效扩展神经网络，但存在专家坍缩问题，导致模型容量下降和适应过程中的灾难性干扰。

Method: 提出谱正则化混合专家（SR-MoE），采用双重正则化：谱范数约束限制路由函数的Lipschitz连续性，稳定秩惩罚保持专家选择中高维特征多样性。

Result: 在多种架构规模与数据集复杂度下验证，传统线性门控随深度增加性能显著下降（准确率最多下降4.72%），而SR-MoE维持结构完整性（平均干扰仅-0.32%），并支持局部专家更新与正向知识迁移。

Conclusion: SR-MoE为构建高容量、模块化、支持稳定终身学习的神经网络提供了一种通用解决方案。

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures enable efficient scaling of neural networks but suffer from expert collapse, where routing converges to a few dominant experts. This reduces model capacity and causes catastrophic interference during adaptation. We propose the Spectrally-Regularized Mixture of Experts (SR-MoE), which imposes geometric constraints on the routing manifold to enforce structural modularity. Our method uses dual regularization: spectral norm constraints bound routing function Lipschitz continuity, while stable rank penalties preserve high-dimensional feature diversity in expert selection. We evaluate SR-MoE across architectural scales and dataset complexities using modular one-shot adaptation tasks. Results show that traditional linear gating fails with increasing depth (accuracy drops up to 4.72% due to expert entanglement), while SR-MoE maintains structural integrity (mean interference -0.32%). Our spectral constraints facilitate positive knowledge transfer, enabling localized expert updates without global performance decay. SR-MoE provides a general solution for building high-capacity, modular networks capable of stable lifelong learning.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a popular algorithm for reinforcement learning with large language models (LLMs). However, upon analyzing its clipping mechanism, we argue that it is suboptimal in certain scenarios. With appropriate modifications, GRPO can be significantly enhanced to improve both flexibility and generalization. To this end, we propose Adaptive-Boundary-Clipping GRPO (ABC-GRPO), an asymmetric and adaptive refinement of the original GRPO framework. We demonstrate that ABC-GRPO achieves superior performance over standard GRPO on mathematical reasoning tasks using the Qwen3 LLMs. Moreover, ABC-GRPO maintains substantially higher entropy throughout training, thereby preserving the model's exploration capacity and mitigating premature convergence.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解浅层神经网络在逼近规则型模型（如轴对齐决策树）时，其决策边界几何简单性（即可解释性）与逼近精度之间是否存在根本性权衡。

Method: 采用Radon全变差（RTV）作为衡量单隐层ReLU网络决策边界几何复杂度的工具；分析硬指示函数、分段线性ramp、sigmoidal平滑及Gaussian卷积等不同逼近方式的RTV性质；构造具有有限RTV的光滑屏障分数S_A，并在tube-mass条件下推导L1校准误差界和RTV上界。

Conclusion: 几何简单性（低RTV）与高精度逼近轴对齐决策树并非天然兼容；需谨慎设计分数函数与阈值机制；RTV为量化神经网络可解释性与表达能力间权衡提供了严格数学框架。

Abstract: We study when geometric simplicity of decision boundaries, used here as a notion of interpretability, can conflict with accurate approximation of axis-aligned decision trees by shallow neural networks. Decision trees induce rule-based, axis-aligned decision regions (finite unions of boxes), whereas shallow ReLU networks are typically trained as score models whose predictions are obtained by thresholding. We analyze the infinite-width, bounded-norm, single-hidden-layer ReLU class through the Radon total variation ($\mathrm{R}\mathrm{TV}$) seminorm, which controls the geometric complexity of level sets.
  We first show that the hard tree indicator $1_A$ has infinite $\mathrm{R}\mathrm{TV}$. Moreover, two natural split-wise continuous surrogates--piecewise-linear ramp smoothing and sigmoidal (logistic) smoothing--also have infinite $\mathrm{R}\mathrm{TV}$ in dimensions $d>1$, while Gaussian convolution yields finite $\mathrm{R}\mathrm{TV}$ but with an explicit exponential dependence on $d$.
  We then separate two goals that are often conflated: classification after thresholding (recovering the decision set) versus score learning (learning a calibrated score close to $1_A$). For classification, we construct a smooth barrier score $S_A$ with finite $\mathrm{R}\mathrm{TV}$ whose fixed threshold $τ=1$ exactly recovers the box. Under a mild tube-mass condition near $\partial A$, we prove an $L_1(P)$ calibration bound that decays polynomially in a sharpness parameter, along with an explicit $\mathrm{R}\mathrm{TV}$ upper bound in terms of face measures. Experiments on synthetic unions of rectangles illustrate the resulting accuracy--complexity tradeoff and how threshold selection shifts where training lands along it.

*Yujie Feng,Hao Wang,Jian Li,Xu Chu,Zhaolu Kang,Yiran Liu,Yasha Wang,Philip S. Yu,Xiao-Ming Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出FOREVER框架，通过基于模型更新幅度定义的'模型时间'来对齐重放调度与LLM遗忘曲线，从而缓解持续学习中的灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有记忆回放方法依赖固定步数启发式，与模型实际学习进展不匹配；而LLM遗忘行为类似人类艾宾浩斯遗忘曲线，因此需以模型为中心设计回放机制。

Method: 提出FOREVER框架：1）用优化器更新幅度定义'模型时间'；2）基于遗忘曲线设计回放调度器；3）引入强度感知的正则化机制自适应控制回放方式。

Result: 在三个持续学习基准和0.6B至13B参数规模的模型上，FOREVER均显著缓解了灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: 以模型内部演化为时间尺度、结合遗忘曲线建模的记忆回放策略，比传统步数驱动方法更契合LLM持续学习动态，是提升CL鲁棒性的有效新范式。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) for large language models (LLMs) aims to enable sequential knowledge acquisition without catastrophic forgetting. Memory replay methods are widely used for their practicality and effectiveness, but most rely on fixed, step-based heuristics that often misalign with the model's actual learning progress, since identical training steps can result in varying degrees of parameter change. Motivated by recent findings that LLM forgetting mirrors the Ebbinghaus human forgetting curve, we propose FOREVER (FORgEtting curVe-inspired mEmory Replay), a novel CL framework that aligns replay schedules with a model-centric notion of time. FOREVER defines model time using the magnitude of optimizer updates, allowing forgetting curve-inspired replay intervals to align with the model's internal evolution rather than raw training steps. Building on this approach, FOREVER incorporates a forgetting curve-based replay scheduler to determine when to replay and an intensity-aware regularization mechanism to adaptively control how to replay. Extensive experiments on three CL benchmarks and models ranging from 0.6B to 13B parameters demonstrate that FOREVER consistently mitigates catastrophic forgetting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文使用SEER数据集构建了可解释的机器学习模型，针对结直肠癌、胃癌和肝癌的不同分期分别预测生存率，并利用SHAP和LIME方法揭示了关键特征与癌症分期之间的交互作用，提升了模型透明度与临床实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生存预测模型常混合所有癌症分期进行训练和评估，易高估性能并忽略分期特异性差异；同时，现有研究中关于模型可解释性和透明性的探索仍较缺乏。

Method: 基于SEER数据集，构建并验证面向结直肠癌、胃癌和肝癌的分期特异性可解释机器学习模型；采用SHAP和LIME等技术进行特征重要性分析与局部解释。

Result: 发现了人口统计学和临床变量对不同癌症分期生存影响的异质性，揭示了隐藏于黑箱模型中的关键特征-分期交互关系，增强了模型的临床可解释性与个性化治疗支持能力。

Conclusion: 分期特异性建模结合可解释AI方法，不仅能提升预测精度，更能提供具有临床意义的洞察，助力精准化、个体化癌症治疗决策。

Abstract: Despite the fact that cancer survivability rates vary greatly between stages, traditional survival prediction models have frequently been trained and assessed using examples from all combined phases of the disease. This method may result in an overestimation of performance and ignore the stage-specific variations. Using the SEER dataset, we created and verified explainable machine learning (ML) models to predict stage-specific cancer survivability in colorectal, stomach, and liver cancers. ML-based cancer survival analysis has been a long-standing topic in the literature; however, studies involving the explainability and transparency of ML survivability models are limited. Our use of explainability techniques, including SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), enabled us to illustrate significant feature-cancer stage interactions that would have remained hidden in traditional black-box models. We identified how certain demographic and clinical variables influenced survival differently across cancer stages and types. These insights provide not only transparency but also clinical relevance, supporting personalized treatment planning. By focusing on stage-specific models, this study provides new insights into the most important factors at each stage of cancer, offering transparency and potential clinical relevance to support personalized treatment planning.

Motivation: 提升符号回归在科学发现中的可解释性，并解决现有方法仅支持单一分类变量或有限参数共享的问题。

Method: 提出一种支持多个分类变量和中间层级参数共享（如跨某一类别共享、另一类别变化）的符号回归框架，并在合成数据和天体物理真实数据上进行验证。

Result: 在合成数据中验证了数据需求减少与迁移学习能力；在真实天体物理数据上实现了相近拟合质量但显著减少独立参数数量，并挖掘出额外问题信息。

Conclusion: 多分类变量与中间参数共享机制能有效降低模型复杂度、增强泛化能力，并为科学建模提供更丰富的结构化洞见。

Abstract: Symbolic Regression aims to find symbolic expressions that describe datasets. Due to better interpretability, it is a machine learning paradigm particularly powerful for scientific discovery. In recent years, several works have expanded the concept to allow the description of similar phenomena using a single expression with varying sets of parameters, thereby introducing categorical variables. Some previous works allow only "non-shared" (category-value-specific) parameters, and others also incorporate "shared" (category-value-agnostic) parameters. We expand upon those efforts by considering multiple categorical variables, and introducing intermediate levels of parameter sharing. With two categorical variables, an intermediate level of parameter sharing emerges, i.e., parameters which are shared across either category but change across the other. The new approach potentially decreases the number of parameters, while revealing additional information about the problem. Using a synthetic, fitting-only example, we test the limits of this setup in terms of data requirement reduction and transfer learning. As a real-world symbolic regression example, we demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach on an astrophysics dataset used in a previous study, which considered only one categorical variable. We achieve a similar fit quality but require significantly fewer individual parameters, and extract additional information about the problem.

Motivation: 传统优化与启发式方法难以应对连杆机构设计中连续位姿、离散拓扑与非线性运动学约束之间的强耦合及组合爆炸问题。

Method: 构建一个融合因果Transformer与去噪扩散概率模型（DDPM）的自回归框架：因果Transformer逐节点生成图拓扑（离散结构），DDPM同步优化各节点空间坐标与边连接关系（连续几何），二者均以目标轨迹的Transformer编码为条件；支持对运动锁死或碰撞等失效节点进行选择性重生成。

Result: 成功合成含最多20个关节的连杆机构，方法可扩展至N节点架构，在逆向设计任务中展现出优于传统优化方法的可扩展性与泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该工作建立了面向复杂机械系统的可扩展逆向设计新范式，推动了自回归图生成与计算运动学综合的发展。

Abstract: Designing mechanical linkages to achieve target end-effector trajectories presents a fundamental challenge due to the intricate coupling between continuous node placements, discrete topological configurations, and nonlinear kinematic constraints. The highly nonlinear motion-to-configuration relationship means small perturbations in joint positions drastically alter trajectories, while the combinatorially expanding design space renders conventional optimization and heuristic methods computationally intractable. We introduce an autoregressive diffusion framework that exploits the dyadic nature of linkage assembly by representing mechanisms as sequentially constructed graphs, where nodes correspond to joints and edges to rigid links. Our approach combines a causal transformer with a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), both conditioned on target trajectories encoded via a transformer encoder. The causal transformer autoregressively predicts discrete topology node-by-node, while the DDPM refines each node's spatial coordinates and edge connectivity to previously generated nodes. This sequential generation enables adaptive trial-and-error synthesis where problematic nodes exhibiting kinematic locking or collisions can be selectively regenerated, allowing autonomous correction of degenerate configurations during design. Our graph-based, data-driven methodology surpasses traditional optimization approaches, enabling scalable inverse design that generalizes to mechanisms with arbitrary node counts. We demonstrate successful synthesis of linkage systems containing up to 20 nodes with extensibility to N-node architectures. This work advances autoregressive graph generation methodologies and computational kinematic synthesis, establishing new paradigms for scalable inverse design of complex mechanical systems.

Motivation: 超宽带雷达用于无感居家睡眠监测前景广阔，但雷达睡眠数据稀缺，导致模型泛化能力差、难以跨人群和环境推广。

Method: 构建端到端神经网络，联合使用大规模PSG数据和雷达数据进行训练，并引入基于对抗学习的域自适应方法，弥合PSG与雷达信号之间的特征分布差异。

Result: 在47名老年人（含18例阿尔茨海默病前期或轻度患者）的雷达数据集上，实现觉醒、REM、浅睡、深睡四类分期准确率79.5%，Kappa系数0.65，性能显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该迁移学习框架有效缓解了雷达睡眠数据量少和个体差异大带来的建模难题，显著提升了自动睡眠分期模型的鲁棒性与可靠性，为神经退行性疾病人群的无感长期睡眠评估提供了可行技术路径。

Abstract: Objective: Ultra-wideband radar technology offers a promising solution for unobtrusive and cost-effective in-home sleep monitoring. However, the limited availability of radar sleep data poses challenges in building robust models that generalize across diverse cohorts and environments. This study proposes a novel deep transfer learning framework to enhance sleep stage classification using radar data. Methods: An end-to-end neural network was developed to classify sleep stages based on nocturnal respiratory and motion signals. The network was trained using a combination of large-scale polysomnography (PSG) datasets and radar data. A domain adaptation approach employing adversarial learning was utilized to bridge the knowledge gap between PSG and radar signals. Validation was performed on a radar dataset of 47 older adults (mean age: 71.2), including 18 participants with prodromal or mild Alzheimer disease. Results: The proposed network structure achieves an accuracy of 79.5% with a Kappa value of 0.65 when classifying wakefulness, rapid eye movement, light sleep and deep sleep. Experimental results confirm that our deep transfer learning approach significantly enhances automatic sleep staging performance in the target domain. Conclusion: This method effectively addresses challenges associated with data variability and limited sample size, substantially improving the reliability of automatic sleep staging models, especially in contexts where radar data is limited. Significance: The findings underscore the viability of UWB radar as a nonintrusive, forward-looking sleep assessment tool that could significantly benefit care for older people and people with neurodegenerative disorders.

Motivation: 解决由不同非线性动力系统生成的轨迹数据分类问题，需衡量轨迹与底层动力学之间的相似性。

Method: 提出基于核的Dynafit方法，利用核技巧近似Koopman算子以实现动力系统在高维（甚至无穷维）特征空间中的全局线性化，并据此定义轨迹间距离度量；支持结合先验动力学知识定制核函数。

Result: 在混沌检测（logistic映射）、手写动力学识别和视觉动态纹理识别三个任务上验证了方法有效性。

Conclusion: Dynafit是一种通用、灵活且有效的非线性动力系统轨迹分类方法，适用于含传感器数据的多种实际场景。

Abstract: We address the problem of classifying trajectory data generated by some nonlinear dynamics, where each class corresponds to a distinct dynamical system. We propose Dynafit, a kernel-based method for learning a distance metric between training trajectories and the underlying dynamics. New observations are assigned to the class with the most similar dynamics according to the learned metric. The learning algorithm approximates the Koopman operator which globally linearizes the dynamics in a (potentially infinite) feature space associated with a kernel function. The distance metric is computed in feature space independently of its dimensionality by using the kernel trick common in machine learning. We also show that the kernel function can be tailored to incorporate partial knowledge of the dynamics when available. Dynafit is applicable to various classification tasks involving nonlinear dynamical systems and sensors. We illustrate its effectiveness on three examples: chaos detection with the logistic map, recognition of handwritten dynamics and of visual dynamic textures.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于白细胞形态分析的联邦学习框架，旨在解决低收入和中等收入国家血液形态学自动分析中因染色差异、成像变化和罕见形态导致的数据集偏移问题，同时避免了中心化数据共享带来的隐私风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化血液形态分析在低收入和中等收入国家具有重要临床价值，但易受染色、成像及罕见形态引起的分布偏移影响；而构建集中式多样化数据集又受限于隐私法规和数据共享限制。

Method: 提出一种联邦学习框架，支持多机构协作训练白细胞形态分析模型，不交换原始训练数据，利用来自多个临床站点的血涂片数据学习鲁棒且域不变的表征。

Result: 在卷积网络和Transformer架构上评估表明，联邦训练相比集中训练具有更强的跨站点性能和对未见机构的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 联邦学习是一种实用、隐私保护的方案，有助于在资源有限的医疗环境中开发公平、可扩展且泛化能力强的医学影像AI系统。

Abstract: Automated blood morphology analysis can support hematological diagnostics in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) but remains sensitive to dataset shifts from staining variability, imaging differences, and rare morphologies. Building centralized datasets to capture this diversity is often infeasible due to privacy regulations and data-sharing restrictions. We introduce a federated learning framework for white blood cell morphology analysis that enables collaborative training across institutions without exchanging training data. Using blood films from multiple clinical sites, our federated models learn robust, domain-invariant representations while preserving complete data privacy. Evaluations across convolutional and transformer-based architectures show that federated training achieves strong cross-site performance and improved generalization to unseen institutions compared to centralized training. These findings highlight federated learning as a practical and privacy-preserving approach for developing equitable, scalable, and generalizable medical imaging AI in resource-limited healthcare environments.

TL;DR: 本文提出CausalMixFT方法，利用结构因果模型（SCM）生成结构一致的合成样本，以增强数据稀缺场景下表格基础模型（TFM）微调的鲁棒性和下游性能。实验表明其显著提升ROC-AUC并改善验证-测试性能相关性，从而提高早停可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数据稀缺情况下，表格基础模型（TFM）微调面临验证集更小、早停难以反映真实泛化能力的问题。

Method: 基于目标数据集拟合结构因果模型（SCM），生成保持特征依赖关系的因果感知合成样本，用于扩充训练数据，提升微调稳定性与性能。

Result: 在33个分类数据集、2300多次微调实验中，CausalMixFT将中位归一化ROC-AUC从0.10提升至0.12，并将验证-测试性能相关性差距从中位0.67缩小至0.30，优于CTGAN、TabEBM和TableAugment等统计生成方法。

Conclusion: 将因果结构引入数据增强，为低数据场景下的表格基础模型微调提供了有效且有原则的解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning tabular foundation models (TFMs) under data scarcity is challenging, as early stopping on even scarcer validation data often fails to capture true generalization performance. We propose CausalMixFT, a method that enhances fine-tuning robustness and downstream performance by generating structurally consistent synthetic samples using Structural Causal Models (SCMs) fitted on the target dataset. This approach augments limited real data with causally informed synthetic examples, preserving feature dependencies while expanding training diversity. Evaluated across 33 classification datasets from TabArena and over 2300 fine-tuning runs, our CausalMixFT method consistently improves median normalized ROC-AUC from 0.10 (standard fine-tuning) to 0.12, outperforming purely statistical generators such as CTGAN (-0.01), TabEBM (-0.04), and TableAugment (-0.09). Moreover, it narrows the median validation-test performance correlation gap from 0.67 to 0.30, enabling more reliable validation-based early stopping, a key step toward improving fine-tuning stability under data scarcity. These results demonstrate that incorporating causal structure into data augmentation provides an effective and principled route to fine-tuning tabular foundation models in low-data regimes.

TL;DR: 本文提出了MEDS-OWL本体及配套工具meds2rdf，将医疗事件数据标准（MEDS）映射为符合语义网标准的RDF图，提升临床事件数据的FAIR性、可追溯性与互操作性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习在医疗数据中的应用受限于缺乏标准化和语义明确的数据表示，导致跨数据集和实验的互操作性与可复现性差。

Method: 构建轻量级OWL本体MEDS-OWL，并开发Python转换库meds2rdf，将MEDS格式事件数据自动转为符合该本体的RDF图；使用SHACL约束验证生成图的正确性。

Result: 首版MEDS-OWL包含13个类、10个对象属性、20个数据属性和24条OWL公理；在破裂颅内动脉瘤合成临床数据集上成功实现转换与验证，支持FAIR数据发布与图分析。

Conclusion: MEDS-OWL与meds2rdf共同构建了连接MEDS与语义网的可复用语义层，为基于图的临床数据分析奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: The application of machine learning on healthcare data is often hindered by the lack of standardized and semantically explicit representation, leading to limited interoperability and reproducibility across datasets and experiments. The Medical Event Data Standard (MEDS) addresses these issues by introducing a minimal, event-centric data model designed for reproducible machine-learning workflows from health data. However, MEDS is defined as a data-format specification and does not natively provide integration with the Semantic Web ecosystem. In this article, we introduce MEDS-OWL, a lightweight OWL ontology that provides formal concepts and relations to enable representing MEDS datasets as RDF graphs. Additionally, we implemented meds2rdf, a Python conversion library that transforms MEDS events into RDF graphs, ensuring conformance with the ontology. We demonstrate the approach on a synthetic clinical dataset that describes patient care pathways for ruptured intracranial aneurysms and validate the resulting graph using SHACL constraints. The first release of MEDS-OWL comprises 13 classes, 10 object properties, 20 data properties, and 24 OWL axioms. Combined with meds2rdf, it enables data transformation into FAIR-aligned datasets, provenance-aware publishing, and interoperability of event-based clinical data. By bridging MEDS with the Semantic Web, this work contributes a reusable semantic layer for event-based clinical data and establishes a robust foundation for subsequent graph-based analytics.

TL;DR: 本文提出Agentic Rubrics方法，通过专家代理与代码库交互生成上下文感知的评分清单，用于在不执行测试的情况下评估候选补丁，从而实现可扩展、可解释且细粒度的软件工程代理验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有软件工程代理验证方法依赖代码执行，存在环境配置开销大、难以扩展的问题；而替代方案（如补丁分类器和启发式方法）缺乏代码库上下文支持且可解释性差。

Method: 设计Agentic Rubrics：由专家代理与仓库交互生成上下文相关的评分清单，再基于该清单对候选补丁打分，无需运行测试；并在SWE-Bench Verified上进行并行Test-Time Scaling评估。

Result: 在SWE-Bench Verified上，Agentic Rubrics在Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B和Qwen3-32B模型上分别达到54.2%和40.6%准确率，较最强基线提升至少3.5个百分点；分析表明其评分既与真实测试一致，又能发现测试未覆盖的问题。

Conclusion: Agentic Rubrics提供了一种高效、可扩展、细粒度且可解释的软件工程代理验证信号，其中代理式上下文采集对生成代码库特异、无歧义的评估标准至关重要。

Abstract: Verification is critical for improving agents: it provides the reward signal for Reinforcement Learning and enables inference-time gains through Test-Time Scaling (TTS). Despite its importance, verification in software engineering (SWE) agent settings often relies on code execution, which can be difficult to scale due to environment setup overhead. Scalable alternatives such as patch classifiers and heuristic methods exist, but they are less grounded in codebase context and harder to interpret. To this end, we explore Agentic Rubrics: an expert agent interacts with the repository to create a context-grounded rubric checklist, and candidate patches are then scored against it without requiring test execution. On SWE-Bench Verified under parallel TTS evaluation, Agentic Rubrics achieve a score of 54.2% on Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B and 40.6% on Qwen3-32B, with at least a +3.5 percentage-point gain over the strongest baseline in our comparison set. We further analyze rubric behavior, showing that rubric scores are consistent with ground-truth tests while also flagging issues that tests do not capture. Our ablations show that agentic context gathering is essential for producing codebase-specific, unambiguous criteria. Together, these results suggest that Agentic Rubrics provide an efficient, scalable, and granular verification signal for SWE agents.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合物理信息神经网络（PINNs）与自动微分的深度学习框架，用于在强噪声条件下从非线性薛定谔方程（NLSE）中高精度反演非线性系数beta，仅需500个稀疏、含20%高斯噪声的数据点即可实现<0.2%相对误差，显著优于传统有限差分法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值方法（如有限差分）在处理含噪稀疏实验数据时因数值微分放大噪声而失效，亟需鲁棒性强、适用于小样本高噪声场景的物理参数反演新方法。

Method: 将物理信息神经网络（PINNs）与自动微分相结合，构建端到端可微框架，以NLSE控制方程作为软约束进行正则化，在仅有稀疏、带20%高斯噪声的时空数据下直接学习并反演非线性系数beta。

Result: 在beta∈[0.5,2.0]、训练点数100–1000、20%加性高斯噪声条件下，beta反演误差稳定低于1%；beta=1.0时多次独立运行标准差<0.15%；500点输入下相对误差<0.2%；单次运行耗时约80分钟（Tesla T4 GPU）。

Conclusion: 物理信息正则化能有效抑制测量不确定性，PINNs为稀疏、高噪声时空动力学逆问题提供了鲁棒、高效且实用的新范式，具备良好泛化性与可复现性。

Abstract: We demonstrate a deep learning framework capable of recovering physical parameters from the Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation (NLSE) under severe noise conditions. By integrating Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with automatic differentiation, we achieve reconstruction of the nonlinear coefficient beta with less than 0.2 percent relative error using only 500 sparse, randomly sampled data points corrupted by 20 percent additive Gaussian noise, a regime where traditional finite difference methods typically fail due to noise amplification in numerical derivatives. We validate the method's generalization capabilities across different physical regimes (beta between 0.5 and 2.0) and varying data availability (between 100 and 1000 training points), demonstrating consistent sub-1 percent accuracy. Statistical analysis over multiple independent runs confirms robustness (standard deviation less than 0.15 percent for beta equals 1.0). The complete pipeline executes in approximately 80 minutes on modest cloud GPU resources (NVIDIA Tesla T4), making the approach accessible for widespread adoption. Our results indicate that physics-based regularization acts as an effective filter against high measurement uncertainty, positioning PINNs as a viable alternative to traditional optimization methods for inverse problems in spatiotemporal dynamics where experimental data is scarce and noisy. All code is made publicly available to facilitate reproducibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表面肌电信号（sEMG）长期解码受限于电极偏移、肌肉疲劳和姿势变化引起的信号漂移；现有方法依赖大数据集或高算力，难以部署于能量受限的可穿戴设备。

Method: 提出基于TCN的轻量级测试时自适应（TTA）框架，包含三种部署就绪策略：(i) 因果自适应批归一化实现实时统计对齐；(ii) 带经验回放的高斯混合模型（GMM）对齐防止遗忘；(iii) 元学习实现少样本快速校准。

Result: 在NinaPro DB6多会话数据集上验证，该框架显著缩小跨会话准确率差距；经验回放更新在小样本下更稳定，元学习在1-shot/2-shot场景下仅用极少量数据即达竞争性能。

Conclusion: 该工作为面向长期假肢应用的鲁棒、即插即用式肌电控制提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Reliable long-term decoding of surface electromyography (EMG) is hindered by signal drift caused by electrode shifts, muscle fatigue, and posture changes. While state-of-the-art models achieve high intra-session accuracy, their performance often degrades sharply. Existing solutions typically demand large datasets or high-compute pipelines that are impractical for energy-efficient wearables. We propose a lightweight framework for Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) using a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) backbone. We introduce three deployment-ready strategies: (i) causal adaptive batch normalization for real-time statistical alignment; (ii) a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) alignment with experience replay to prevent forgetting; and (iii) meta-learning for rapid, few-shot calibration. Evaluated on the NinaPro DB6 multi-session dataset, our framework significantly bridges the inter-session accuracy gap with minimal overhead. Our results show that experience-replay updates yield superior stability under limited data, while meta-learning achieves competitive performance in one- and two-shot regimes using only a fraction of the data required by current benchmarks. This work establishes a path toward robust, "plug-and-play" myoelectric control for long-term prosthetic use.

TL;DR: QZero is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that masters Go through self-play and off-policy experience replay, achieving AlphaGo-level performance without search or human data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that model-free reinforcement learning can efficiently master complex strategic games like Go without relying on model-based search methods such as MCTS.

Method: QZero uses entropy-regularized Q-learning with a single Q-value network for unified policy evaluation and improvement, trained via self-play and off-policy experience replay, starting from scratch (tabula rasa).

Result: QZero achieved performance comparable to AlphaGo after 5 months of training on 7 GPUs, without using Monte-Carlo Tree Search or human data.

Conclusion: Model-free reinforcement learning is both efficient and feasible for mastering large-scale, complex environments like Go, challenging the necessity of model-based search in high-level strategic reasoning.

Abstract: The game of Go has long served as a benchmark for artificial intelligence, demanding sophisticated strategic reasoning and long-term planning. Previous approaches such as AlphaGo and its successors, have predominantly relied on model-based Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). In this work, we present QZero, a novel model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that forgoes search during training and learns a Nash equilibrium policy through self-play and off-policy experience replay. Built upon entropy-regularized Q-learning, QZero utilizes a single Q-value network to unify policy evaluation and improvement. Starting tabula rasa without human data and trained for 5 months with modest compute resources (7 GPUs), QZero achieved a performance level comparable to that of AlphaGo. This demonstrates, for the first time, the efficiency of using model-free reinforcement learning to master the game of Go, as well as the feasibility of off-policy reinforcement learning in solving large-scale and complex environments.

*Akarsh Kumar,Ryan Bahlous-Boldi,Prafull Sharma,Phillip Isola,Sebastian Risi,Yujin Tang,David Ha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Digital Red Queen（DRQ）的LLM自博弈演化算法，通过在Core War这一图灵完备环境中持续演化对抗性程序（warriors），模拟‘红皇后’动态演化过程，并观察到程序向通用性和收敛性策略演化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM演化框架多为静态优化问题，忽视真实进化中开放、对抗性的动态特性；本文旨在引入动态、自适应的‘红皇后’演化机制。

Method: 提出DRQ算法：利用LLM在Core War虚拟机环境中，每轮演化出能击败所有历史warrior的新warrior，形成持续对抗的自博弈演化链。

Result: warrior随轮次增加展现出更强的泛化能力（对人类设计warrior的胜率提升），且跨独立运行的行为多样性下降，呈现收敛趋势，类比自然界的趋同进化。

Conclusion: 动态红皇后目标比静态目标更利于激发LLM演化出鲁棒、通用的对抗策略；Core War是研究人工系统对抗演化的理想沙盒，DRQ的简洁性也暗示其可拓展至网络安全、抗药性等现实多智能体对抗场景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to evolve solutions to problems in many domains, in a process inspired by biological evolution. However, unlike biological evolution, most LLM-evolution frameworks are formulated as static optimization problems, overlooking the open-ended adversarial dynamics that characterize real-world evolutionary processes. Here, we study Digital Red Queen (DRQ), a simple self-play algorithm that embraces these so-called "Red Queen" dynamics via continual adaptation to a changing objective. DRQ uses an LLM to evolve assembly-like programs, called warriors, which compete against each other for control of a virtual machine in the game of Core War, a Turing-complete environment studied in artificial life and connected to cybersecurity. In each round of DRQ, the model evolves a new warrior to defeat all previous ones, producing a sequence of adapted warriors. Over many rounds, we observe that warriors become increasingly general (relative to a set of held-out human warriors). Interestingly, warriors also become less behaviorally diverse across independent runs, indicating a convergence pressure toward a general-purpose behavioral strategy, much like convergent evolution in nature. This result highlights a potential value of shifting from static objectives to dynamic Red Queen objectives. Our work positions Core War as a rich, controllable sandbox for studying adversarial adaptation in artificial systems and for evaluating LLM-based evolution methods. More broadly, the simplicity and effectiveness of DRQ suggest that similarly minimal self-play approaches could prove useful in other more practical multi-agent adversarial domains, like real-world cybersecurity or combating drug resistance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多智能体工作流，将主任务描述与形式约束的优化解耦，利用量化反馈迭代重写提示，显著提升大模型对形式约束的遵循能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型常生成内容相关但违反形式约束的输出，而传统提示优化方法忽视了作为响应验收标准的细粒度约束。

Method: 提出一种多智能体工作流，分离主任务描述与约束的优化，并以量化评分为反馈进行迭代重写。

Result: 在Llama 3.1 8B和Mixtral-8x 7B等模型上，该方法生成的修订提示显著提高了约束遵循得分。

Conclusion: 解耦任务与约束的优化并引入量化反馈机制，可有效提升LLM对形式化约束的遵守能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate substantively relevant content but fail to adhere to formal constraints, leading to outputs that are conceptually correct but procedurally flawed. Traditional prompt refinement approaches focus on rephrasing the description of the primary task an LLM has to perform, neglecting the granular constraints that function as acceptance criteria for its response. We propose a novel multi-agentic workflow that decouples optimization of the primary task description from its constraints, using quantitative scores as feedback to iteratively rewrite and improve them. Our evaluation demonstrates this method produces revised prompts that yield significantly higher compliance scores from models like Llama 3.1 8B and Mixtral-8x 7B.

Conclusion: 自我意识（以疼痛信念为代理）可有效提升强化学习智能体的学习能力与行为复杂性，支持自我-他人意识统一系统的计算可行性。

Abstract: Understanding how artificial agents model internal mental states is central to advancing Theory of Mind in AI. Evidence points to a unified system for self- and other-awareness. We explore this self-awareness by having reinforcement learning agents infer their own internal states in gridworld environments. Specifically, we introduce an introspective exploration component that is inspired by biological pain as a learning signal by utilizing a hidden Markov model to infer "pain-belief" from online observations. This signal is integrated into a subjective reward function to study how self-awareness affects the agent's learning abilities. Further, we use this computational framework to investigate the difference in performance between normal and chronic pain perception models. Results show that introspective agents in general significantly outperform standard baseline agents and can replicate complex human-like behaviors.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出CPGPrompt，一种将叙事性临床实践指南（CPGs）自动转化为大语言模型（LLM）可执行决策树的系统，旨在提升AI对指南的可解释性、依从性与泛化能力；在二分类转诊决策上表现优异（F1达0.85–1.00），但在多路径分类任务中性能因指南结构差异而波动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于规则的CPG集成方法存在可解释性差、指南依从性不一致、适用领域窄等问题，亟需更鲁棒、可解释且可扩展的AI集成方案。

Method: 构建CPGPrompt框架：将叙事性CPGs自动解析为结构化决策树，并利用LLM动态遍历该树以评估患者病例；在头痛、腰痛和前列腺癌三个领域生成合成病例 vignettes，覆盖四类决策场景，评估二分类转诊决策与多类路径分配任务。

Result: 二分类专科转诊任务F1达0.85–1.00，召回率恒为1.00；多类路径分配F1分别为头痛0.47、腰痛0.72、前列腺癌0.77；性能差异源于各指南结构特性：头痛指南受否定表达影响大，腰痛需时序推理，前列腺癌因量化检验指标而更稳定。

Conclusion: CPGPrompt有效提升了LLM对CPGs的结构化理解与临床决策支持能力，尤其适用于高召回要求的转诊判断；未来需增强对否定表达、时序逻辑等复杂语义的建模能力。

Abstract: Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) provide evidence-based recommendations for patient care; however, integrating them into Artificial Intelligence (AI) remains challenging. Previous approaches, such as rule-based systems, face significant limitations, including poor interpretability, inconsistent adherence to guidelines, and narrow domain applicability. To address this, we develop and validate CPGPrompt, an auto-prompting system that converts narrative clinical guidelines into large language models (LLMs).
  Our framework translates CPGs into structured decision trees and utilizes an LLM to dynamically navigate them for patient case evaluation. Synthetic vignettes were generated across three domains (headache, lower back pain, and prostate cancer) and distributed into four categories to test different decision scenarios. System performance was assessed on both binary specialty-referral decisions and fine-grained pathway-classification tasks.
  The binary specialty referral classification achieved consistently strong performance across all domains (F1: 0.85-1.00), with high recall (1.00 $\pm$ 0.00). In contrast, multi-class pathway assignment showed reduced performance, with domain-specific variations: headache (F1: 0.47), lower back pain (F1: 0.72), and prostate cancer (F1: 0.77). Domain-specific performance differences reflected the structure of each guideline. The headache guideline highlighted challenges with negation handling. The lower back pain guideline required temporal reasoning. In contrast, prostate cancer pathways benefited from quantifiable laboratory tests, resulting in more reliable decision-making.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了大型基础模型（LFMs）在个性化医疗中的局限性，指出其虽擅长从群体数据中快速生成假设，但无法替代N-of-1试验进行个体因果验证；提出LFMs与N-of-1试验互补的混合框架，以兼顾预测能力与因果推断，应对隐私-性能、泛化-个性化等多重悖论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型基础模型在个性化医疗中是否真能提供可靠个体化治疗推荐的开放问题，厘清其在因果理解、外部有效性、隐私与自动化等方面的固有张力。

Method: 通过概念分析与范式对比，系统识别AI医疗中的四大悖论，并论证LFMs与N-of-1试验的功能边界与互补性，进而提出‘LFM生成候选干预→触发N-of-1验证’的混合框架。

Result: 明确了LFMs不能替代N-of-1试验，二者应协同：LFMs用于多模态数据驱动的快速假设生成与不确定性量化，N-of-1试验用于个体层面因果验证；该框架可缓解多个根本性悖论。

Conclusion: 负责任地将AI融入个性化医学，关键在于清晰区分预测与因果，并主动设计机制（如混合框架）来调和内在悖论；LFMs的价值在于赋能而非取代个体化因果推理。

Abstract: Large foundation models (LFMs) transform healthcare AI in prevention, diagnostics, and treatment. However, whether LFMs can provide truly personalized treatment recommendations remains an open question. Recent research has revealed multiple challenges for personalization, including the fundamental generalizability paradox: models achieving high accuracy in one clinical study perform at chance level in others, demonstrating that personalization and external validity exist in tension. This exemplifies broader contradictions in AI-driven healthcare: the privacy-performance paradox, scale-specificity paradox, and the automation-empathy paradox. As another challenge, the degree of causal understanding required for personalized recommendations, as opposed to mere predictive capacities of LFMs, remains an open question. N-of-1 trials -- crossover self-experiments and the gold standard for individual causal inference in personalized medicine -- resolve these tensions by providing within-person causal evidence while preserving privacy through local experimentation. Despite their impressive capabilities, this paper argues that LFMs cannot replace N-of-1 trials. We argue that LFMs and N-of-1 trials are complementary: LFMs excel at rapid hypothesis generation from population patterns using multimodal data, while N-of-1 trials excel at causal validation for a given individual. We propose a hybrid framework that combines the strengths of both to enable personalization and navigate the identified paradoxes: LFMs generate ranked intervention candidates with uncertainty estimates, which trigger subsequent N-of-1 trials. Clarifying the boundary between prediction and causation and explicitly addressing the paradoxical tensions are essential for responsible AI integration in personalized medicine.

Method: 提出程序化技能网络（PSN），将技能表示为可执行符号程序构成的组合网络；引入基于大语言模型的三种机制：REFLECT（结构化故障定位）、成熟度感知的渐进式优化更新门控、以及带回滚验证的规范结构重构。

Result: 在MineDojo和Crafter环境中的实验表明PSN具备鲁棒的技能复用能力、快速任务适应能力，以及对开放式任务分布的强泛化性能；其学习动力学与神经网络训练存在结构相似性。

Conclusion: PSN为开放环境中的持续技能学习提供了一种兼具符号可解释性与大模型驱动能力的新范式，平衡了技能稳定性与演化可塑性。

Abstract: We study continual skill acquisition in open-ended embodied environments where an agent must construct, refine, and reuse an expanding library of executable skills. We introduce the Programmatic Skill Network (PSN), a framework in which skills are executable symbolic programs forming a compositional network that evolves through experience. PSN defines three core mechanisms instantiated via large language models: (1)REFLECT for structured fault localization over skill compositions, (2) progressive optimization with maturity-aware update gating that stabilizes reliable skills while maintaining plasticity for uncertain ones, and (3) canonical structural refactoring under rollback validation that maintains network compactness. We further show that PSN's learning dynamics exhibit structural parallels to neural network training. Experiments on MineDojo and Crafter demonstrate robust skill reuse, rapid adaptation, and strong generalization across open-ended task distributions.\footnote{We plan to open-source the code.

TL;DR: 本文研究加权模型计数（WMC）结果的方差计算问题，提出在结构化d-DNNF上可在多项式时间内计算WMC方差，但对结构化DNNF、d-DNNF和FBDD则为#P难；并将其应用于贝叶斯网络推理不确定性量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际推理任务中模型参数存在不确定性（常由数据学习得到），需评估推理结果的不确定性；将参数视为随机变量后，推理结果成为随机变量，其方差可度量不确定性，但该方差计算的可行性尚不明确。

Method: 1）推导结构化d-DNNF输入下WMC方差的多项式时间算法；2）证明该方差计算在结构化DNNF、d-DNNF和FBDD上的#P难性；3）将方法应用于贝叶斯网络推理的不确定性分析。

Result: 1）结构化d-DNNF上WMC方差可多项式时间求解；2）结构化DNNF、d-DNNF和FBDD上该问题为#P难；3）在真实贝叶斯网络上验证了算法有效性，并分析了参数方差对边际概率方差的影响。

Conclusion: WMC方差计算的复杂性高度依赖于知识编译语言的结构限制；结构化d-DNNF提供了兼顾表达能力与方差可算性的良好折中，为不确定性感知推理提供了新工具。

Abstract: One of the most important queries in knowledge compilation is weighted model counting (WMC), which has been applied to probabilistic inference on various models, such as Bayesian networks. In practical situations on inference tasks, the model's parameters have uncertainty because they are often learned from data, and thus we want to compute the degree of uncertainty in the inference outcome. One possible approach is to regard the inference outcome as a random variable by introducing distributions for the parameters and evaluate the variance of the outcome. Unfortunately, the tractability of computing such a variance is hardly known. Motivated by this, we consider the problem of computing the variance of WMC and investigate this problem's tractability. First, we derive a polynomial time algorithm to evaluate the WMC variance when the input is given as a structured d-DNNF. Second, we prove the hardness of this problem for structured DNNFs, d-DNNFs, and FBDDs, which is intriguing because the latter two allow polynomial time WMC algorithms. Finally, we show an application that measures the uncertainty in the inference of Bayesian networks. We empirically show that our algorithm can evaluate the variance of the marginal probability on real-world Bayesian networks and analyze the impact of the variances of parameters on the variance of the marginal.

Motivation: 确定何种形式的安全推理能有效防御越狱攻击存在困难，难以显式设计或直接获取。

Method: 提出STAR-S（基于安全规则的自我教学推理）框架，将安全规则推理学习整合进自我教学循环：通过安全规则引导推理与反思，再利用微调增强安全推理能力，并重复该过程形成协同循环。

Result: 实验表明STAR-S能有效防御越狱攻击，性能优于基线方法。

Conclusion: STAR-S通过自我教学循环提升模型对安全规则的理解与推理能力，是一种有效的越狱攻击防御方法。

Abstract: Defending against jailbreak attacks is crucial for the safe deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent research has attempted to improve safety by training models to reason over safety rules before responding. However, a key issue lies in determining what form of safety reasoning effectively defends against jailbreak attacks, which is difficult to explicitly design or directly obtain. To address this, we propose \textbf{STAR-S} (\textbf{S}elf-\textbf{TA}ught \textbf{R}easoning based on \textbf{S}afety rules), a framework that integrates the learning of safety rule reasoning into a self-taught loop. The core of STAR-S involves eliciting reasoning and reflection guided by safety rules, then leveraging fine-tuning to enhance safety reasoning. Repeating this process creates a synergistic cycle. Improvements in the model's reasoning and interpretation of safety rules allow it to produce better reasoning data under safety rule prompts, which is then utilized for further training. Experiments show that STAR-S effectively defends against jailbreak attacks, outperforming baselines. Code is available at: https://github.com/pikepokenew/STAR_S.git.

Motivation: 当前链式思维（CoT）评估方法无法区分LLM性能提升源于真实推理能力还是单纯增加输出长度（verbosity），亟需更精准的过程性评估手段。

Method: 提出一种非侵入式的神经符号框架，进行过程中心的推理评估；识别行为原型并诊断失败模式；系统分析推理模式、训练策略与模型规模的影响。

Result: 发现扩展token生成并非深度推理的必要条件；混合长短CoT训练易导致早熟饱和与崩溃；小模型蒸馏可继承行为长度但无法复现逻辑有效性，受限于固有容量。

Conclusion: 推理质量不能以输出长度衡量；需过程导向的评估范式；训练数据构成与模型容量对逻辑效能具有根本性影响。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle complex reasoning, yet the limitations of current Chain-of-Thought (CoT) evaluation obscures whether performance gains stem from genuine reasoning or mere verbosity. To address this, (1) we propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework for the non-intrusive, comprehensive process-centric evaluation of reasoning. (2) Through this lens, we identify four distinct behavioral prototypes and diagnose the failure modes. (3) We examine the impact of inference mode, training strategy, and model scale. Our analysis reveals that extended token generation is not a prerequisite for deep reasoning. Furthermore, we reveal critical constraints: mixing long and short CoT data in training risks in premature saturation and collapse, while distillation into smaller models captures behavioral length but fails to replicate logical efficacy due to intrinsic capacity limits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的评判器因缺乏细粒度、任务特定的评分标准，难以区分高层规划与底层执行，导致奖励信号噪声大、不一致，使得训练可靠的工具增强型智能体面临挑战。

Method: 提出SCRIBE框架，在中层抽象级别进行干预：构建技能原型库，将每个子目标映射到对应原型，将开放式的LLM评价转化为受约束的验证问题，从而为奖励模型提供精确、结构化的评分标准。

Result: 在多个推理与工具使用基准上达到SOTA；Qwen3-4B模型在AIME25上的准确率从43.3%提升至63.3%；显著提高复杂多轮工具交互成功率；训练动态分析揭示中层技能掌握先于高层规划行为涌现；SCRIBE可与底层工具优化协同增效。

Conclusion: SCRIBE通过技能条件化与中间行为评估，有效降低奖励方差，提供了一条可扩展、互补的路径，推动更自主、更可靠的工具使用智能体发展。

Abstract: Training reliable tool-augmented agents remains a significant challenge, largely due to the difficulty of credit assignment in multi-step reasoning. While process-level reward models offer a promising direction, existing LLM-based judges often produce noisy and inconsistent signals because they lack fine-grained, task-specific rubrics to distinguish high-level planning from low-level execution. In this work, we introduce SCRIBE (Skill-Conditioned Reward with Intermediate Behavioral Evaluation), a reinforcement learning framework that intervenes at a novel mid-level abstraction. SCRIBE grounds reward modeling in a curated library of skill prototypes, transforming open-ended LLM evaluation into a constrained verification problem. By routing each subgoal to a corresponding prototype, the reward model is equipped with precise, structured rubrics that substantially reduce reward variance.
  Experimental results show that SCRIBE achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of reasoning and tool-use benchmarks. In particular, it improves the AIME25 accuracy of a Qwen3-4B model from 43.3% to 63.3%, and significantly increases success rates in complex multi-turn tool interactions.
  Further analysis of training dynamics reveals a co-evolution across abstraction levels, where mastery of mid-level skills consistently precedes the emergence of effective high-level planning behaviors. Finally, we demonstrate that SCRIBE is additive to low-level tool optimizations, providing a scalable and complementary pathway toward more autonomous and reliable tool-using agents.

TL;DR: 本文提出SAE-Steering方法，利用稀疏自编码器（SAEs）解耦大推理模型（LRMs）中纠缠的隐藏状态，识别并控制细粒度推理策略，显著提升控制效果与任务准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大推理模型（LRMs）自主选择推理策略常导致低效或错误路径，亟需可靠、灵活的推理策略控制方法；但因隐藏状态中策略概念纠缠，现有方法难以实现细粒度控制。

Method: 提出SAE-Steering两阶段特征识别流程：首先用策略关键词logits放大召回相关稀疏特征（过滤超99%无关特征），再按控制有效性排序剩余特征；以识别出的策略特异性特征作为控制向量。

Result: SAE-Steering在控制有效性上超越现有方法15%以上，并能将LRMs从错误推理路径重定向至正确路径，带来7%绝对准确率提升。

Conclusion: 基于SAEs的特征解耦与SAE-Steering特征识别框架，可高效、精准地控制LRMs的细粒度推理策略，显著增强其推理可靠性与灵活性。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) exhibit human-like cognitive reasoning strategies (e.g. backtracking, cross-verification) during reasoning process, which improves their performance on complex tasks. Currently, reasoning strategies are autonomously selected by LRMs themselves. However, such autonomous selection often produces inefficient or even erroneous reasoning paths. To make reasoning more reliable and flexible, it is important to develop methods for controlling reasoning strategies. Existing methods struggle to control fine-grained reasoning strategies due to conceptual entanglement in LRMs' hidden states. To address this, we leverage Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose strategy-entangled hidden states into a disentangled feature space. To identify the few strategy-specific features from the vast pool of SAE features, we propose SAE-Steering, an efficient two-stage feature identification pipeline. SAE-Steering first recalls features that amplify the logits of strategy-specific keywords, filtering out over 99\% of features, and then ranks the remaining features by their control effectiveness. Using the identified strategy-specific features as control vectors, SAE-Steering outperforms existing methods by over 15\% in control effectiveness. Furthermore, controlling reasoning strategies can redirect LRMs from erroneous paths to correct ones, achieving a 7\% absolute accuracy improvement.

Motivation: 蛋白质功能预测是一个知识密集型的科学任务，依赖外部生物学先验和计算工具，而非纯粹的内部推理。

Method: 提出PFUA，一种工具增强的蛋白质推理代理，统一问题分解、工具调用和基于证据的答案生成。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，PFUA持续优于纯文本推理模型，平均性能提升103%。

Conclusion: 直接将基于文本的思维链推理范式迁移到蛋白质功能理解是无效的，而结合领域工具的推理方法能显著提升性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted the effectiveness of chain-of-thought reasoning in symbolic domains such as mathematics and programming. However, our study shows that directly transferring such text-based reasoning paradigms to protein function understanding is ineffective: reinforcement learning mainly amplifies superficial keyword patterns while failing to introduce new biological knowledge, resulting in limited generalization. We argue that protein function prediction is a knowledge-intensive scientific task that fundamentally relies on external biological priors and computational tools rather than purely internal reasoning. To address this gap, we propose PFUA, a tool-augmented protein reasoning agent that unifies problem decomposition, tool invocation, and grounded answer generation. Instead of relying on long unconstrained reasoning traces, PFUA integrates domain-specific tools to produce verifiable intermediate evidence. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that PFUA consistently outperforms text-only reasoning models with an average performance improvement of 103%.

Conclusion: 该框架为动态多智能体生态系统提供了兼具实践指导性与形式化严谨性的架构范式，有助于推动Agentic AI在企业与工业场景中安全、可信、合规地落地应用。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLM) and subsequent Agentic AI technologies requires systematic architectural guidance for building sophisticated, production-grade systems. This paper presents an approach for architecting such systems using design patterns derived from enterprise distributed systems standards, formal methods, and industry practice. We classify these patterns into three tiers: LLM Agents (task-specific automation), Agentic AI (adaptive goal-seekers), and Agentic Communities (organizational frameworks where AI agents and human participants coordinate through formal roles, protocols, and governance structures). We focus on Agentic Communities - coordination frameworks encompassing LLM Agents, Agentic AI entities, and humans - most relevant for enterprise and industrial applications. Drawing on established coordination principles from distributed systems, we ground these patterns in a formal framework that specifies collaboration agreements where AI agents and humans fill roles within governed ecosystems. This approach provides both practical guidance and formal verification capabilities, enabling expression of organizational, legal, and ethical rules through accountability mechanisms that ensure operational and verifiable governance of inter-agent communication, negotiation, and intent modeling. We validate this framework through a clinical trial matching case study. Our goal is to provide actionable guidance to practitioners while maintaining the formal rigor essential for enterprise deployment in dynamic, multi-agent ecosystems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出SafeRemind方法，通过在推理步骤中动态注入安全提醒短语，在解码时提升大推理模型（LRMs）的安全性，无需参数更新，显著提高安全性并保持推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）虽通过显式推理步骤取得成功，但其推理过程可能放大不安全行为；而传统防御机制因忽视LRMs独特的推理动态而失效。作者发现推理步骤中出现‘安全提醒短语’对保障模型安全起关键作用。

Method: 提出解码时防御方法SafeRemind：利用熵触发机制识别决策锁定点，并在推理步骤中动态注入安全提醒短语，从而将潜在有害推理路径重定向至更安全结果，无需任何参数更新。

Result: 在5个LRMs和6个基准测试上的广泛评估表明，SafeRemind显著提升安全性，最高提升达45.5个百分点，同时保持核心推理能力。

Conclusion: SafeRemind是一种高效、轻量、即插即用的解码时安全增强方法，为LRMs的安全部署提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve remarkable success through explicit thinking steps, yet the thinking steps introduce a novel risk by potentially amplifying unsafe behaviors. Despite this vulnerability, conventional defense mechanisms remain ineffective as they overlook the unique reasoning dynamics of LRMs. In this work, we find that the emergence of safe-reminding phrases within thinking steps plays a pivotal role in ensuring LRM safety. Motivated by this finding, we propose SafeRemind, a decoding-time defense method that dynamically injects safe-reminding phrases into thinking steps. By leveraging entropy triggers to intervene at decision-locking points, SafeRemind redirects potentially harmful trajectories toward safer outcomes without requiring any parameter updates. Extensive evaluations across five LRMs and six benchmarks demonstrate that SafeRemind substantially enhances safety, achieving improvements of up to 45.5%p while preserving core reasoning utility.

*Chen Zhang,Kepu Zhang,Jiatong Zhang,Xiao Zhang,Jun Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出Sandwich Reasoning（SandwichR）方法，通过Answer-Reasoning-Answer范式与一致性感知强化学习，在保证链式推理（CoT）精度的同时显著降低查询纠错延迟，实现低延迟高精度的实时搜索查询纠错。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有链式思维（CoT）推理虽能提升查询纠错准确率，但延迟过高，难以满足实时搜索的严苛时延要求；而提前输出答案又导致其无法利用后续推理提升准确性，亟需兼顾低延迟与推理增强准确性的新方法。

Method: 提出SandwichR框架，采用Answer-Reasoning-Answer三阶段范式；设计一致性感知强化学习策略，包括一致性奖励（约束初答与终答对齐）和基于间隔的拒绝采样（聚焦推理增益显著的边界样本）；并构建高质量专用查询纠错数据集。

Result: 在保持与标准CoT相当SOTA准确率的同时，实现40–70%的延迟降低，显著缓解在线搜索中延迟与精度的权衡问题。

Conclusion: SandwichR成功解耦了低延迟响应与推理驱动的精度提升，为实时搜索场景下的推理增强型查询纠错提供了有效可行的新范式。

Abstract: Query correction is a critical entry point in modern search pipelines, demanding high accuracy strictly within real-time latency constraints. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves accuracy but incurs prohibitive latency for real-time query correction. A potential solution is to output an answer before reasoning to reduce latency; however, under autoregressive decoding, the early answer is independent of subsequent reasoning, preventing the model from leveraging its reasoning capability to improve accuracy. To address this issue, we propose Sandwich Reasoning (SandwichR), a novel approach that explicitly aligns a fast initial answer with post-hoc reasoning, enabling low-latency query correction without sacrificing reasoning-aware accuracy. SandwichR follows an Answer-Reasoning-Answer paradigm, producing an initial correction, an explicit reasoning process, and a final refined correction. To align the initial answer with post-reasoning insights, we design a consistency-aware reinforcement learning (RL) strategy: a dedicated consistency reward enforces alignment between the initial and final corrections, while margin-based rejection sampling prioritizes borderline samples where reasoning drives the most impactful corrective gains. Additionally, we construct a high-quality query correction dataset, addressing the lack of specialized benchmarks for complex query correction. Experimental results demonstrate that SandwichR achieves SOTA accuracy comparable to standard CoT while delivering a 40-70% latency reduction, resolving the latency-accuracy trade-off in online search.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合程序化领域建模与大语言模型（LLM）生成问题特定启发式的方法，显著提升了个性化用药规划的可扩展性，将支持药物数量从最多7种提升至至少28种。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前基于通用领域无关启发式的自动规划方法在用药规划中受限于仅能处理最多7种药物，无法满足临床实际需求，亟需提升可扩展性。

Method: 采用程序化方式定义用药规划领域（包括初始状态和后继状态生成过程），并利用大语言模型（LLM）为具体问题生成定制化启发式函数，嵌入到贪心最佳优先搜索（GBFS）框架中。

Result: 规划覆盖率和求解时间显著改善，支持药物数量提升至至少28种，大幅增强临床实用性。

Conclusion: 自动生成的问题特定启发式可有效突破传统通用启发式在复杂医疗规划任务中的规模瓶颈，是迈向临床落地的关键一步。

Abstract: Personalized medication planning involves selecting medications and determining a dosing schedule to achieve medical goals specific to each individual patient. Previous work successfully demonstrated that automated planners, using general domain-independent heuristics, are able to generate personalized treatments, when the domain and problems are modeled using a general domain description language (\pddlp). Unfortunately, this process was limited in practice to consider no more than seven medications. In clinical terms, this is a non-starter. In this paper, we explore the use of automatically-generated domain- and problem-specific heuristics to be used with general search, as a method of scaling up medication planning to levels allowing closer work with clinicians. Specifically, we specify the domain programmatically (specifying an initial state and a successor generation procedure), and use an LLM to generate a problem specific heuristic that can be used by a fixed search algorithm (GBFS). The results indicate dramatic improvements in coverage and planning time, scaling up the number of medications to at least 28, and bringing medication planning one step closer to practical applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出EntroCoT框架，通过熵值分段与蒙特卡洛回滚评估，自动识别并修正链式推理中‘答案正确但推理错误’的问题，构建高质量推理数据集，显著提升大模型数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有微调数据集常存在“答案正确但推理错误”的问题，即最终答案正确但中间推理步骤存在幻觉、冗余或逻辑错误，影响模型学习高质量推理能力。

Method: EntroCoT提出熵值驱动的推理步骤分割机制，并结合蒙特卡洛回滚评估各步骤的边际贡献，从而精准识别和过滤低质量推理样本。

Result: 在多个数学基准测试上，基于EntroCoT构建的子集进行微调，性能持续优于全量数据集监督的基线方法。

Conclusion: EntroCoT能有效提升链式推理监督数据的质量，为大语言模型数学推理能力的增强提供可靠的数据基础。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly enhanced the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models. We find existing fine-tuning datasets frequently suffer from the "answer right but reasoning wrong" probelm, where correct final answers are derived from hallucinated, redundant, or logically invalid intermediate steps. This paper proposes EntroCoT, a unified framework for automatically identifying and refining low-quality CoT supervision traces. EntroCoT first proposes an entropy-based mechanism to segment the reasoning trace into multiple steps at uncertain junctures, and then introduces a Monte Carlo rollout-based mechanism to evaluate the marginal contribution of each step. By accurately filtering deceptive reasoning samples, EntroCoT constructs a high-quality dataset where every intermediate step in each reasoning trace facilitates the final answer. Extensive experiments on mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that fine-tuning on the subset constructed by EntroCoT consistently outperforms the baseslines of full-dataset supervision.

*Muyang Zhao,Qi Qi,Hao Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出ROI-Reasoning框架，通过元认知微调与理性感知强化学习，使大语言模型能在严格全局token预算下自主进行推理成本与收益预估，并优化计算资源分配，显著提升预算受限下的数学推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽具强推理能力，但缺乏对任务所需计算量的内在判断能力，难以在严格全局token约束下高效分配推理资源。

Method: 提出ROI-Reasoning两阶段框架：第一阶段为元认知微调（Meta-Cognitive Fine-Tuning），使模型能预测推理成本与预期效用，支持显式‘求解或跳过’决策；第二阶段为理性感知强化学习（Rationality-Aware RL），在硬性token预算下优化长程计算分配策略。问题被形式化为有序随机多选背包问题（OS-MCKP）。

Result: 在多个预算受限的数学推理基准上，ROI-Reasoning在整体得分上持续提升，并在严苛计算预算下显著降低遗憾值（regret）。

Conclusion: 赋予LLM内在的、预算感知的理性能力是实现高效推理的关键；ROI-Reasoning为预算化推理提供了可扩展、可学习的元认知与决策协同范式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can achieve strong reasoning performance with sufficient computation, but they do not inherently know how much computation a task requires. We study budgeted inference-time reasoning for multiple tasks under a strict global token constraint and formalize it as a Ordered Stochastic Multiple-Choice Knapsack Problem(OS-MCKP). This perspective highlights a meta-cognitive requirement -- anticipating task difficulty, estimating return over investment (ROI), and allocating computation strategically. We propose ROI-Reasoning, a two-stage framework that endows LLMs with intrinsic, budget-aware rationality. In the first stage, Meta-Cognitive Fine-Tuning teaches models to predict reasoning cost and expected utility before generation, enabling explicit solve-or-skip decisions. Next, Rationality-Aware Reinforcement Learning optimizes sequential decision making under a hard token budget, allowing models to learn long-horizon allocation strategies. Across budgeted mathematical reasoning benchmarks, ROI-Reasoning consistently improves overall score while substantially reducing regret under tight computation budgets.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Answer Set Programming（ASP）的声明式方法来计算KLM框架下的Rational Closure（RC），并证明其正确性，实验表明该方法在保持理论正确性的同时具有更高的计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Rational Closure（RC）算法多为命令式实现，缺乏声明式、可验证的建模方式；需要一种能自动构建最小秩模型并支持可证明正确性的新方法。

Method: 采用Answer Set Programming（ASP）对Rational Closure进行声明式编码，实现从知识库自动构造最小秩模型，并支持查询的可满足性检查；通过形式化证明确保编码与RC语义一致。

Result: 所提ASP编码被形式化证明是正确的；实证评估显示其在运行效率上优于现有的InfOCF等命令式求解器。

Conclusion: ASP是一种适合建模和计算Rational Closure的有力工具，兼具声明性、可验证性与实际高效性，为 defeasible reasoning 提供了新的实现范式。

Abstract: Defeasible entailment is concerned with drawing plausible conclusions from incomplete information. A foundational framework for modelling defeasible entailment is the KLM framework. Introduced by Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor, the KLM framework outlines several key properties for defeasible entailment. One of the most prominent algorithms within this framework is Rational Closure (RC). This paper presents a declarative definition for computing RC using Answer Set Programming (ASP). Our approach enables the automatic construction of the minimal ranked model from a given knowledge base and supports entailment checking for specified queries. We formally prove the correctness of our ASP encoding and conduct empirical evaluations to compare the performance of our implementation with that of existing imperative implementations, specifically the InfOCF solver. The results demonstrate that our ASP-based approach adheres to RC's theoretical foundations and offers improved computational efficiency.

Motivation: 为支持法律专家在刑事审判阶段进行有效推理和预测可能的法律结果，需将复杂的法律条文形式化并实现可解释的自动化推理。

Method: 使用Answer Set Programming（ASP）对意大利刑法典相关条文（如侵害人身罪、财产犯罪）进行建模与编码；结合稳定模型的‘支持性’特性提供解释能力；集成ASP上的归纳逻辑编程（ILP）系统，从判例中泛化法律规则；通过实际判决数据验证与迭代优化模型。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了法律条文的形式化建模与可解释AI驱动的法律推理，提升了司法决策的透明度与可追溯性，验证了ASP及其扩展技术在法律智能系统中的可行性与实用性。

Abstract: We propose an approach to model articles of the Italian Criminal Code (ICC), using Answer Set Programming (ASP), and to semi-automatically learn legal rules from examples based on prior judicial decisions. The developed tool is intended to support legal experts during the criminal trial phase by providing reasoning and possible legal outcomes. The methodology involves analyzing and encoding articles of the ICC in ASP, including "crimes against the person" and property offenses. The resulting model is validated on a set of previous verdicts and refined as necessary. During the encoding process, contradictions may arise; these are properly handled by the system, which also generates possible decisions for new cases and provides explanations through a tool that leverages the "supportedness" of stable models. The automatic explainability offered by the tool can also be used to clarify the logic behind judicial decisions, making the decision-making process more interpretable. Furthermore, the tool integrates an inductive logic programming system for ASP, which is employed to generalize legal rules from case examples.

Motivation: 决策树模型虽性能高，但在安全关键场景中因缺乏可解释性和形式化推理支持而受限；现有解释方法（如SAT）在灵活性和解释枚举能力上存在不足。

Method: 采用Answer Set Programming（ASP）建模，统一支持生成充分、对比、多数及树特异性四类逻辑解释，并利用ASP的声明式建模优势实现用户偏好编码与全部解释枚举。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该ASP方法能有效生成各类解释，在灵活性和枚举能力上优于SAT方法，但也存在计算开销大等实际局限。

Conclusion: ASP是生成多样化、形式化决策树解释的有力框架，为高可信AI系统提供了可扩展、可定制的可解释性基础。

Abstract: Decision tree models, including random forests and gradient-boosted decision trees, are widely used in machine learning due to their high predictive performance.  However, their complex structures often make them difficult to interpret, especially in safety-critical applications where model decisions require formal justification.  Recent work has demonstrated that logical and abductive explanations can be derived through automated reasoning techniques.  In this paper, we propose a method for generating various types of explanations, namely, sufficient, contrastive, majority, and tree-specific explanations, using Answer Set Programming (ASP).  Compared to SAT-based approaches, our ASP-based method offers greater flexibility in encoding user preferences and supports enumeration of all possible explanations.  We empirically evaluate the approach on a diverse set of datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness and limitations compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: xDNN(ASP)为深度神经网络提供了兼具准确性与结构性洞察的全局解释能力，弥补了传统xAI方法忽略网络架构的缺陷，同时支持模型理解与轻量化设计。

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) has gained significant attention in recent years. Among other things, explainablility for deep neural networks has been a topic of intensive research due to the meteoric rise in prominence of deep neural networks and their "black-box" nature. xAI approaches can be characterized along different dimensions such as their scope (global versus local explanations) or underlying methodologies (statistic-based versus rule-based strategies). Methods generating global explanations aim to provide reasoning process applicable to all possible output classes while local explanation methods focus only on a single, specific class. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), a well-known statistical technique, identifies important features of a network. Deep neural network rule extraction method constructs IF-THEN rules that link input conditions to a class. Another approach focuses on generating counterfactuals which help explain how small changes to an input can affect the model's predictions. However, these techniques primarily focus on the input-output relationship and thus neglect the structure of the network in explanation generation.   In this work, we propose xDNN(ASP), an explanation generation system for deep neural networks that provides global explanations. Given a neural network model and its training data, xDNN(ASP) extracts a logic program under answer set semantics that-in the ideal case-represents the trained model, i.e., answer sets of the extracted program correspond one-to-one to input-output pairs of the network. We demonstrate experimentally, using two synthetic datasets, that not only the extracted logic program maintains a high-level of accuracy in the prediction task, but it also provides valuable information for the understanding of the model such as the importance of features as well as the impact of hidden nodes on the prediction. The latter can be used as a guide for reducing the number of nodes used in hidden layers, i.e., providing a means for optimizing the network.

Abstract: Answer set programming (ASP) aims to realize the AI vision: The user specifies the problem, and the computer solves it. Indeed, ASP has made this vision true in many application domains. However, will current ASP solving techniques scale up for large configuration problems? As a benchmark for such problems, we investigated the configuration of electronic systems, which may comprise more than 30,000 components. We show the potential and limits of current ASP technology, focusing on methods that address the so-called grounding bottleneck, i.e., the sharp increase of memory demands in the size of the problem instances. To push the limits, we investigated the incremental solving approach, which proved effective in practice. However, even in the incremental approach, memory demands impose significant limits. Based on an analysis of grounding, we developed the method constraint-aware guessing, which significantly reduced the memory need.

Motivation: 当前智能体面临需预测未来状态的长视野任务，而生成式世界模型作为外部模拟器有望提升其预见能力，但尚不清楚现有智能体能否有效利用此类工具。

Method: 在多种智能体任务和视觉问答任务上进行实证评估，并结合归因分析探究智能体调用、解释和整合世界模型预测结果的行为模式与失败原因。

Result: 发现智能体极少调用模拟（<1%），常误用预测轨迹（约15%），且引入模拟后性能常不稳定甚至下降（最高达5%）；归因分析指出核心瓶颈在于‘何时模拟’、‘如何解读预测’及‘如何整合预见信息’。

Conclusion: 需设计新机制以支持智能体对世界模型进行校准化、策略化的交互，从而实现更可靠的前瞻性认知。

Abstract: Agents built on vision-language models increasingly face tasks that demand anticipating future states rather than relying on short-horizon reasoning. Generative world models offer a promising remedy: agents could use them as external simulators to foresee outcomes before acting. This paper empirically examines whether current agents can leverage such world models as tools to enhance their cognition. Across diverse agentic and visual question answering tasks, we observe that some agents rarely invoke simulation (fewer than 1%), frequently misuse predicted rollouts (approximately 15%), and often exhibit inconsistent or even degraded performance (up to 5%) when simulation is available or enforced. Attribution analysis further indicates that the primary bottleneck lies in the agents' capacity to decide when to simulate, how to interpret predicted outcomes, and how to integrate foresight into downstream reasoning. These findings underscore the need for mechanisms that foster calibrated, strategic interaction with world models, paving the way toward more reliable anticipatory cognition in future agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准强化学习在金融市场中易因回报噪声导致奖励作弊（reward hacking），需将可验证奖励有效迁移至高随机性环境。

Method: 提出Trade-R1训练框架，核心是将长金融文档推理评估建模为结构化RAG任务；构建检索证据、推理链与决策三者间的三角一致性度量作为噪声回报的过滤器；并设计固定效应语义奖励（FSR）与动态效应语义奖励（DSR）两种奖励整合策略。

Result: 在多国资产选择任务上验证，Trade-R1显著降低奖励作弊现象；DSR在跨市场泛化性和推理一致性上均表现最优。

Conclusion: 过程级推理验证与语义奖励机制可有效桥接可验证奖励与随机金融环境，为LLM在不确定性领域中的稳健决策提供新范式。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve remarkable reasoning in domains like mathematics and coding, where verifiable rewards provide clear signals. However, extending this paradigm to financial decision is challenged by the market's stochastic nature: rewards are verifiable but inherently noisy, causing standard RL to degenerate into reward hacking. To address this, we propose Trade-R1, a model training framework that bridges verifiable rewards to stochastic environments via process-level reasoning verification. Our key innovation is a verification method that transforms the problem of evaluating reasoning over lengthy financial documents into a structured Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) task. We construct a triangular consistency metric, assessing pairwise alignment between retrieved evidence, reasoning chains, and decisions to serve as a validity filter for noisy market returns. We explore two reward integration strategies: Fixed-effect Semantic Reward (FSR) for stable alignment signals, and Dynamic-effect Semantic Reward (DSR) for coupled magnitude optimization. Experiments on different country asset selection demonstrate that our paradigm reduces reward hacking, with DSR achieving superior cross-market generalization while maintaining the highest reasoning consistency.

Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的大推理模型虽性能强，但对简单查询过度 verbose，导致部署成本高；显式长度惩罚易引发优化冲突，且缺乏对‘过思考’生成机制的深入分析。

Method: 提出Dynamic Outlier Truncation（DOT）：在完全正确的rollout组内，仅截断响应长度分布尾部的极端冗余token；辅以KL正则化和预测式动态采样以保障训练稳定性。

Result: 在多尺度模型上验证有效；AIME-24上相较初始策略减少78%推理token并提升准确率，超越现有高效推理方法。

Conclusion: DOT能有效解耦简单与复杂任务的推理需求，在不损害长程推理能力前提下提升效率-性能权衡边界。

Abstract: Large reasoning models enhanced by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards have achieved significant performance gains by extending their chain-of-thought. However, this paradigm incurs substantial deployment costs as models often exhibit excessive verbosity on simple queries. Existing efficient reasoning methods relying on explicit length penalties often introduce optimization conflicts and leave the generative mechanisms driving overthinking largely unexamined. In this paper, we identify a phenomenon termed length shift where models increasingly generate unnecessary reasoning on trivial inputs during training. To address this, we introduce Dynamic Outlier Truncation (DOT), a training-time intervention that selectively suppresses redundant tokens. This method targets only the extreme tail of response lengths within fully correct rollout groups while preserving long-horizon reasoning capabilities for complex problems. To complement this intervention and ensure stable convergence, we further incorporate auxiliary KL regularization and predictive dynamic sampling. Experimental results across multiple model scales demonstrate that our approach significantly pushes the efficiency-performance Pareto frontier outward. Notably, on the AIME-24, our method reduces inference token usage by 78% while simultaneously increasing accuracy compared to the initial policy and surpassing state-of-the-art efficient reasoning methods.

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents have shown strong potential in real-world automation and practical applications. However, most existing agents remain reactive, making decisions mainly from current screen, which limits their performance on long-horizon tasks. Building a world model from repeated interactions enables forecasting action outcomes and supports better decision making for mobile GUI agents. This is challenging because the model must predict post-action states with spatial awareness while remaining efficient enough for practical deployment. In this paper, we propose MobileDreamer, an efficient world-model-based lookahead framework to equip the GUI agents based on the future imagination provided by the world model. It consists of textual sketch world model and rollout imagination for GUI agent. Textual sketch world model forecasts post-action states through a learning process to transform digital images into key task-related sketches, and designs a novel order-invariant learning strategy to preserve the spatial information of GUI elements. The rollout imagination strategy for GUI agent optimizes the action-selection process by leveraging the prediction capability of world model. Experiments on Android World show that MobileDreamer achieves state-of-the-art performance and improves task success by 5.25%. World model evaluations further verify that our textual sketch modeling accurately forecasts key GUI elements.

Abstract: AI-generated content has progressed from monolithic models to modular workflows, especially on platforms like ComfyUI, allowing users to customize complex creative pipelines. However, the large number of components in ComfyUI and the difficulty of maintaining long-horizon structural consistency under strict graph constraints frequently lead to low pass rates and workflows of limited quality. To tackle these limitations, we present ComfySearch, an agentic framework that can effectively explore the component space and generate functional ComfyUI pipelines via validation-guided workflow construction. Experiments demonstrate that ComfySearch substantially outperforms existing methods on complex and creative tasks, achieving higher executability (pass) rates, higher solution rates, and stronger generalization.

Abstract: Multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) systems have emerged as powerful architectures for complex task decomposition and collaborative problem-solving. However, their long-term behavioral stability remains largely unexamined. This study introduces the concept of agent drift, defined as the progressive degradation of agent behavior, decision quality, and inter-agent coherence over extended interaction sequences. We present a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding drift phenomena, proposing three distinct manifestations: semantic drift (progressive deviation from original intent), coordination drift (breakdown in multi-agent consensus mechanisms), and behavioral drift (emergence of unintended strategies).
  We introduce the Agent Stability Index (ASI), a novel composite metric framework for quantifying drift across twelve dimensions, including response consistency, tool usage patterns, reasoning pathway stability, and inter-agent agreement rates. Through simulation-based analysis and theoretical modeling, we demonstrate how unchecked agent drift can lead to substantial reductions in task completion accuracy and increased human intervention requirements.
  We propose three mitigation strategies: episodic memory consolidation, drift-aware routing protocols, and adaptive behavioral anchoring. Theoretical analysis suggests these approaches can significantly reduce drift-related errors while maintaining system throughput. This work establishes a foundational methodology for monitoring, measuring, and mitigating agent drift in production agentic AI systems, with direct implications for enterprise deployment reliability and AI safety research.

Abstract: A photorealistic and controllable 3D caricaturization framework for faces is introduced. We start with an intrinsic Gaussian curvature-based surface exaggeration technique, which, when coupled with texture, tends to produce over-smoothed renders. To address this, we resort to 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), which has recently been shown to produce realistic free-viewpoint avatars. Given a multiview sequence, we extract a FLAME mesh, solve a curvature-weighted Poisson equation, and obtain its exaggerated form. However, directly deforming the Gaussians yields poor results, necessitating the synthesis of pseudo-ground-truth caricature images by warping each frame to its exaggerated 2D representation using local affine transformations. We then devise a training scheme that alternates real and synthesized supervision, enabling a single Gaussian collection to represent both natural and exaggerated avatars. This scheme improves fidelity, supports local edits, and allows continuous control over the intensity of the caricature. In order to achieve real-time deformations, an efficient interpolation between the original and exaggerated surfaces is introduced. We further analyze and show that it has a bounded deviation from closed-form solutions. In both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, our results outperform prior work, delivering photorealistic, geometry-controlled caricature avatars.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种端到端的分阶段体素级深度强化学习（SVL-DRL）框架，用于在标注噪声下实现鲁棒的医学图像分割，通过动态迭代更新策略自动缓解错误标签影响，并在多个公开数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像中器官形态复杂、标注者间差异大，导致标注噪声频发，严重限制分割模型性能；而临床标注者可基于先验知识在分割过程中修正错误，该观察启发了本研究。

Conclusion: SVL-DRL能有效缓解标注噪声干扰，无需人工干预即可自动修正错误标签影响，显著提升分割鲁棒性与精度，为低质量标注下的医学图像分割提供了新范式。

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved significant advancements in medical image segmentation. Currently, obtaining accurate segmentation outcomes is critically reliant on large-scale datasets with high-quality annotations. However, noisy annotations are frequently encountered owing to the complex morphological structures of organs in medical images and variations among different annotators, which can substantially limit the efficacy of segmentation models. Motivated by the fact that medical imaging annotator can correct labeling errors during segmentation based on prior knowledge, we propose an end-to-end Staged Voxel-Level Deep Reinforcement Learning (SVL-DRL) framework for robust medical image segmentation under noisy annotations. This framework employs a dynamic iterative update strategy to automatically mitigate the impact of erroneous labels without requiring manual intervention. The key advancements of SVL-DRL over existing works include: i) formulating noisy annotations as a voxel-dependent problem and addressing it through a novel staged reinforcement learning framework which guarantees robust model convergence; ii) incorporating a voxel-level asynchronous advantage actor-critic (vA3C) module that conceptualizes each voxel as an autonomous agent, which allows each agent to dynamically refine its own state representation during training, thereby directly mitigating the influence of erroneous labels; iii) designing a novel action space for the agents, along with a composite reward function that strategically combines the Dice value and a spatial continuity metric to significantly boost segmentation accuracy while maintain semantic integrity. Experiments on three public medical image datasets demonstrates State-of-The-Art (SoTA) performance under various experimental settings, with an average improvement of over 3\% in both Dice and IoU scores.
