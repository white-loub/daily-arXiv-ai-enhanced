We introduce STARS, a transformer-based sequential recommendation framework built for large-scale, low-latency ecommerce settings. STARS combines several innovations: dual-memory user embeddings that separate long-term preferences from short-term session intent; semantic item tokens that fuse pretrained text embeddings, learnable deltas, and LLM-derived attribute tags, strengthening content-based matching, long-tail coverage, and cold-start performance; context-aware scoring with learned calendar and event offsets; and a latency-conscious two-stage retrieval pipeline that performs offline embedding generation and online maximum inner-product search with filtering, enabling tens-of-milliseconds response times. In offline evaluations on production-scale data, STARS improves Hit@5 by more than 75 percent relative to our existing LambdaMART system. A large-scale A/B test on 6 million visits shows statistically significant lifts, including Total Orders +0.8%, Add-to-Cart on Home +2.0%, and Visits per User +0.5%.

These HID embeddings effectively learn collaborative information from historical user-item interactions, making them vulnerable to situations where most items are rarely consumed (the long-tail problem). Recent methods that incorporate auxiliary information often suffer from noisy collaborative sharing caused by co-occurrence signals or semantic homogeneity caused by flat dense embeddings. Semantic IDs (SIDs), with their capability of code sharing and multi-granular semantic modeling, provide a promising alternative. However, the collaborative overwhelming phenomenon hinders the further development of SID-based methods. The quantization mechanisms commonly compromise the uniqueness of identifiers required for modeling head items, creating a performance seesaw between head and tail items. To address this dilemma, we propose \\textbf{\\name}, a novel framework that harmonizes the SID and HID. Specifically, we devise a dual-branch modeling architecture that enables the model to capture both the multi-granular semantics within SID while preserving the unique collaborative identity of HID. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-level alignment strategy that bridges the two representations, facilitating knowledge transfer and supporting robust preference modeling. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that \\name~ effectively balances recommendation quality for both head and tail items while surpassing the existing baselines.

While existing approaches treat this as an external confounding factor, we reveal that popularity bias is an intrinsic geometric artifact of Bayesian Pairwise Ranking (BPR) optimization in CF models. Through rigorous mathematical analysis, we prove that BPR systematically organizes item embeddings along a dominant \"popularity direction\" where embedding magnitudes directly correlate with interaction frequency. This geometric distortion forces user embeddings to simultaneously handle two conflicting tasks-expressing genuine preference and calibrating against global popularity-trapping them in suboptimal configurations that favor popular items regardless of individual tastes. We propose Directional Decomposition and Correction (DDC), a universally applicable framework that surgically corrects this embedding geometry through asymmetric directional updates. DDC guides positive interactions along personalized preference directions while steering negative interactions away from the global popularity direction, disentangling preference from popularity at the geometric source. Extensive experiments across multiple BPR-based architectures demonstrate that DDC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art debiasing methods, reducing training loss to less than 5% of heavily-tuned baselines while achieving superior recommendation quality and fairness.

We introduce NeHaD, a neural deformation field for dynamic Gaussian Splatting governed by Hamiltonian mechanics. Our key observation is that existing methods using MLPs to predict deformation fields introduce inevitable biases, resulting in unnatural dynamics. By incorporating physics priors, we achieve robust and realistic dynamic scene rendering. Hamiltonian mechanics provides an ideal framework for modeling Gaussian deformation fields due to their shared phase-space structure, where primitives evolve along energy-conserving trajectories. We employ Hamiltonian neural networks to implicitly learn underlying physical laws governing deformation. Meanwhile, we introduce Boltzmann equilibrium decomposition, an energy-aware mechanism that adaptively separates static and dynamic Gaussians based on their spatial-temporal energy states for flexible rendering. To handle real-world dissipation, we employ second-order symplectic integration and local rigidity regularization as physics-informed constraints for robust dynamics modeling. Additionally, we extend NeHaD to adaptive streaming through scale-aware mipmapping and progressive optimization.

Deterministic workflow automation cannot meet these requirements, as it lacks the epistemic flexibility, cooperative coordination mechanisms, and norm-sensitive behaviour required for institutional risk-transfer.\n  We propose the Reinsurance Constrained Multi-Agent Simulation Process (R-CMASP), a formal model that extends stochastic games and Dec-POMDPs by adding three missing elements: (i) simulator-coupled transition dynamics grounded in catastrophe, capital, and portfolio engines; (ii) role-specialized agents with structured observability, belief updates, and typed communication; and (iii) a normative feasibility layer encoding solvency, regulatory, and organizational rules as admissibility constraints on joint actions.\n  Using LLM-based agents with tool access and typed message protocols, we show in a domain-calibrated synthetic environment that governed multi-agent coordination yields more stable, coherent, and norm-adherent behaviour than deterministic automation or monolithic LLM baselines--reducing pricing variance, improving capital efficiency, and increasing clause-interpretation accuracy. Embedding prudential norms as admissibility constraints and structuring communication into typed acts measurably enhances equilibrium stability.\n  Overall, the results suggest that regulated, simulator-driven decision environments are most naturally modelled as norm-governed, simulator-coupled multi-agent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u518d\u4fdd\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u578b\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4eff\u771f\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08R-CMASP\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8026\u5408\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u3001\u89d2\u8272\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e0e\u89c4\u8303\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u5c42\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u98ce\u9669\u8f6c\u79fb\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u518d\u4fdd\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\u5177\u6709\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4e0e\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u3001\u5f02\u6784\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d23\u4efb\u3001\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u9a71\u52a8\u52a8\u6001\u53ca\u4e25\u683c\u5ba1\u614e\u76d1\u7ba1\u7ea6\u675f\u7b49\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5176\u8ba4\u77e5\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3001\u534f\u4f5c\u534f\u8c03\u4e0e\u89c4\u8303\u654f\u611f\u884c\u4e3a\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faR-CMASP\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u968f\u673a\u535a\u5f08\u4e0eDec-POMDP\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e09\u8981\u7d20\uff1a(i)\u8026\u5408\u707e\u5bb3/\u8d44\u672c/\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u5f15\u64ce\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u9a71\u52a8\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\uff1b(ii)\u5177\u5907\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89c2\u5bdf\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u4fe1\u5ff5\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0e\u7c7b\u578b\u5316\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u4e13\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff1b(iii)\u5c06\u507f\u4ed8\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u76d1\u7ba1\u4e0e\u7ec4\u7ec7\u89c4\u5219\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u8054\u5408\u884c\u52a8\u53ef\u5bb9\u8bb8\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u5c42\uff1b\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u5177\u5907\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u7c7b\u578b\u5316\u6d88\u606f\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9886\u57df\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u5408\u6210\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d7\u89c4\u8303\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u540c\u76f8\u6bd4\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6216\u5355\u4f53\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5b9a\u4ef7\u65b9\u5dee\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8d44\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6761\u6b3e\u89e3\u91ca\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5747\u8861\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53d7\u76d1\u7ba1\u3001\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u73af\u5883\u6700\u81ea\u7136\u5730\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u89c4\u8303\u6cbb\u7406\u3001\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u8026\u5408\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

However, their scalability to large-scale graphs remains challenging due to structural redundancy and high-dimensional node features. Existing graph condensation approaches, such as GCond, are primarily developed for homogeneous graphs and rely on gradient matching, resulting in considerable computational, memory, and optimization overhead. We propose HGC-Herd, a training-free condensation framework that generates compact yet informative heterogeneous graphs while maintaining both semantic and structural fidelity. HGC-Herd integrates lightweight feature propagation to encode multi-hop relational context and employs a class-wise herding mechanism to identify representative nodes per class, producing balanced and discriminative subsets for downstream learning tasks. Extensive experiments on ACM, DBLP, and Freebase validate that HGC-Herd attains comparable or superior accuracy to full-graph training while markedly reducing both runtime and memory consumption. These results underscore its practical value for efficient and scalable heterogeneous graph representation learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86HGC-Herd\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u56fe\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u7c7b\u7ea7\u522bherding\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u4e14\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u56fe\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u5168\u56fe\u8bad\u7ec3\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f02\u8d28\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08HGNNs\uff09\u9762\u4e34\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u800c\u4e3b\u6d41\u56fe\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982GCond\uff09\u4e3b\u8981\u9762\u5411\u540c\u8d28\u56fe\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u68af\u5ea6\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5e26\u6765\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHGC-Herd\uff1a\u7ed3\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u591a\u8df3\u7279\u5f81\u4f20\u64ad\u4ee5\u7f16\u7801\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u7c7b\u7ea7\u522bherding\u673a\u5236\u9009\u53d6\u6bcf\u7c7b\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u8861\u4e14\u5224\u522b\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u5b50\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u5728ACM\u3001DBLP\u548cFreebase\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHGC-Herd\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5ab2\u7f8e\u6216\u4f18\u4e8e\u5168\u56fe\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "conclusion": "HGC-Herd\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

On the Stochastic Nature and Abductive Appearance of Large Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "This article looks at how reasoning works in current Large Language Models (LLMs) that function using the token-completion method. It examines their stochastic nature and their similarity to human abductive reasoning. The argument is that these LLMs create text based on learned patterns rather than performing actual abductive reasoning. When their output seems abductive, this is largely because they are trained on human-generated texts that include reasoning structures. Examples are used to show how LLMs can produce plausible ideas, mimic commonsense reasoning, and give explanatory answers without being grounded in truth, semantics, verification, or understanding, and without performing any real abductive reasoning. This dual nature, where the models have a stochastic base but appear abductive in use, has important consequences for how LLMs are evaluated and applied. They can assist with generating ideas and supporting human thinking, but their outputs must be critically assessed because they cannot identify truth or verify their explanations. The article concludes by addressing five objections to these points, noting some limitations in the analysis, and offering an overall evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8etoken-completion\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5176\u8f93\u51fa\u867d\u770b\u4f3c\u5177\u6709\u6eaf\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\uff08abductive reasoning\uff09\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5b9e\u5219\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5e76\u65e0\u771f\u5b9e\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u57fa\u7840\u6216\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u5176\u7c7b\u6eaf\u56e0\u8868\u73b0\u6e90\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u4eba\u7c7b\u6587\u672c\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u4eff\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9700\u8c28\u614e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6f84\u6e05\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u5177\u5907\u6eaf\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u8868\u9762\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u4e0e\u5185\u5728\u968f\u673a\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4ee5\u6b63\u786e\u8ba4\u8bc6\u5176\u80fd\u529b\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u6982\u5ff5\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u6279\u5224\u6027\u8bba\u8bc1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u4f8b\u8bf4\u660eLLMs\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u672c\u8d28\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6eaf\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6839\u672c\u533a\u522b\uff0c\u5e76\u56de\u5e94\u4e94\u7c7b\u5178\u578b\u53cd\u5bf9\u610f\u89c1\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u5b9eLLMs\u4e0d\u5177\u5907\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u6eaf\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u2014\u2014\u5176\u8f93\u51fa\u662f\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u590d\u73b0\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u503c\u5224\u65ad\u3001\u8bed\u4e49 grounding\u3001\u903b\u8f91\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u57fa\u7840\uff1b\u5176\u2018\u7c7b\u6eaf\u56e0\u2019\u8868\u73b0\u4ec5\u4e3a\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u6587\u672c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8868\u5c42\u6a21\u4eff\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u521b\u610f\u8f85\u52a9\u4e0e\u601d\u7ef4\u652f\u6301\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u80fd\u66ff\u4ee3\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b\u5bf9\u5176\u8f93\u51fa\u5fc5\u987b\u4fdd\u6301\u6279\u5224\u6027\u5ba1\u89c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u5e94\u533a\u5206\u8868\u9762\u5408\u7406\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8d28\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

We've developed ExaCraft, an AI system that generates personalized examples by adapting to the learner's dynamic context. Through the Google Gemini AI and Python Flask API, accessible via a Chrome extension, ExaCraft combines user-defined profiles (including location, education, profession, and complexity preferences) with real-time analysis of learner behavior. This ensures examples are both culturally relevant and tailored to individual learning needs. The system's core innovation is its ability to adapt to five key aspects of the learning context: indicators of struggle, mastery patterns, topic progression history, session boundaries, and learning progression signals.

Such capabilities are vital for enabling seamless and responsive interaction in emerging technologies like augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), where understanding user gaze is key to immersion and interface design. Neuromorphic sensors and spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising alternative, yet existing SNN approaches are either too specialized or fall short of the performance of modern ANN architectures. This paper presents a neuromorphic version of top-performing event-based eye-tracking models, replacing their recurrent and attention modules with lightweight LIF layers and exploiting depth-wise separable convolutions to reduce model complexity. Our models obtain 3.7-4.1px mean error, approaching the accuracy of the application-specific neuromorphic system, Retina (3.24px), while reducing model size by 20x and theoretical compute by 850x, compared to the closest ANN variant of the proposed model. These efficient variants are projected to operate at an estimated 3.9-4.9 mW with 3 ms latency at 1 kHz.

In this work, we propose HeRD, a hierarchical reinforcement learning-diffusion policy that decomposes pushing tasks into two levels: high-level goal selection and low-level trajectory generation. We employ a high-level reinforcement learning (RL) agent to select intermediate spatial goals, and a low-level goal-conditioned diffusion model to generate feasible, efficient trajectories to reach them.\n  This architecture combines the long-term reward maximizing behaviour of RL with the generative capabilities of diffusion models. We evaluate our method in a 2D simulation environment and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline in success rate, path efficiency, and generalization across multiple environment configurations.

Coarse-grained, model-level methods yield only a sparse set of suboptimal solutions, while fine-grained, layer-wise approaches suffer from the \"curse of dimensionality,\" rendering the search space computationally intractable. To resolve this dichotomy, we propose BAMBO (Bayesian Adaptive Multi-objective Block-wise Optimization), a novel framework that automatically constructs the LLM Pareto set. BAMBO renders the search tractable by introducing a Hybrid Optimal Block Partitioning strategy. Formulated as a 1D clustering problem, this strategy leverages a dynamic programming approach to optimally balance intra-block homogeneity and inter-block information distribution, thereby dramatically reducing dimensionality without sacrificing critical granularity.

Please visit our project page at https://kaist-viclab.github.io/ABBSPO_site/", "summary": "Weakly supervised oriented object detection (WS-OOD) has gained attention as a cost-effective alternative to fully supervised methods, providing both efficiency and high accuracy. Among weakly supervised approaches, horizontal bounding box (HBox)-supervised OOD stands out for its ability to directly leverage existing HBox annotations while achieving the highest accuracy under weak supervision settings. This paper introduces adaptive bounding box scaling and symmetry-prior-based orientation prediction, called ABBSPO, a framework for WS-OOD. Our ABBSPO addresses limitations of previous HBox-supervised OOD methods, which compare ground truth (GT) HBoxes directly with the minimum circumscribed rectangles of predicted RBoxes, often leading to inaccurate scale estimation. To overcome this, we propose: (i) Adaptive Bounding Box Scaling (ABBS), which appropriately scales GT HBoxes to optimize for the size of each predicted RBox, ensuring more accurate scale prediction; and (ii) a Symmetric Prior Angle (SPA) loss that exploits inherent symmetry of aerial objects for self-supervised learning, resolving issues in previous methods where learning collapses when predictions for all three augmented views (original, rotated, and flipped) are consistently incorrect.

We investigate a fundamental question: what aspect of the target representation matters for generation, its \\textit{global} \\revision{semantic} information (e.g., measured by ImageNet-1K accuracy) or its spatial structure (i.e. pairwise cosine similarity between patch tokens)? Prevalent wisdom holds that stronger global semantic performance leads to better generation as a target representation. To study this, we first perform a large-scale empirical analysis across 27 different vision encoders and different model scales. The results are surprising; spatial structure, rather than global performance, drives the generation performance of a target representation. To further study this, we introduce two straightforward modifications, which specifically accentuate the transfer of \\emph{spatial} information. We replace the standard MLP projection layer in REPA with a simple convolution layer and introduce a spatial normalization layer for the external representation. Surprisingly, our simple method (implemented in $<$4 lines of code), termed iREPA, consistently improves convergence speed of REPA, across a diverse set of vision encoders, model sizes, and training variants (such as REPA, REPA-E, Meanflow, JiT etc). %, etc. Our work motivates revisiting the fundamental working mechanism of representational alignment and how it can be leveraged for improved training of generative models.

Exploiting this redundancy is crucial for achieving the desired workspace and dexterity required for the feasibility and optimisation of toolpath planning. Inverse kinematics algorithms can solve this in a fast, reactive framework, but these techniques are underutilised over the more computationally expensive offline planning methods. We propose a novel algorithm to solve functionally redundant inverse kinematics for robotic manipulation utilising a task space decomposition approach, the damped least-squares method and Halley's method to achieve fast and robust solutions with reduced joint motion. We evaluate our methodology in the case of toolpath optimisation in a cold spray coating application on a non-planar surface. The functionally redundant inverse kinematics algorithm can quickly solve motion plans that minimise joint motion, expanding the feasible operating space of the complex toolpath. We validate our approach on an industrial ABB manipulator and cold-spray gun executing the computed toolpath.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u89e3\u3001\u963b\u5c3c\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u6cd5\u548cHalley\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u516d\u8f74\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u529f\u80fd\u5197\u4f59\u9006\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u7684\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u5173\u8282\u8fd0\u52a8\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u51b7\u55b7\u6d82\u6d82\u5c42\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u516d\u8f74\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u5728\u710a\u63a5\u548c\u589e\u6750\u5236\u9020\u7b49\u5de5\u4e1a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u56e0\u5de5\u5177\u8f74\u5bf9\u79f0\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u5197\u4f59\uff08\u5b9e\u4e3a\u4e94\u8f74\u4efb\u52a1\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8be5\u5197\u4f59\u5bf9\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u5200\u5177\u8def\u5f84\u4f18\u5316\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u5feb\u901f\u9006\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u89e3\u3001\u963b\u5c3c\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u6cd5\u548cHalley\u6cd5\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u529f\u80fd\u5197\u4f59\u9006\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u6c42\u89e3\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6c42\u89e3\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u5173\u8282\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u51b7\u55b7\u6d82\u975e\u5e73\u9762\u8868\u9762\u6d82\u5c42\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u4f4e\u5173\u8282\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u5200\u5177\u8def\u5f84\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u8def\u5f84\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u64cd\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u5728ABB\u5de5\u4e1a\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u4e0e\u51b7\u55b7\u6d82\u67aa\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u6210\u529f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3a\u529f\u80fd\u5197\u4f59\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u9006\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u5728\u7ebf\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u3002"}}

Our agents maintain internal memory states while depositing persistent environmental traces, creating a spatially distributed collective memory without centralized control. Comprehensive validation across five environmental conditions (20x20 to 50x50 grids, 5-20 agents, 50 runs per configuration) reveals a critical asymmetry: individual memory alone provides 68.7% performance improvement over no-memory baselines (1563.87 vs 927.23, p < 0.001), while environmental traces without memory fail completely. This demonstrates that memory functions independently but traces require cognitive infrastructure for interpretation. Systematic density-sweep experiments (rho in [0.049, 0.300], up to 625 agents) validate our theoretical phase transition prediction. On realistic large grids (30x30, 50x50), stigmergic coordination dominates above rho ~ 0.20, with traces outperforming memory by 36-41% on composite metrics despite lower food efficiency.

Standard world models typically rely on action-conditioned trajectories, which limits effectiveness when action labels are scarce. We introduce a family of latent-action world models that jointly use action-conditioned and action-free data by learning a shared latent action representation. This latent space aligns observed control signals with actions inferred from passive observations, enabling a single dynamics model to train on large-scale unlabeled trajectories while requiring only a small set of action-labeled ones. We use the latent-action world model to learn a latent-action policy through offline reinforcement learning (RL), thereby bridging two traditionally separate domains: offline RL, which typically relies on action-conditioned data, and action-free training, which is rarely used with subsequent RL. On the DeepMind Control Suite, our approach achieves strong performance while using about an order of magnitude fewer action-labeled samples than purely action-conditioned baselines. These results show that latent actions enable training on both passive and interactive data, which makes world models learn more efficiently.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd latent-action world model\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u5229\u7528\u5e26\u52a8\u4f5c\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u65e0\u52a8\u4f5c\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u6807\u7b7e\u7a00\u7f3a\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u52a8\u4f5c\u6807\u6ce8\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u6807\u7b7e\u7a00\u7f3a\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u9650\uff1b\u800c\u4eba\u7c7b\u80fd\u7ed3\u5408\u76f4\u63a5\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0e\u65e0\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff08\u5982\u89c6\u9891\uff09\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u6784\u5efa\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa latent-action world model\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c06\u771f\u5b9e\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e0e\u88ab\u52a8\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u63a8\u65ad\u52a8\u4f5c\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4f7f\u5355\u4e00\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u5c11\u91cf\u52a8\u4f5c\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u8fdb\u884c\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60 latent-action \u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728 DeepMind Control Suite \u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u9700\u7ea6\u5341\u5206\u4e4b\u4e00\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u6807\u6ce8\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u7eaf\u52a8\u4f5c\u6807\u6ce8\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "latent action \u8868\u5f81\u6709\u6548\u6865\u63a5\u4e86\u52a8\u4f5c\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u65e0\u52a8\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e5f\u6253\u901a\u4e86\u79bb\u7ebf RL \u4e0e\u65e0\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u754c\u9650\u3002"}}

This study establishes that this bottleneck arises from existing generative paradigms succumbing to the Statistical Smoothing Trap, a phenomenon that overlooks the high-entropy information acquisition and structured cognitive processes integral to expert-level writing. To address this limitation, we propose the DeepNews Framework, an agentic workflow that explicitly models the implicit cognitive processes of seasoned financial journalists. The framework integrates three core modules: first, a dual-granularity retrieval mechanism grounded in information foraging theory, which enforces a 10:1 saturated information input ratio to mitigate hallucinatory outputs; second, schema-guided strategic planning, a process leveraging domain expert knowledge bases (narrative schemas) and Atomic Blocks to forge a robust logical skeleton; third, adversarial constraint prompting, a technique deploying tactics including Rhythm Break and Logic Fog to disrupt the probabilistic smoothness inherent in model-generated text. Experiments delineate a salient Knowledge Cliff in deep financial reporting: content truthfulness collapses when retrieved context falls below 15,000 characters, while a high-redundancy input exceeding 30,000 characters stabilizes the Hallucination-Free Rate (HFR) above 85%. In an ecological validity blind test conducted with a top-tier Chinese technology media outlet, the DeepNews system--built on a previous-generation model (DeepSeek-V3-0324)-achieved a 25% submission acceptance rate, significantly outperforming the 0% acceptance rate of zero-shot generation by a state-of-the-art (SOTA) model (GPT-5).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDeepNews\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u7c92\u5ea6\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u6a21\u5f0f\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6218\u7565\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u91d1\u878d\u957f\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u3001\u903b\u8f91\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u4e0e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8868\u8fbe\u7684'\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u4e09\u89d2'\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5a92\u4f53\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709SOTA\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5782\u76f4\u9886\u57df\u957f\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u4f4e\u5e7b\u89c9\u3001\u9ad8\u903b\u8f91\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u4e0e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8868\u8fbe\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u7684'\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4'\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u6839\u6e90\u5728\u4e8e\u7edf\u8ba1\u5e73\u6ed1\u9677\u9631\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u4e13\u5bb6\u5199\u4f5c\u6240\u9700\u7684\u9ad8\u71b5\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDeepNews\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u89c5\u98df\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u53cc\u7c92\u5ea6\u68c0\u7d22\uff0810:1\u9971\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u6bd4\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d9\u4e8b\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u539f\u5b50\u5757\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u5f15\u5bfc\u6218\u7565\u89c4\u5212\uff1b3\uff09\u542b\u8282\u594f\u4e2d\u65ad\u4e0e\u903b\u8f91\u8ff7\u96fe\u7b49\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\u91d1\u878d\u62a5\u9053\u5b58\u5728'\u77e5\u8bc6\u65ad\u5d16'\uff1a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f4e\u4e8e15,000\u5b57\u7b26\u65f6\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u9aa4\u964d\uff1b\u8d8530,000\u5b57\u7b26\u65f6\u5e7b\u89c9\u81ea\u7531\u7387\uff08HFR\uff09\u7a33\u5b9a\u572885%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff1b\u5728\u4e2d\u6587\u5934\u90e8\u79d1\u6280\u5a92\u4f53\u76f2\u6d4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eDeepSeek-V3-0324\u7684DeepNews\u63d0\u4ea4\u63a5\u53d7\u7387\u8fbe25%\uff0c\u8fdc\u8d85GPT-5\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u751f\u6210\u76840%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e13\u5bb6\u8ba4\u77e5\u6d41\u7a0b\u53ef\u7a81\u7834\u7edf\u8ba1\u5e73\u6ed1\u9677\u9631\uff0cDeepNews\u4e3a\u5782\u76f4\u9886\u57df\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u957f\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u3001\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose a different paradigm by adopting diffusion models to provide suggestions to the autoregressive generation rather than replacing them. By doing so, we combine the bidirectional and refining capabilities of the former with the strong linguistic structure provided by the latter. To showcase its effectiveness, we present Show, Suggest and Tell (SST), which achieves State-of-the-Art results on COCO, among models in a similar setting. In particular, SST achieves 125.1 CIDEr-D on the COCO dataset without Reinforcement Learning, outperforming both autoregressive and diffusion model State-of-the-Art results by 1.5 and 2.5 points. On top of the strong results, we performed extensive experiments to validate the proposal and analyze the impact of the suggestion module. Results demonstrate a positive correlation between suggestion and caption quality, overall indicating a currently underexplored but promising research direction.

Among systems leveraging this, magnetic field-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems are particularly attractive because they can provide positioning information and build a magnetic field map on the fly. Moreover, they have bounded error within mapped regions. However, state-of-the-art methods typically require low-drift odometry data provided by visual odometry or a wheel encoder, etc. This is because these systems need to minimize/reduce positioning errors while exploring, which happens when they are in unmapped regions. To address these limitations, this work proposes a loosely coupled and a tightly coupled inertial magnetic SLAM (IM-SLAM) system. The proposed systems use commonly available low-cost sensors: an inertial measurement unit (IMU), a magnetometer array, and a barometer. The use of non-visual data provides a significant advantage over visual-based systems, making it robust to low-visibility conditions. Both systems employ state-space representations, and magnetic field models on different scales. The difference lies in how they use a local and global magnetic field model. The loosely coupled system uses these models separately in two state-space models, while the tightly coupled system integrates them into one state-space model. Experiment results show that the tightly coupled IM-SLAM system achieves lower positioning errors than the loosely coupled system in most scenarios, with typical errors on the order of meters per 100 meters traveled. These results demonstrate the feasiblity of developing a full 3D IM-SLAM systems using low-cost sensors and the potential of applying these systems in emergency response scenarios such as mine/fire rescue.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u60ef\u6027\u4e0e\u78c1\u529b\u8ba1\u7684SLAM\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08IM-SLAM\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u4e3a\u677e\u8026\u5408\u4e0e\u7d27\u8026\u5408\u4e24\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u4f4e\u6210\u672cIMU\u3001\u78c1\u529b\u8ba1\u9635\u5217\u548c\u6c14\u538b\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u89c6\u89c9\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u76843D\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u5efa\u56fe\uff0c\u8bef\u5dee\u7ea6\u6bcf\u767e\u7c73\u51e0\u7c73\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u77ff\u4e95/\u706b\u707e\u6551\u63f4\u7b49\u4f4e\u53ef\u89c1\u5ea6\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u78c1SLAM\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u4f4e\u6f02\u79fb\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\uff08\u5982\u89c6\u89c9\u6216\u8f6e\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff09\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u672a\u5efa\u56fe\u533a\u57df\u63a7\u5236\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\uff1b\u4e14\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4f4e\u80fd\u89c1\u5ea6\u4e0b\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7eaf\u975e\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u9c81\u68d2SLAM\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u677e\u8026\u5408\u4e0e\u7d27\u8026\u5408\u4e24\u79cdIM-SLAM\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u5747\u91c7\u7528IMU\u3001\u78c1\u529b\u8ba1\u9635\u5217\u548c\u6c14\u538b\u8ba1\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u78c1\u573a\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5c40\u90e8+\u5168\u5c40\uff09\uff1b\u677e\u8026\u5408\u5c06\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u7f6e\u4e8e\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u7d27\u8026\u5408\u5219\u7edf\u4e00\u6574\u5408\u8fdb\u5355\u4e00\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u5747\u57fa\u4e8e\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u78c1\u573a\u5efa\u56fe\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u7d27\u8026\u5408IM-SLAM\u5728\u591a\u6570\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u4f4e\u4e8e\u677e\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5178\u578b\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a\u6bcf100\u7c73\u884c\u7a0b\u6570\u7c73\uff1b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4ec5\u7528\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u51683D IM-SLAM\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7d27\u8026\u5408IM-SLAM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u884c\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4e\u53ef\u89c1\u5ea6\u5e94\u6025\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u77ff\u96be\u3001\u706b\u707e\u6551\u63f4\uff09\u7684\u975e\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u5efa\u56fe\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6446\u8131\u4e86\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u6216\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002"}}

Unlike approaches that require agents to stop and deliberate, our system enables LLM-based route planning while agents are moving, significantly reducing intersection wait times. Under high traffic, agents average just 0.75 seconds of decision latency. To coordinate many agents in real-time, we implement a non-blocking asynchronous architecture using Unity coroutines and a dedicated request manager. The environment is a weighted undirected graph with live congestion metrics, updated continuously by the agents to enable shared perception.

Causal discovery aims to recover a graph from data that succinctly describes these cause-effect relationships. However, current methods face several challenges, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data and complex dependencies. Incorporating prior knowledge about the system can aid causal discovery. In this work, we leverage Cluster-DAGs as a prior knowledge framework to warm-start causal discovery. We show that Cluster-DAGs offer greater flexibility than existing approaches based on tiered background knowledge and introduce two modified constraint-based algorithms, Cluster-PC and Cluster-FCI, for causal discovery in the fully and partially observed setting, respectively.

These inferred persona attributes are then incorporated into the response generation prompt to produce user-tailored replies. To encourage diverse yet faithful generations, we adjust decoding temperature during inference.

While recent foundation models for echocardiography can achieve strong performance on individual perceptual subtasks such as view classification, segmentation, or disease prediction, they typically operate in isolation and do not provide a unified, clinically coherent assessment. In this work, we introduce Echo-CoPilot, a multi-view, multi-task agent that uses a large language model to orchestrate a suite of specialized echocardiography tools. Within a ReAct-style loop, the agent decomposes clinician queries, invokes tools for view recognition, cardiac structure segmentation, measurement and disease prediction, and report synthesis, and integrates their outputs into guideline-aware answers and narrative summaries. We evaluate Echo-CoPilot on the public MIMIC-EchoQA benchmark, where it achieves an accuracy of 50.8\\%, outperforming both general-purpose and biomedical video vision-language models. Qualitative analyses further show that the agent leverages quantitative measurements and physiologic context to resolve challenging cases near clinical decision thresholds, such as borderline left ventricular hypertrophy or pericardial effusion severity.

Most of these approaches are trained to model conditional distributions defined by a specific predictive direction with a specific set of input variables. We introduce MetaVoxel, a generative joint diffusion modeling framework that models the joint distribution over imaging data and clinical metadata by learning a single diffusion process spanning all variables. By capturing the joint distribution, MetaVoxel unifies tasks that traditionally require separate conditional models and supports flexible zero-shot inference using arbitrary subsets of inputs without task-specific retraining. Using more than 10,000 T1-weighted MRI scans paired with clinical metadata from nine datasets, we show that a single MetaVoxel model can perform image generation, age estimation, and sex prediction, achieving performance comparable to established task-specific baselines. Additional experiments highlight its capabilities for flexible inference.Together, these findings demonstrate that joint multimodal diffusion offers a promising direction for unifying medical AI models and enabling broader clinical applicability.", "AI": {"tldr": "MetaVoxel\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u8054\u5408\u6269\u6563\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e2a\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u5143\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u79cd\u533b\u7597AI\u4efb\u52a1\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7075\u6d3b\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u53d8\u91cf\u5efa\u6a21\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff1b\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u80fd\u5efa\u6a21\u5f71\u50cf\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u8054\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMetaVoxel\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u5f71\u50cf\uff08\u5982T1\u52a0\u6743MRI\uff09\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u5143\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u5e74\u9f84\u3001\u6027\u522b\uff09\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6765\u81ea9\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u768410,000+\u4f8bMRI\u53ca\u914d\u5957\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5355\u4e2aMetaVoxel\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u540c\u65f6\u5b8c\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u3001\u5e74\u9f84\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u6027\u522b\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8e\u5404\u4efb\u52a1\u4e13\u7528\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u7075\u6d3b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8054\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6269\u6563\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u533b\u7597AI\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u4e34\u5e8a\u9002\u7528\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Each sub-task is associated with a stage-specific context, including a reward function, an action space, and a state abstraction function. This contextual information enables efficient intra-stage guidance and improves learning efficiency by reducing the state-action space and guiding exploration within clearly defined boundaries. In addition, transition rewards are introduced to encourage or penalize transitions between stages which guides the model toward desirable stage sequences and further accelerates convergence. When integrated with the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm, the proposed method achieved a 95% success rate across 1,000 simulated grasping tasks encompassing diverse objects, affordances, and grasp topologies. It outperformed the state-of-the-art methods in both learning speed and success rate. The approach was transferred to a real robot, where it achieved a success rate of 83.3% in 60 grasping tasks over six affordances. These experimental results demonstrate superior accuracy, data efficiency, and learning efficiency. They underscore the model's potential to advance task-oriented grasping in both simulated and real-world settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5956\u52b1\u673a\uff08Contextual Reward Machine\uff09\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u6293\u53d6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u5f15\u5165\u9636\u6bb5\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u8fc7\u6e21\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u5f02\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u5347\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u6293\u53d6\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u72b6\u6001-\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5927\u3001\u63a2\u7d22\u65e0\u5e8f\u3001\u6536\u655b\u6162\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6293\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u5177\u6709\u9636\u6bb5\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff08\u542b\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u62bd\u8c61\u51fd\u6570\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u8fc7\u6e21\u5956\u52b1\u4ee5\u5f15\u5bfc\u9636\u6bb5\u95f4\u5408\u7406\u8f6c\u79fb\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408PPO\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u57281000\u4e2a\u4eff\u771f\u6293\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe95%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u8fc1\u79fb\u81f3\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u540e\uff0c\u572860\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523083.3%\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff1b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0e\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u4eff\u771f\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u6293\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u8fc1\u79fb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

It implements a multi-agent system consisting of two agents: an adult language model and a daughter language model that aims to learn the mother language. Crucially, the daughter agent does not have access to the internal knowledge of the mother language model but only to the language exemplars the mother agent generates. These experiments illustrate how this system can be used to acquire abstract grammatical knowledge. We demonstrate how statistical analyses of patterns in the input data corresponding to grammatical categories yield discrete grammatical rules. These rules are subsequently added to the grammatical knowledge of the daughter language model. To this end, hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis was applied to the utterances consecutively generated by the mother language model. It is argued that this procedure can be used to acquire structures resembling grammatical categories proposed by linguists for natural languages. Thus, it is established that non-trivial grammatical knowledge has been acquired. Moreover, the parameter configuration of this computational laboratory environment determined using training data generated by the mother language model is validated in a second experiment with a test set similarly resulting in the acquisition of non-trivial categories.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u6210\u4eba\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5973\u513f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u8bed\u8a00\u4e60\u5f97\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c42\u6b21\u805a\u7c7b\u5206\u6790\u4ece\u6bcd\u4eb2\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7edf\u8ba1\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u5f52\u7eb3\u51fa\u79bb\u6563\u8bed\u6cd5\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u4f7f\u5973\u513f\u6a21\u578b\u83b7\u5f97\u62bd\u8c61\u8bed\u6cd5\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u8bbf\u95ee\u6743\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u6837\u4f8b\u5b9e\u73b0\u62bd\u8c61\u8bed\u6cd5\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u4e60\u5f97\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u9a8c\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5c42\u6b21\u51dd\u805a\u805a\u7c7b\u5206\u6790\u5bf9\u6bcd\u4eb2\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u8bdd\u8bed\u8fdb\u884c\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ece\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u8bed\u6cd5\u8303\u7574\u5e76\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u8bed\u6cd5\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u52a0\u5165\u5973\u513f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u6cd5\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u4ece\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5f52\u7eb3\u51fa\u7c7b\u4f3c\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u5bb6\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8bed\u6cd5\u8303\u7574\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u8bed\u6cd5\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u83b7\u53d6\uff1b\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u72ec\u7acb\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u5916\u90e8\u8bed\u8a00\u6837\u4f8b\uff0c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u62bd\u8c61\u8bed\u6cd5\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u5efa\u6784\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u4e60\u5f97\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

We propose Heavy-Ball Synthetic Gradient Extrapolation (HB-SGE), a robust first-order method that combines heavy-ball momentum with predictive gradient extrapolation. Unlike classical momentum methods that accumulate historical gradients, HB-SGE estimates future gradient directions using local Taylor approximations, providing adaptive acceleration while maintaining stability. We prove convergence guarantees for strongly convex functions and demonstrate empirically that HB-SGE prevents divergence on problems where NAG and standard momentum fail. On ill-conditioned quadratics (condition number $\u03ba=50$), HB-SGE converges in 119 iterations while both SGD and NAG diverge. On the non-convex Rosenbrock function, HB-SGE achieves convergence in 2,718 iterations where classical momentum methods diverge within 10 steps.

In this paper, we study the safety degradation that comes with adapting LLMs to new tasks. We attribute this safety compromise to catastrophic forgetting and frame the problem of preserving safety when fine-tuning as a continual learning (CL) problem. We consider the fine-tuning-as-a-service setup where the user uploads their data to a service provider to get a customized model that excels on the user's selected task. We adapt several CL approaches from the literature and systematically evaluate their ability to mitigate safety degradation. These include regularization-based, memory-based, and model merging approaches. We consider two scenarios, (1) benign user data and (2) poisoned user data. Our results demonstrate that CL approaches consistently achieve lower attack success rates than standard fine-tuning. Among these, DER outperforms both other CL methods and existing safety-preserving baselines while maintaining task utility.

Under review", "summary": "We propose Conformal Lie-group Action Prediction Sets (CLAPS), a symmetry-aware conformal prediction-based algorithm that constructs, for a given action, a set guaranteed to contain the resulting system configuration at a user-defined probability. Our assurance holds under both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, non-asymptotically, and does not require strong assumptions about the true system dynamics, the uncertainty sources, or the quality of the approximate dynamics model. Typically, uncertainty quantification is tackled by making strong assumptions about the error distribution or magnitude, or by relying on uncalibrated uncertainty estimates - i.e., with no link to frequentist probabilities - which are insufficient for safe control. Recently, conformal prediction has emerged as a statistical framework capable of providing distribution-free probabilistic guarantees on test-time prediction accuracy. While current conformal methods treat robots as Euclidean points, many systems have non-Euclidean configurations, e.g., some mobile robots have SE(2). In this work, we rigorously analyze configuration errors using Lie groups, extending previous Euclidean Space theoretical guarantees to SE(2). Our experiments on a simulated JetBot, and on a real MBot, suggest that by considering the configuration space's structure, our symmetry-informed nonconformity score leads to more volume-efficient prediction regions which represent the underlying uncertainty better than existing approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCLAPS\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u5177\u6709\u6982\u7387\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u7ed3\u679c\u914d\u7f6e\u96c6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8eSE(2)\u7b49\u674e\u7fa4\u914d\u7f6e\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5f3a\u5047\u8bbe\u6216\u672a\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b89\u5168\u63a7\u5236\u9700\u6c42\uff1b\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u914d\u7f6e\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5982SE(2)\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u57df\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u674e\u7fa4\u7406\u8bba\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u975e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5c06\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u4ece\u6b27\u6c0f\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3SE(2)\u7b49\u674e\u7fa4\u914d\u7f6e\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u5e03\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6982\u7387\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771fJetBot\u548c\u771f\u5b9eMBot\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86CLAPS\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u4f53\u79ef\u66f4\u5c0f\u3001\u66f4\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u771f\u5b9e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u674e\u7fa4\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4e0e\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\uff0cCLAPS\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u975e\u6b27\u914d\u7f6e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u52a8\u4f5c\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6982\u7387\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b89\u5168\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Although a variety of static medical question-answering (QA) benchmarks have been proposed, many aspects remain underexplored, such as the effectiveness of LLMs in generating responses in dynamic, interactive clinical multi-turn conversation situations and the identification of multi-faceted evaluation strategies beyond simple accuracy. However, formally evaluating a dynamic, interactive clinical situation is hindered by its vast combinatorial space of possible patient states and interaction trajectories, making it difficult to standardize and quantitatively measure such scenarios. Here, we introduce AutoMedic, a multi-agent simulation framework that enables automated evaluation of LLMs as clinical conversational agents. AutoMedic transforms off-the-shelf static QA datasets into virtual patient profiles, enabling realistic and clinically grounded multi-turn clinical dialogues between LLM agents. The performance of various clinical conversational agents is then assessed based on our CARE metric, which provides a multi-faceted evaluation standard of clinical conversational accuracy, efficiency/strategy, empathy, and robustness.

Multiple-Reference Preference Optimization (MRPO) builds on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) by fine-tuning LLMs on preference datasets while regularizing the policy towards a mixture of reference models to leverage their collective desirable properties. However, current methods for setting the reference weights are ad-hoc and statistically unsound, leading to unreliable performance. To address this, we introduce four new weighting strategies: two offline methods that leverage held-out validation signal; one online method that uses a sliding-window estimator to reduce overfitting; and an online method that treats reference weighting as a $K$-armed bandit via Thompson Sampling. Experiments using Qwen2.5-0.5B as the policy model and seven reference models from the Llama, Mistral, Qwen, Yi, and Phi families (0.5B-14B each) show that all 4 of our strategies outperform the current MRPO weighting methods on UltraFeedback and SafeRLHF in preference accuracy.

However, existing methods and tools often struggle with the realities of scientific literature: long-context documents, multi-modal content, and reconciling varied and inconsistent fine-grained information across multiple publications into standardized formats. These challenges are further compounded when the desired data schema or extraction ontology changes rapidly, making it difficult to re-architect or fine-tune existing systems. We present SciEx, a modular and composable framework that decouples key components including PDF parsing, multi-modal retrieval, extraction, and aggregation.

Recently, agricultural robots have been developed to detect and remove weeds using mechanical tools or precise herbicide sprays. Mechanical weeding is inefficient over large fields, and herbicides harm the soil ecosystem. Laser weeding with mobile robots has emerged as a sustainable alternative in precision farming. In this paper, we present an autonomous weeding robot that uses controlled exposure to a low energy laser beam for weed removal. The proposed robot is six-wheeled with a novel double four-bar suspension for higher stability. The laser is guided towards the detected weeds by a three-dimensional linear actuation mechanism. Field tests have demonstrated the robot's capability to navigate agricultural terrains effectively by overcoming obstacles up to 15 cm in height. At an optimal speed of 42.5 cm/s, the robot achieves a weed detection rate of 86.2\\% and operating time of 87 seconds per meter. The laser actuation mechanism maintains a minimal mean positional error of 1.54 mm, combined with a high hit rate of 97\\%, ensuring effective and accurate weed removal. This combination of speed, accuracy, and efficiency highlights the robot's potential for significantly enhancing precision farming practices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4e\u80fd\u91cf\u6fc0\u5149\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u9664\u8349\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u516d\u8f6e\u5e95\u76d8\u4e0e\u53cc\u56db\u8fde\u6746\u60ac\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u54083D\u7ebf\u6027\u6267\u884c\u673a\u6784\u7cbe\u51c6\u5f15\u5bfc\u6fc0\u5149\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u519c\u7530\u590d\u6742\u5730\u5f62\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u6e05\u9664\u6742\u8349\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u68b0\u9664\u8349\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u5316\u5b66\u9664\u8349\u5242\u7834\u574f\u571f\u58e4\u751f\u6001\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u519c\u4e1a\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u516d\u8f6e\u81ea\u4e3b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u914d\u5907\u53cc\u56db\u8fde\u6746\u60ac\u67b6\u548c\u4e09\u7ef4\u7ebf\u6027\u6fc0\u5149\u5bfc\u5411\u673a\u6784\uff1b\u96c6\u6210\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u6fc0\u5149\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u7530\u95f4\u5b9e\u5730\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5176\u5bfc\u822a\u3001\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u9664\u8349\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u53ef\u8d8a\u969c15 cm\uff1b\u4ee542.5 cm/s\u901f\u5ea6\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\uff0c\u6742\u8349\u68c0\u6d4b\u7387\u8fbe86.2%\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e1a\u8017\u65f687\u79d2/\u7c73\uff1b\u6fc0\u5149\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5e73\u5747\u8bef\u5dee\u4ec51.54 mm\uff0c\u547d\u4e2d\u738797%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6fc0\u5149\u9664\u8349\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7cbe\u51c6\u519c\u4e1a\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Existing approaches have largely focused on valuing on-ball actions, leaving much of defenders' true impact unmeasured. To address this gap, we propose DEFCON (DEFensive CONtribution evaluator), a comprehensive framework that quantifies player-level defensive contributions for every attacking situation in soccer. Leveraging Graph Attention Networks, DEFCON estimates the success probability and expected value of each attacking option, along with each defender's responsibility for stopping it. These components yield an Expected Possession Value (EPV) for the attacking team before and after each action, and DEFCON assigns positive or negative credits to defenders according to whether they reduced or increased the opponent's EPV.

This paper explores the challenges of adapting an English-trained VLM to different languages. To this end, we will explore and compare different methods for their performance and computational cost. We consider a translation-based pipeline, LoRA finetuning, and a two-stage finetuning strategy that separates vision adaptation from language adaptation. To evaluate these methods, we use a combination of standard multimodal benchmarks translated into the target language and manual assessments by native experts. The results reveal that dataset translation remains a major bottleneck in multilingual VLM performance, with data quality limiting the effectiveness of training and evaluation. These findings suggest that future efforts should focus on native-language dataset collection and improved translation strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5c06\u82f1\u6587\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u9002\u914d\u5230\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u3001LoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5fae\u8c03\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u8bed\u8a00VLM\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u4e3b\u8981\u9762\u5411\u82f1\u8bed\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u975e\u82f1\u8bed\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u7684\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u62d3\u5c55\u81f3\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u9002\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u3001LoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u5206\u79bb\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u9002\u914d\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5fae\u8c03\uff1b\u8bc4\u4f30\u91c7\u7528\u7ffb\u8bd1\u540e\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0e\u6bcd\u8bed\u4e13\u5bb6\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\u662f\u591a\u8bed\u8a00VLM\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e25\u91cd\u5236\u7ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u5e94\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u539f\u751f\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u6539\u8fdb\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Despite their broad utility in drug discovery and protein engineering, the technical complexity of MD setup, encompassing parameterization, input preparation, and software configuration, remains a major barrier for widespread and efficient usage. Agentic LLMs have demonstrated their capacity to autonomously execute multi-step scientific processes, and to date, they have not successfully been used to automate protein-ligand MD workflows. Here, we present DynaMate, a modular multi-agent framework that autonomously designs and executes complete MD workflows for both protein and protein-ligand systems, and offers free energy binding affinity calculations with the MM/PB(GB)SA method. The framework integrates dynamic tool use, web search, PaperQA, and a self-correcting behavior. DynaMate comprises three specialized modules, interacting to plan the experiment, perform the simulation, and analyze the results.

However, achieving both high load capacity and adaptive compliance in a compact form remains challenging. This paper presents an under-actuated tendon-driven robotic finger (UTRF) featuring a synchronous tendon routing that mechanically couples all joints with fixed angular velocity ratios, enabling the entire finger to be actuated by a single actuator. This approach significantly reduces the number of actuators required in multi-finger hands, resulting in a lighter and more compact structure without sacrificing stiffness or compliance. The kinematic and static models of the finger are derived, incorporating tendon elasticity to predict structural stiffness. A single-finger prototype was fabricated and tested under static loading, showing an average deflection prediction error of 1.0 mm (0.322% of total finger length) and a measured stiffness of 1.2x10^3 N/m under a 3 kg tip load. Integration into a five-finger robotic hand (UTRF-RoboHand) demonstrates effective object manipulation across diverse scenarios, confirming that the proposed routing achieves predictable stiffness and reliable grasping performance with a minimal actuator count.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5355\u9a71\u52a8\u3001\u540c\u6b65\u7ef3\u7d22\u8def\u7531\u7684\u6b20\u9a71\u52a8\u8171\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u68b0\u624b\u6307\uff08UTRF\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fa\u5b9a\u89d2\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u673a\u68b0\u8026\u5408\u6240\u6709\u5173\u8282\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u521a\u5ea6\u4e0e\u987a\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c0f\u4f53\u79ef\u4e0e\u91cd\u91cf\uff1b\u5efa\u6a21\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u7ef3\u7d22\u5f39\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u4ec51.0 mm\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4e94\u6307\u624b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u591a\u573a\u666f\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8171\u9a71\u52a8\u6b20\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u68b0\u624b\u6307\u5728\u7d27\u51d1\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u9ad8\u8d1f\u8f7d\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u987a\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5177\u6709\u540c\u6b65\u8171\u8def\u7531\u7684\u6b20\u9a71\u52a8\u8171\u9a71\u52a8\u624b\u6307\uff08UTRF\uff09\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u5173\u8282\u4ee5\u56fa\u5b9a\u89d2\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u673a\u68b0\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5355\u4e2a\u6267\u884c\u5668\u9a71\u52a8\uff1b\u5efa\u7acb\u542b\u8171\u5f39\u6027\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u4e0e\u9759\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u6784\u521a\u5ea6\uff1b\u5236\u9020\u5355\u6307\u539f\u578b\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u9759\u6001\u52a0\u8f7d\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u96c6\u6210\u81f3\u4e94\u6307\u673a\u68b0\u624b\uff08UTRF-RoboHand\uff09\u9a8c\u8bc1\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5355\u6307\u539f\u578b\u57283 kg\u5c16\u7aef\u8f7d\u8377\u4e0b\u6d4b\u5f97\u521a\u5ea6\u4e3a1.2\u00d710\u00b3 N/m\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6320\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a1.0 mm\uff08\u5360\u603b\u957f0.322%\uff09\uff1b\u4e94\u6307\u96c6\u6210\u624b\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u7269\u4f53\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u521a\u5ea6\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6293\u53d6\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u540c\u6b65\u8171\u8def\u7531\u65b9\u6848\u53ef\u5728\u6781\u7b80\u6267\u884c\u5668\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u521a\u5ea6\u3001\u826f\u597d\u987a\u5e94\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7d27\u51d1\u578b\u591a\u6307\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

While open-weight LLMs enable local deployment, no single model dominates all tasks, motivating ensemble approaches. However, existing LLM ensembles focus on text generation or classification, leaving NER under-explored. In this context, this work proposes a novel three-step ensemble pipeline for zero-shot NER using similarly capable, locally run LLMs. Our method outperforms individual LLMs in four out of five Portuguese NER datasets by leveraging a heuristic to select optimal model combinations with minimal annotated data. Moreover, we show that ensembles obtained on different source datasets generally outperform individual LLMs in cross-dataset configurations, potentially eliminating the need for annotated data for the current task.

Existing open-source coding agents provide transparency but frequently fall short when pushed to these industrial-scale workloads, while proprietary coding agents offer strong practical performance but limited extensibility, interpretability, and controllability. We present the Confucius Code Agent (CCA), an open-sourced AI software engineer that can operate at an industrial scale. CCA is built atop the Confucius SDK, an open-sourced agent development platform designed around three complementary perspectives: Agent Experience (AX), User Experience (UX), and Developer Experience (DX). The SDK introduces a unified orchestrator with hierarchical working memory for long-context reasoning, a persistent note-taking system for cross-session continual learning, and a modular extension module for robust tool use. Moreover, a meta-agent automates the synthesis, evaluation, and refinement of agent configurations through a build-test-improve loop, enabling rapid agent development on new tasks, environments, and tool stacks. Instantiated on Confucius SDK with these mechanisms, CCA delivers strong performance on real-world software engineering tasks. On SWE-Bench-Pro, CCA achieves a state-of-the-art Resolve@1 performance of 54.3%, substantially improving over prior coding agents. Together, the Confucius SDK and CCA provide a transparent, extensible, and reproducible foundation for AI agents, bridge gaps between research prototypes and production-grade systems, and support agent development and deployment at industrial scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Confucius Code Agent\uff08CCA\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u90e8\u7f72\u7684AI\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eConfucius SDK\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u8de8\u4f1a\u8bdd\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\u534f\u8c03\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728SWE-Bench-Pro\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523054.3%\u7684SOTA Resolve@1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u6e90\u7f16\u7801\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u95ed\u6e90\u65b9\u6848\u53c8\u727a\u7272\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\uff1b\u4e9f\u9700\u517c\u987e\u900f\u660e\u6027\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faConfucius SDK\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u878d\u5408Agent Experience\uff08AX\uff09\u3001User Experience\uff08UX\uff09\u548cDeveloper Experience\uff08DX\uff09\u4e09\u91cd\u89c6\u89d2\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u5c42\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3001\u6301\u4e45\u5316\u7b14\u8bb0\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6269\u5c55\u673a\u5236\u53ca\u5143\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u81ea\u52a8\u8c03\u4f18\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u6784\u5efaCCA\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u5728SWE-Bench-Pro\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u621054.3%\u7684Resolve@1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u5148\u524d\u5f00\u6e90\u7f16\u7801\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff1b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Confucius SDK\u4e0eCCA\u5171\u540c\u6784\u6210\u900f\u660e\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684AI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u57fa\u7840\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u539f\u578b\u4e0e\u751f\u4ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5de5\u4e1a\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f00\u53d1\u4e0e\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

However, current work has been mainly focused on indoor, household scenarios. In this work, we present SimWorld-Robotics~(SWR), a simulation platform for embodied AI in large-scale, photorealistic urban environments. Built on Unreal Engine 5, SWR procedurally generates unlimited photorealistic urban scenes populated with dynamic elements such as pedestrians and traffic systems, surpassing prior urban simulations in realism, complexity, and scalability. It also supports multi-robot control and communication. With these key features, we build two challenging robot benchmarks: (1) a multimodal instruction-following task, where a robot must follow vision-language navigation instructions to reach a destination in the presence of pedestrians and traffic; and (2) a multi-agent search task, where two robots must communicate to cooperatively locate and meet each other. Unlike existing benchmarks, these two new benchmarks comprehensively evaluate a wide range of critical robot capacities in realistic scenarios, including (1) multimodal instructions grounding, (2) 3D spatial reasoning in large environments, (3) safe, long-range navigation with people and traffic, (4) multi-robot collaboration, and (5) grounded communication.

Screening mammography reduces mortality, yet interpretation still suffers from substantial false negatives and false positives, and model accuracy often degrades when deployed across scanners, modalities, and patient populations. We propose a simple conditioning signal aimed at improving external performance based on a wavelet based vectorization of persistent homology. Using topological data analysis, we summarize image structure that persists across intensity thresholds and convert this information into spatial, multi scale maps that are provably stable to small intensity perturbations.

While recent vision-language large models demonstrate strong reasoning abilities, they often underperform task-specific panoramic small models in VLN tasks. To address this, we propose CLASH (Collaborative Large-Small Hierarchy), a VLN-CE framework that integrates a reactive small-model planner (RSMP) with a reflective large-model reasoner (RLMR). RSMP adopts a causal-learning-based dual-branch architecture to enhance generalization, while RLMR leverages panoramic visual prompting with chain-of-thought reasoning to support interpretable spatial understanding and navigation. We further introduce an uncertainty-aware collaboration mechanism (UCM) that adaptively fuses decisions from both models. For obstacle avoidance, in simulation, we replace the rule-based controller with a fully learnable point-goal policy, and in real-world deployment, we design a LiDAR-based clustering module for generating navigable waypoints and pair it with an online SLAM-based local controller. CLASH achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) results (ranking 1-st) on the VLN-CE leaderboard, significantly improving SR and SPL on the test-unseen set over the previous SoTA methods.

Despite the empirical success of these practices, a theoretical framework to understand and unify their macroscopic dynamics remains lacking. This Letter proposes a method based on the least action principle to estimate the underlying generative directionality of LLMs embedded within agents. By experimentally measuring the transition probabilities between LLM-generated states, we statistically discover a detailed balance in LLM-generated transitions, indicating that LLM generation may not be achieved by generally learning rule sets and strategies, but rather by implicitly learning a class of underlying potential functions that may transcend different LLM architectures and prompt templates. To our knowledge, this is the first discovery of a macroscopic physical law in LLM generative dynamics that does not depend on specific model details.

Sliding window attention (SWA) reduces this cost to linear complexity, but naively enabling complete SWA at inference-time for models pretrained with full attention (FA) causes severe long-context performance degradation due to training-inference mismatch. This makes us wonder: Can FA-pretrained LLMs be well adapted to SWA without pretraining? We investigate this by proposing Sliding Window Attention Adaptation (SWAA), a set of practical recipes that combine five methods for better adaptation: (1) applying SWA only during prefilling; (2) preserving \"sink\" tokens; (3) interleaving FA/SWA layers; (4) chain-of-thought (CoT); and (5) fine-tuning. Our experiments show that SWA adaptation is feasible while non-trivial: no single method suffices, yet specific synergistic combinations effectively recover the original long-context performance. We further analyze the performance-efficiency trade-offs of different SWAA configurations and provide recommended recipes for diverse scenarios.

We formulate coordination as a \\textit{speculative consensus} problem, where sibling streams broadcast semantic ``notes'' to a global bus, gated by a learned verification head. We validate our approach on a 50,000-step curriculum using a frozen 20B-parameter backbone.

To address these limitations, we propose CoopRAG, a novel RAG framework for the question answering task in which a retriever and an LLM work cooperatively with each other by exchanging informative knowledge, and the earlier and later layers of the retriever model work cooperatively with each other to accurately rank the retrieved documents relevant to a given query. In this framework, we (i) unroll a question into sub-questions and a reasoning chain in which uncertain positions are masked, (ii) retrieve the documents relevant to the question augmented with the sub-questions and the reasoning chain, (iii) rerank the documents by contrasting layers of the retriever, and (iv) reconstruct the reasoning chain by filling the masked positions via the LLM. Our experiments demonstrate that CoopRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art QA methods on three multi-hop QA datasets as well as a simple QA dataset in terms of both the retrieval and QA performances.

Pathways Towards Unifying AI Safety and Ethics Research", "comment": "Accepted for presentation at IASEAI 2026", "summary": "While much research in artificial intelligence (AI) has focused on scaling capabilities, the accelerating pace of development makes countervailing work on producing harmless, \"aligned\" systems increasingly urgent. Yet research on alignment has diverged along two largely parallel tracks: safety--centered on scaled intelligence, deceptive or scheming behaviors, and existential risk--and ethics--focused on present harms, the reproduction of social bias, and flaws in production pipelines. Although both communities warn of insufficient investment in alignment, they disagree on what alignment means or ought to mean. As a result, their efforts have evolved in relative isolation, shaped by distinct methodologies, institutional homes, and disciplinary genealogies.\n  We present a large-scale, quantitative study showing the structural split between AI safety and AI ethics. Using a bibliometric and co-authorship network analysis of 6,442 papers from twelve major ML and NLP conferences (2020-2025), we find that over 80% of collaborations occur within either the safety or ethics communities, and cross-field connectivity is highly concentrated: roughly 5% of papers account for more than 85% of bridging links. Removing a small number of these brokers sharply increases segregation, indicating that cross-disciplinary exchange depends on a handful of actors rather than broad, distributed collaboration. These results show that the safety-ethics divide is not only conceptual but institutional, with implications for research agendas, policy, and venues. We argue that integrating technical safety work with normative ethics--via shared benchmarks, cross-institutional venues, and mixed-method methodologies--is essential for building AI systems that are both robust and just.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6587\u732e\u8ba1\u91cf\u4e0e\u5408\u8457\u7f51\u7edc\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86AI\u5b89\u5168\u4e0eAI\u4f26\u7406\u4e24\u5927\u7814\u7a76\u9886\u57df\u5728\u673a\u6784\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5272\u88c2\uff1a80%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u5408\u4f5c\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5404\u81ea\u793e\u533a\uff0c\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u8fde\u63a5\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5c11\u6570\u2018\u6865\u6881\u578b\u2019\u5b66\u8005\uff08\u4ec55%\u8bba\u6587\u8d21\u732e85%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u6865\u63a5\u94fe\u63a5\uff09\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4e8c\u8005\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6982\u5ff5\u5206\u6b67\uff0c\u66f4\u5b58\u5728\u6df1\u5c42\u5236\u5ea6\u9694\u79bb\uff1b\u4f5c\u8005\u547c\u5401\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u57fa\u51c6\u3001\u8de8\u673a\u6784\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0e\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6280\u672f\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u89c4\u8303\u4f26\u7406\u7684\u5b9e\u8d28\u6027\u878d\u5408\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08alignment\uff09\u7814\u7a76\u65e5\u76ca\u7d27\u8feb\uff0c\u4f46\u5b89\u5168\uff08\u5173\u6ce8\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u3001\u6b3a\u9a97\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u751f\u5b58\u98ce\u9669\uff09\u4e0e\u4f26\u7406\uff08\u5173\u6ce8\u73b0\u5b9e\u4f24\u5bb3\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\u3001\u751f\u4ea7\u6d41\u7a0b\u7f3a\u9677\uff09\u4e24\u5927\u8def\u5f84\u957f\u671f\u5e73\u884c\u53d1\u5c55\u3001\u5b9a\u4e49\u5206\u6b67\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5b9e\u8bc1\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u5272\u88c2\u73b0\u72b6\u5e76\u63a8\u52a8\u6574\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u5bf92020\u20132025\u5e7412\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41ML/NLP\u4f1a\u8bae\u51716442\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u5f00\u5c55 bibliometric \u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5408\u8457\u7f51\u7edc\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u4f26\u7406\u793e\u533a\u5185\u90e8/\u8de8\u793e\u533a\u5408\u4f5c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3001\u6865\u63a5\u94fe\u63a5\u5206\u5e03\u53ca\u5173\u952e\u8282\u70b9\u79fb\u9664\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u8d8580%\u5408\u4f5c\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u793e\u533a\uff1b\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u8fde\u63a5\u6781\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u2014\u2014\u7ea65%\u8bba\u6587\u8d21\u732e\u8d8585%\u6865\u63a5\u94fe\u63a5\uff1b\u79fb\u9664\u5c11\u91cf\u6838\u5fc3\u2018\u6865\u6881\u2019\u4f5c\u8005\u5373\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u5267\u793e\u533a\u9694\u79bb\uff1b\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5272\u88c2\u517c\u5177\u6982\u5ff5\u6027\u4e0e\u5236\u5ea6\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u5b89\u5168\u4e0eAI\u4f26\u7406\u7684\u5272\u88c2\u5df2\u56fa\u5316\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u987b\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u5efa\u57fa\u51c6\u3001\u8de8\u673a\u6784\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0e\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u5b9e\u73b0\u6df1\u5ea6\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u65b9\u80fd\u6784\u5efa\u65e2\u9c81\u68d2\u53c8\u516c\u6b63\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Most prior work uses natural language to express chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before producing driving actions. However, text may not be the most efficient representation for reasoning. In this work, we present Latent-CoT-Drive (LCDrive): a model that expresses CoT in a latent language that captures possible outcomes of the driving actions being considered. Our approach unifies CoT reasoning and decision making by representing both in an action-aligned latent space. Instead of natural language, the model reasons by interleaving (1) action-proposal tokens, which use the same vocabulary as the model's output actions; and (2) world model tokens, which are grounded in a learned latent world model and express future outcomes of these actions. We cold start latent CoT by supervising the model's action proposals and world model tokens based on ground-truth future rollouts of the scene. We then post-train with closed-loop reinforcement learning to strengthen reasoning capabilities. On a large-scale end-to-end driving benchmark, LCDrive achieves faster inference, better trajectory quality, and larger improvements from interactive reinforcement learning compared to both non-reasoning and text-reasoning baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLatent-CoT-Drive\uff08LCDrive\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u94fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\uff08CoT\uff09\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u3002\u5b83\u7528\u52a8\u4f5c\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u66ff\u4ee3\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u52a8\u4f5c\u63d0\u8bae\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u672a\u6765\u72b6\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u771f\u5b9e\u8f68\u8ff9\u76d1\u7763\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u548c\u95ed\u73af\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u8f68\u8ff9\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4f5c\u4e3a\u94fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\uff08CoT\uff09\u7684\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u5f0f\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u6548\u7387\u4e0d\u9ad8\uff1b\u9700\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u53ef\u5fae\u4e14\u80fd\u76f4\u63a5\u5173\u8054\u672a\u6765\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLCDrive\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0e\u8f93\u51fa\u52a8\u4f5c\u5171\u4eab\u8bcd\u8868\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u63d0\u8baetoken\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578btoken\uff0c\u8868\u5f81\u5404\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u672a\u6765\u7ed3\u679c\uff1b\u4e8c\u8005\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4ea4\u66ff\u751f\u6210\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u771f\u5b9e\u672a\u6765\u8f68\u8ff9\u76d1\u7763\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\uff0c\u518d\u4ee5\u95ed\u73af\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u9a7e\u9a76\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cLCDrive\u76f8\u6bd4\u65e0\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1a\u63a8\u7406\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u8f68\u8ff9\u8d28\u91cf\u66f4\u9ad8\u3001\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u589e\u76ca\u66f4\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5efa\u6a21\u94fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\uff08Latent-CoT\uff09\u6bd4\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00CoT\u66f4\u9002\u914d\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Learning process takes time. Babies start learning to move in the restricted liquid area called placenta. Children often are limited by underdeveloped body. Even adults are not allowed to participate in complex competitions right away. However, with robots, when learning from scratch, we often don't have the privilege of waiting for dozen millions of steps. \"Swaddling\" regularization is responsible for restraining an agent in rapid but unstable development penalizing action strength in a specific way not affecting actions directly. The Symphony, Transitional-policy Deterministic Actor and Critic algorithm, is a concise combination of different ideas for possibility of training humanoid robots from scratch with Sample Efficiency, Sample Proximity and Safety of Actions in mind. It is no secret that continuous increase in Gaussian noise without appropriate smoothing is harmful for motors and gearboxes. Compared to Stochastic algorithms, we set a limited parametric noise and promote a reduced strength of actions, safely increasing entropy, since the actions are kind of immersed in weaker noise. When actions require more extreme values, actions rise above the weak noise. Training becomes empirically much safer for both the environment around and the robot's mechanisms. We use Fading Replay Buffer: using a fixed formula containing the hyperbolic tangent, we adjust the batch sampling probability: the memory contains a recent memory and a long-term memory trail. Fading Replay Buffer allows us to use Temporal Advantage when we improve the current Critic Network prediction compared to the exponential moving average.

We show that LLMs develop linear representations of user demographics within activation space, wherein stereotypically associated attributes are encoded along interpretable geometric directions. We first probe residual streams across layers of four open transformer-based LLMs (Magistral 24B, Qwen3 14B, GPT-OSS 20B, OLMo2-1B) prompted with explicit demographic disclosure. We show that the same probes predict demographics from implicit cues: names activate census-aligned gender and race representations, while occupations trigger representations correlated with real-world workforce statistics. These linear representations allow us to explain demographic inferences implicitly formed by LLMs during conversation. We demonstrate that these implicit demographic representations actively shape downstream behavior, such as career recommendations.

Consequently, this paradigm is bandwidth intensive, scales poorly, and exposes raw images to third parties. Recent efforts in the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) redesigned the pipeline for machine-to-machine communication: Video Coding for Machines (VCM) is designed to apply task-aware coding tools in the pixel domain, and Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) is designed to compress intermediate neural features to reduce bitrate, preserve privacy, and support compute offload. Experiments show that FCM is capable of maintaining accuracy close to edge inference while significantly reducing bitrate. Additional analysis of H.26X codecs used as inner codecs in FCM reveals that H.265/High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) and H.266/Versatile Video Coding (VVC) achieve almost identical machine task performance, with an average BD-Rate increase of 1.39% when VVC is replaced with HEVC. In contrast, H.264/Advanced Video Coding (AVC) yields an average BD-Rate increase of 32.28% compared to VVC. However, for the tracking task, the impact of codec choice is minimal, with HEVC outperforming VVC and achieving BD Rate of -1.81% and 8.79% for AVC, indicating that existing hardware for already deployed codecs can support machine-to-machine communication without degrading performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u673a\u5668\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u7801\u6846\u67b6\uff08FCM\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u800c\u975e\u539f\u59cb\u50cf\u7d20\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5e26\u5bbd\u3001\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u5378\u8f7d\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eHEVC\u4e0eVVC\u5728\u591a\u6570\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u8fd1\uff0c\u800cH.264\u6027\u80fd\u8f83\u5dee\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u73b0\u6709\u786c\u4ef6\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5df2\u8db3\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u591a\u91c7\u7528\u9762\u5411\u4eba\u773c\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u7801\uff08\u5982H.264/HEVC/VVC\uff09\u4f20\u8f93\u539f\u59cb\u50cf\u7d20\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5e26\u5bbd\u6d6a\u8d39\u3001\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\u53ca\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\uff1b\u4e9f\u9700\u9762\u5411\u673a\u5668\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u7f16\u7801\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFeature Coding for Machines\uff08FCM\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u538b\u7f29\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u5c06H.264\u3001HEVC\u548cVVC\u4f5c\u4e3aFCM\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u538b\u7f29\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff09\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5176BD-Rate\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6743\u8861\u3002", "result": "FCM\u53ef\u5728\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u63a5\u8fd1\u8fb9\u7f18\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1bHEVC\u4e0eVVC\u5728\u591a\u6570\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e00\u81f4\uff08BD-Rate\u5dee\u5f02\u4ec51.39%\uff09\uff0c\u800cH.264\u6bd4VVC\u5dee32.28%\uff1b\u4f46\u5728\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cHEVC\u7565\u4f18\u4e8eVVC\uff08BD-Rate -1.81%\uff09\uff0cH.264\u4ecd\u53ef\u7528\uff08+8.79%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "FCM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u673a\u5668\u89c6\u89c9\u901a\u4fe1\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff1b\u73b0\u6709HEVC\u786c\u4ef6\u5df2\u80fd\u8f83\u597d\u652f\u6491\u591a\u6570\u673a\u5668\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5168\u9762\u5347\u7ea7\u81f3VVC\uff0c\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u5feb\u901f\u90e8\u7f72\u4e0e\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper presents a unified GNSS/UWB/IMU fusion framework for seamless pedestrian localization and provides a controlled comparison of three probabilistic back-ends: an error-state extended Kalman filter, sliding-window factor graph optimization, and a particle filter. The system uses chest-mounted IMU-based PDR as the motion backbone and integrates absolute updates from GNSS outdoors and UWB indoors. To enhance transition robustness and mitigate urban GNSS degradation, we introduce a lightweight map-based feasibility constraint derived from OpenStreetMap building footprints, treating most building interiors as non-navigable while allowing motion inside a designated UWB-instrumented building. The framework is implemented in ROS 2 and runs in real time on a wearable platform, with visualization in Foxglove. We evaluate three scenarios: indoor (UWB+PDR), outdoor (GNSS+PDR), and seamless outdoor-indoor (GNSS+UWB+PDR).

These tools generate \"tortured phrases\", statistically improbable synonyms (e.g. \"counterfeit consciousness\" for \"artificial intelligence\"), that preserve the local grammar while obscuring the original source. Most existing detection methods depend heavily on static blocklists or general-domain language models, which suffer from high false-negative rates for novel obfuscations and cannot determine the source of the plagiarized content. In this paper, we propose Semantic Reconstruction of Adversarial Plagiarism (SRAP), a framework designed not only to detect these anomalies but to mathematically recover the original terminology. We use a two-stage architecture: (1) statistical anomaly detection with a domain-specific masked language model (SciBERT) using token-level pseudo-perplexity, and (2) source-based semantic reconstruction using dense vector retrieval (FAISS) and sentence-level alignment (SBERT). Experiments on a parallel corpus of adversarial scientific text show that while zero-shot baselines fail completely (0.00 percent restoration accuracy), our retrieval-augmented approach achieves 23.67 percent restoration accuracy, significantly outperforming baseline methods. We also show that static decision boundaries are necessary for robust detection in jargon-heavy scientific text, since dynamic thresholding fails under high variance.

Current methods often rely on costly LLM-based techniques (e.g. annotating dataset differences) or dense embedding models (e.g. for clustering), which lack control over the properties of interest. We propose using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to create SAE embeddings: representations whose dimensions map to interpretable concepts. Through four data analysis tasks, we show that SAE embeddings are more cost-effective and reliable than LLMs and more controllable than dense embeddings. Using the large hypothesis space of SAEs, we can uncover insights such as (1) semantic differences between datasets and (2) unexpected concept correlations in documents. For instance, by comparing model responses, we find that Grok-4 clarifies ambiguities more often than nine other frontier models. Relative to LLMs, SAE embeddings uncover bigger differences at 2-8x lower cost and identify biases more reliably. Additionally, SAE embeddings are controllable: by filtering concepts, we can (3) cluster documents along axes of interest and (4) outperform dense embeddings on property-based retrieval. Using SAE embeddings, we study model behavior with two case studies: investigating how OpenAI model behavior has changed over time and finding \"trigger\" phrases learned by Tulu-3 (Lambert et al., 2024) from its training data. These results position SAEs as a versatile tool for unstructured data analysis and highlight the neglected importance of interpreting models through their data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SAEs\uff09\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5d4c\u5165\uff08SAE embeddings\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6587\u672c\u8bed\u6599\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5728\u6210\u672c\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709LLM\u548c\u7a20\u5bc6\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6587\u672c\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982LLM\u6807\u6ce8\u6216\u7a20\u5bc6\u5d4c\u5165\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u3001\u4f4e\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u6216\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SAEs\uff09\u6784\u5efaSAE embeddings\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5176\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u5b9e\u73b0\u6982\u5ff5\u7ea7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5dee\u5f02\u5206\u6790\u3001\u6982\u5ff5\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u53d1\u73b0\u3001\u6309\u9700\u805a\u7c7b\u4e0e\u5c5e\u6027\u68c0\u7d22\u7b49\u56db\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8f85\u4ee5\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "SAE embeddings\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bed\u4e49\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u5dee\u65b9\u9762\u6bd4LLM\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u4f4e2\u20138\u500d\uff1b\u652f\u6301\u6309\u6982\u5ff5\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u63a7\u805a\u7c7b\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u7a20\u5bc6\u5d4c\u5165\uff1b\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eOpenAI\u6a21\u578b\u6f14\u8fdb\u5206\u6790\u548cTulu-3\u89e6\u53d1\u77ed\u8bed\u6316\u6398\u3002", "conclusion": "SAEs\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u89c6\u89d2\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, we identify a fundamental limitation in the standard DPO formulation because it relies on the Bradley-Terry model to aggregate diverse evaluation axes like aesthetic quality and semantic alignment into a single scalar reward. This aggregation creates a reward conflict where the model is forced to unlearn desirable features of a specific dimension if they appear in a globally non-preferred sample. To address this issue, we propose Multi Reward Conditional DPO (MCDPO). This method resolves reward conflicts by introducing a disentangled Bradley-Terry objective. MCDPO explicitly injects a preference outcome vector as a condition during training, which allows the model to learn the correct optimization direction for each reward axis independently within a single network. We further introduce dimensional reward dropout to ensure balanced optimization across dimensions. Extensive experiments on Stable Diffusion 1.5 and SDXL demonstrate that MCDPO achieves superior performance on benchmarks. Notably, our conditional framework enables dynamic and multiple-axis control at inference time using Classifier Free Guidance to amplify specific reward dimensions without additional training or external reward models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u5956\u52b1\u6761\u4ef6DPO\uff08MCDPO\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u6807\u51c6DPO\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u56e0\u4f7f\u7528Bradley-Terry\u6a21\u578b\u805a\u5408\u591a\u7ef4\u4eba\u7c7b\u53cd\u9988\u800c\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u504f\u597d\u5411\u91cf\u548c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5956\u52b1Dropout\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u7f51\u7edc\u5185\u5404\u7ef4\u5ea6\u72ec\u7acb\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u591a\u8f74\u52a8\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6DPO\u4f9d\u8d56Bradley-Terry\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u7f8e\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b49\u591a\u7ef4\u8bc4\u4f30\u8f74\u805a\u5408\u6210\u5355\u4e00\u6807\u91cf\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5956\u52b1\u51b2\u7a81\u2014\u2014\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u5168\u5c40\u504f\u597d\u800c\u9057\u5fd8\u67d0\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u826f\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMulti Reward Conditional DPO\uff08MCDPO\uff09\uff1a1\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u89e3\u8026\u7684Bradley-Terry\u76ee\u6807\uff1b2\uff09\u5c06\u504f\u597d\u7ed3\u679c\u5411\u91cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u6ce8\u5165\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5355\u7f51\u7edc\u80fd\u72ec\u7acb\u4f18\u5316\u5404\u5956\u52b1\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff1b3\uff09\u52a0\u5165\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5956\u52b1Dropout\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u5404\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728Stable Diffusion 1.5\u548cSDXL\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMCDPO\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u4f18\uff1b\u5176\u6761\u4ef6\u6846\u67b6\u652f\u6301\u901a\u8fc7Classifier-Free Guidance\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u589e\u5f3a\u7279\u5b9a\u5956\u52b1\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u5916\u90e8\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "MCDPO\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u591a\u7ef4\u4eba\u7c7b\u53cd\u9988\u4e2d\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u4e0e\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3aRLHF\u5728\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

In some scenarios, vision is occluded. The robot can then no longer obtain real-time scene state information through visual feedback. This is called ``blind manipulation\". In this manuscript, a novel physically-driven contact cognition method, called ``Contact SLAM\", is proposed.

Deep learning mod- els often struggle with real-world distribution changes, exhibit bias against infrequent pathologies, and lack the transparency required for deployment in safety-critical clinical environments. We introduce MedXAI (An Explainable Framework for Med- ical Imaging Classification), a unified expert knowledge based framework that integrates deep vision models with clinician- derived expert knowledge to improve generalization, reduce rare- class bias, and provide human-understandable explanations by localizing the relevant diagnostic features rather than relying on technical post-hoc methods (e.g., Saliency Maps, LIME). We evaluate MedXAI across heterogeneous modalities on two challenging tasks: (i) Seizure Onset Zone localization from resting-state fMRI, and (ii) Diabetic Retinopathy grading. Ex periments on ten multicenter datasets show consistent gains, including a 3% improvement in cross-domain generalization and a 10% improvmnet in F1 score of rare class, substantially outperforming strong deep learning baselines. Ablations confirm that the symbolic components act as effective clinical priors and regularizers, improving robustness under distribution shift.

Despite the availability of powerful open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and their pretraining data, the SSFSL literature largely neglects these open-source resources. In contrast, the related area few-shot learning (FSL) has already exploited them to boost performance. Arguably, to achieve auto-annotation in the real world, SSFSL should leverage such open-source resources. To this end, we start by applying established SSL methods to finetune a VLM. Counterintuitively, they significantly underperform FSL baselines. Our in-depth analysis reveals the root cause: VLMs produce rather ''flat'' distributions of softmax probabilities. This results in zero utilization of unlabeled data and weak supervision signals. We address this issue with embarrassingly simple techniques: classifier initialization and temperature tuning. They jointly increase the confidence scores of pseudo-labels, improving the utilization rate of unlabeled data, and strengthening supervision signals. Building on this, we propose: Stage-Wise Finetuning with Temperature Tuning (SWIFT), which enables existing SSL methods to effectively finetune a VLM on limited labeled data, abundant unlabeled data, and task-relevant but noisy data retrieved from the VLM's pretraining set. Extensive experiments on five SSFSL benchmarks show that SWIFT outperforms recent FSL and SSL methods by $\\sim$5 accuracy points. SWIFT even rivals supervised learning, which finetunes VLMs with the unlabeled data being labeled with ground truth!", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSWIFT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u548c\u6e29\u5ea6\u8c03\u4f18\u89e3\u51b3VLM\u5728\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2dsoftmax\u5206\u5e03\u8fc7\u5e73\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f4e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u5229\u7528\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ea65\u4e2a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u70b9\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u8981\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\uff08SSFSL\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709SSFSL\u7814\u7a76\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u800c\u76f8\u5173\u9886\u57dfFSL\u5df2\u6210\u529f\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64SSFSL\u4e9f\u9700\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408VLM\u4e0e\u5f00\u653e\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u53d1\u73b0VLM\u5728SSFSL\u4e2d\u56e0softmax\u5206\u5e03\u8fc7\u5e73\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u65e0\u6548\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u63d0\u51fa\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4e0e\u6e29\u5ea6\u8c03\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u5fae\u8c03\u6846\u67b6SWIFT\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u3001\u5927\u91cf\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u53ca\u4eceVLM\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u4e2d\u68c0\u7d22\u51fa\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u4f46\u542b\u566a\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8054\u5408\u5fae\u8c03VLM\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2aSSFSL\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cSWIFT\u6bd4\u8fd1\u671fFSL\u548cSSL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u5747\u9ad8\u51fa\u7ea65\u4e2a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u70b9\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u53ef\u5ab2\u7f8e\u4f7f\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\u6807\u6ce8\u5168\u90e8\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "VLM\u5728SSFSL\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u88ab\u4f4e\u4f30\uff0c\u5173\u952e\u5728\u4e8e\u6821\u51c6\u5176\u8f93\u51fa\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff1bSWIFT\u4ee5\u6781\u7b80\u8bbe\u8ba1\u91ca\u653eVLM\u5728\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

We introduce a novel neural fusion framework for ranging inertial odometry which involves a graph attention UWB network and a recurrent neural inertial network. Our graph net learns scene-relevant ranging patterns and adapts to any number of anchors or tags, realizing accurate positioning without calibration. Additionally, the integration of least squares and the incorporation of nominal frame enhance overall performance and scalability. The effectiveness and robustness of our methods are validated through extensive experiments on both public and self-collected datasets, spanning indoor, outdoor, and tunnel environments.

The existing method learns the dynamics in each discrete mode, which suffers from the combination of mode switching and discontinuities in the flows. In this work, we propose CHyLL (Continuous Hybrid System Learning in Latent Space), which learns a continuous neural representation of a hybrid system without trajectory segmentation, event functions, or mode switching. The key insight of CHyLL is that the reset map glues the state space at the guard surface, reformulating the state space as a piecewise smooth quotient manifold where the flow becomes spatially continuous. Building upon these insights and the embedding theorems grounded in differential topology, CHyLL concurrently learns a singularity-free neural embedding in a higher-dimensional space and the continuous flow in it. We showcase that CHyLL can accurately predict the flow of hybrid systems with superior accuracy and identify the topological invariants of the hybrid systems. Finally, we apply CHyLL to the stochastic optimal control problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCHyLL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6df7\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5206\u6bb5\u5149\u6ed1\u5546\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u5728\u9690\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u8fde\u7eed\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u8f68\u8ff9\u5206\u5272\u3001\u4e8b\u4ef6\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\u5207\u6362\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\u6df7\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d41\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u5176\u62d3\u6251\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u5177\u6709\u8fde\u7eed\u4e0e\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d41\u65f6\uff0c\u56e0\u6a21\u5f0f\u5207\u6362\u548c\u6d41\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u800c\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "CHyLL\u5229\u7528\u91cd\u7f6e\u6620\u5c04\u5c06\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5728\u5b88\u536b\u9762\u5904\u2018\u7c98\u5408\u2019\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u5206\u6bb5\u5149\u6ed1\u5546\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u4f7f\u6d41\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u8fde\u7eed\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u5fae\u5206\u62d3\u6251\u5d4c\u5165\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u540c\u6b65\u5b66\u4e60\u65e0\u5947\u70b9\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u795e\u7ecf\u5d4c\u5165\u53ca\u5176\u4e2d\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6d41\u3002", "result": "CHyLL\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\u6df7\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d41\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u5176\u62d3\u6251\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\uff1b\u8fd8\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "CHyLL\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u79bb\u6563\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5373\u53ef\u5efa\u6a21\u6df7\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u8fde\u7eed\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5efa\u6a21\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u62d3\u5c55\u81f3\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

Unlike prior chatbots limited to either tutoring or affective support, our approach leverages multimodal data-including textual semantics, prosodic speech features, and temporal behavioral trends-to infer engagement, stress, and conceptual understanding. A pilot study with university students demonstrated improved motivation, reduced stress, and moderate academic gains compared to baseline methods.

This work analyzes conspiratorial narratives in Singapore-based Telegram groups, showing that such content is woven into everyday discussions rather than confined to isolated echo chambers. We propose a two-stage computational framework. First, we fine-tune RoBERTa-large to classify messages as conspiratorial or not, achieving an F1-score of 0.866 on 2,000 expert-labeled messages. Second, we build a signed belief graph in which nodes represent messages and edge signs reflect alignment in belief labels, weighted by textual similarity. We introduce a Signed Belief Graph Neural Network (SiBeGNN) that uses a Sign Disentanglement Loss to learn embeddings that separate ideological alignment from stylistic features.\n  Using hierarchical clustering on these embeddings, we identify seven narrative archetypes across 553,648 messages: legal topics, medical concerns, media discussions, finance, contradictions in authority, group moderation, and general chat. SiBeGNN yields stronger clustering quality (cDBI = 8.38) than baseline methods (13.60 to 67.27), supported by 88 percent inter-rater agreement in expert evaluations. Our analysis shows that conspiratorial messages appear not only in clusters focused on skepticism or distrust, but also within routine discussions of finance, law, and everyday matters. These findings challenge common assumptions about online radicalization by demonstrating that conspiratorial discourse operates within ordinary social interaction. The proposed framework advances computational methods for belief-driven discourse analysis and offers applications for stance detection, political communication studies, and content moderation policy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff08RoBERTa\u5206\u7c7b+Signed Belief Graph Neural Network\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u65b0\u52a0\u5761Telegram\u7fa4\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684\u9634\u8c0b\u8bba\u8bdd\u8bed\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5e7f\u6cdb\u6e17\u900f\u4e8e\u65e5\u5e38\u8bdd\u9898\uff08\u5982\u91d1\u878d\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\uff09\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u6781\u7aef\u5316\u56de\u97f3\u5ba4\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e03\u7c7b\u53d9\u4e8b\u539f\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u9634\u8c0b\u8bba\u8bdd\u8bed\u65e5\u76ca\u5d4c\u5165\u6570\u5b57\u901a\u4fe1\u751f\u6001\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u4f20\u64ad\u673a\u5236\u96be\u4ee5\u7814\u7a76\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u5047\u8bbe\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5176\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5b64\u7acb\u56de\u97f3\u5ba4\uff0c\u9700\u5b9e\u8bc1\u68c0\u9a8c\u5176\u5728\u65e5\u5e38\u4ea4\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u5fae\u8c03RoBERTa-large\u8fdb\u884c\u6d88\u606f\u7ea7\u9634\u8c0b\u8bba\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\uff08F1=0.866\uff09\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u6784\u5efa\u5e26\u7b26\u53f7\u4fe1\u5ff5\u56fe\uff08\u8282\u70b9\u4e3a\u6d88\u606f\uff0c\u8fb9\u7b26\u53f7\u8868\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u6743\u91cd\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faSiBeGNN\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7b26\u53f7\u89e3\u8026\u635f\u5931\u4ee5\u5206\u79bb\u610f\u8bc6\u5f62\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u98ce\u683c\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u7528\u5c42\u6b21\u805a\u7c7b\u63d0\u53d6\u53d9\u4e8b\u539f\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u572855\u4e07\u6761\u6d88\u606f\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa7\u7c7b\u53d9\u4e8b\u539f\u578b\uff08\u6cd5\u5f8b\u3001\u533b\u7597\u3001\u5a92\u4f53\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u3001\u6743\u5a01\u77db\u76fe\u3001\u7fa4\u7ec4\u7ba1\u7406\u3001\u65e5\u5e38\u804a\u5929\uff09\uff1bSiBeGNN\u805a\u7c7b\u8d28\u91cf\uff08cDBI=8.38\uff09\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0813.60\u201367.27\uff09\uff1b\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8fbe88%\uff1b\u8bc1\u5b9e\u9634\u8c0b\u8bba\u5185\u5bb9\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5206\u5e03\u4e8e\u975e\u6000\u7591\u7c7b\u65e5\u5e38\u8bdd\u9898\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9634\u8c0b\u8bba\u8bdd\u8bed\u5e76\u975e\u4ec5\u5b58\u4e8e\u6fc0\u8fdb\u6216\u6000\u7591\u6027\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f53\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u6df1\u5ea6\u878d\u5165\u666e\u901a\u793e\u4f1a\u4e92\u52a8\uff1b\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u5ff5\u7684 discourse \u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u652f\u6491\u7acb\u573a\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u653f\u6cbb\u4f20\u64ad\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u5185\u5bb9\u6cbb\u7406\u653f\u7b56\u3002"}}

We systematically construct a dataset of 6,500 videos comprising four types: Authentic-Clean (A-C), Authentic-Spoofed with fake watermarks (A-S), Generated-Watermarked (G-W), and Generated-DeWatermarked (G-DeW). Our benchmark introduces two evaluation tasks: Task-I tests performance on watermark-removed AI videos, while Task-II assesses false alarm rates on authentic videos with fake watermarks. Experiments with ten models spanning specialized AIGC detectors, transformer architectures, and MLLM approaches reveal performance variations of 2-8pp under watermark manipulation. Transformer-based models show consistent moderate dependency (6-8pp), while MLLMs exhibit diverse patterns (2-8pp).

The challenging matching problem between robots and visual detection renders existing methods highly dependent on identity-encoded hardware or delicate tuning algorithms. Overconfident yet erroneous matches may bring about irreversible damage to the localization system. To address this issue, we introduce Mr. Virgil, an end-to-end learning multi-robot visual-range relative localization framework, consisting of a graph neural network for data association between UWB rangings and visual detections, and a differentiable pose graph optimization (PGO) back-end. The graph-based front-end supplies robust matching results, accurate initial position predictions, and credible uncertainty estimates, which are subsequently integrated into the PGO back-end to elevate the accuracy of the final pose estimation. Additionally, a decentralized system is implemented for real-world applications. Experiments spanning varying robot numbers, simulation and real-world, occlusion and non-occlusion conditions showcase the stability and exactitude under various scenes compared to conventional methods.

We introduce AgriRegion, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework designed specifically for high-fidelity, region-aware agricultural advisory. Unlike standard RAG approaches that rely solely on semantic similarity, AgriRegion incorporates a geospatial metadata injection layer and a region-prioritized re-ranking mechanism. By restricting the knowledge base to verified local agricultural extension services and enforcing geo-spatial constraints during retrieval, AgriRegion ensures that the advice regarding planting schedules, pest control, and fertilization is locally accurate. We create a novel benchmark dataset, AgriRegion-Eval, which comprises 160 domain-specific questions across 12 agricultural subfields.

However, 3D graph convolution (3D-GC) methods only focus on local geometry and depth information, making them vulnerable to complex objects and visual ambiguities. To address this, we present THE-Pose, a novel category-level 6D pose estimation framework that leverages a topological prior via surface embedding and hybrid graph fusion. Specifically, we extract consistent and invariant topological features from the image domain, effectively overcoming the limitations inherent in existing 3D-GC based methods. Our Hybrid Graph Fusion (HGF) module adaptively integrates the topological features with point-cloud features, seamlessly bridging 2D image context and 3D geometric structure.

Training of novice pilots is protracted due to the lack of functional and easily accessible training simulators. Moreover, work on parafoil trajectory planning suitable for aiding human training remains limited. To bridge this gap, we study the problem of computing safe trajectories for human-piloted parafoil flight and examine how such trajectories fare against human-generated solutions. For the algorithmic part, we adapt the sampling-based motion planner Stable Sparse RRT (SST) by Li et al., to cope with the problem constraints while minimizing the bank angle (control effort) as a proxy for safety. We then compare the computer-generated solutions with data from human-generated parafoil flight, where the algorithm offers a relative cost improvement of 20\\%-80\\% over the performance of the human pilot. We observe that human pilots tend to, first, close the horizontal distance to the landing area, and then address the vertical gap by spiraling down to the suitable altitude for starting a landing maneuver. The algorithm considered here makes smoother and more gradual descents, arriving at the landing area at the precise altitude necessary for the final approach while maintaining safety constraints. Overall, the study demonstrates the potential of computer-generated guidelines, rather than traditional rules of thumb, which can be integrated into future simulators to train pilots for safer and more cost-effective flights.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4eba\u63a7\u964d\u843d\u4f1e\u98de\u884c\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdbSST\u91c7\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c0f\u6eda\u8f6c\u89d2\uff08\u63a7\u5236\u52aa\u529b\uff09\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u4ee3\u7406\u6307\u6807\uff1b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u98de\u884c\u5458\u5b9e\u9645\u98de\u884c\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u89e3\u5728\u6210\u672c\u4e0a\u6bd4\u4eba\u7c7b\u65b9\u6848\u4f1820%-80%\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0b\u964d\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u7740\u9646\u9ad8\u5ea6\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\uff1b\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6307\u5357\u96c6\u6210\u81f3\u672a\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8df3\u4f1e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u8df3\u4f1e\u4e8b\u6545\u591a\u53d1\u751f\u5728\u4f1e\u7ffc\u64cd\u63a7\u4e0e\u7740\u9646\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u4e3b\u56e0\u662f\u4eba\u4e3a\u5224\u65ad\u5931\u8bef\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u8bad\u7ec3\u5468\u671f\u957f\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u7528\u6613\u7528\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff1b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8f85\u52a9\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u964d\u843d\u4f1e\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u7814\u7a76\u4ecd\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u6539\u8fdbLi\u7b49\u4eba\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Stable Sparse RRT\uff08SST\uff09\u91c7\u6837\u5f0f\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u914d\u964d\u843d\u4f1e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6eda\u8f6c\u89d2\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u4ee3\u8868\u63a7\u5236\u52aa\u529b\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u76f8\u6bd4\u4eba\u7c7b\u98de\u884c\u5458\u5b9e\u9645\u98de\u884c\uff0c\u5728\u6210\u672c\uff08\u5982\u63a7\u5236\u52aa\u529b\uff09\u4e0a\u63d0\u534720%-80%\uff1b\u4eba\u7c7b\u503e\u5411\u5148\u6c34\u5e73\u63a5\u8fd1\u518d\u87ba\u65cb\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u800c\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u62b5\u8fbe\u7740\u9646\u6240\u9700\u9ad8\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8f68\u8ff9\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8d85\u8d8a\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6cd5\u5219\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u672a\u6765\u8df3\u4f1e\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6027\u3002"}}

Studies suggest that this over-reliance on high-resource languages, such as English, hampers LLM performance in mid- and low-resource languages. To mitigate this problem, we propose to (i) optimize the language distribution by training a small proxy model within a domain-reweighing DoGE algorithm that we extend to XDoGE for a multilingual setup, and (ii) rescale the data and train a full-size model with the established language weights either from scratch or within a continual pre-training phase (CPT). We target six languages possessing a variety of geographic and intra- and inter-language-family relations, namely, English and Spanish (high-resource), Portuguese and Catalan (mid-resource), Galician and Basque (low-resource). We experiment with Salamandra-2b, which is a promising model for these languages.

As these companies become increasingly consequential, how do their transparency practices evolve? The 2025 Foundation Model Transparency Index is the third edition of an annual effort to characterize and quantify the transparency of foundation model developers. The 2025 FMTI introduces new indicators related to data acquisition, usage data, and monitoring and evaluates companies like Alibaba, DeepSeek, and xAI for the first time. The 2024 FMTI reported that transparency was improving, but the 2025 FMTI finds this progress has deteriorated: the average score out of 100 fell from 58 in 2024 to 40 in 2025. Companies are most opaque about their training data and training compute as well as the post-deployment usage and impact of their flagship models. In spite of this general trend, IBM stands out as a positive outlier, scoring 95, in contrast to the lowest scorers, xAI and Midjourney, at just 14. The five members of the Frontier Model Forum we score end up in the middle of the Index: we posit that these companies avoid reputational harms from low scores but lack incentives to be transparency leaders.

The imaging noise, artifacts, and the deformation and motion of the heart pose challenges to segmentation algorithms. While existing methods based on convolutional neural networks, Transformers, and space-time memory networks have improved segmentation accuracy, they often struggle with the trade-off between capturing long-range spatiotemporal dependencies and maintaining computational efficiency with fine-grained feature representation. In this paper, we introduce GDKVM, a novel architecture for echocardiography video segmentation. The model employs Linear Key-Value Association (LKVA) to effectively model inter-frame correlations, and introduces Gated Delta Rule (GDR) to efficiently store intermediate memory states. Key-Pixel Feature Fusion (KPFF) module is designed to integrate local and global features at multiple scales, enhancing robustness against boundary blurring and noise interference. We validated GDKVM on two mainstream echocardiography video datasets (CAMUS and EchoNet-Dynamic) and compared it with various state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results show that GDKVM outperforms existing approaches in terms of segmentation accuracy and robustness, while ensuring real-time performance.

We provide a modular and easily registrable toolset, allowing large models to flexibly call various tools to meet different requirements.

In this study, we focus on the most prevalent SARS-CoV-2 lineages associated with the spike protein region and introduce a scalable embedding method that leverages hashing to generate compact, low-dimensional representations of spike sequences. These embeddings are subsequently used to train a variety of machine learning models for supervised lineage classification. We conduct an extensive evaluation comparing our approach with multiple baseline and state-of-the-art biological sequence embedding methods across diverse metrics. Our results demonstrate that the proposed embeddings offer substantial improvements in efficiency, achieving up to 86.4\\% classification accuracy while reducing embedding generation time by as much as 99.81\\%. This highlights the method's potential as a fast, effective, and scalable solution for large-scale viral sequence analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u54c8\u5e0c\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u8868\u5f81SARS-CoV-2\u523a\u7a81\u86cb\u767d\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0886.4%\uff09\u548c\u6781\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff08\u5d4c\u5165\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1199.81%\uff09\u7684\u8c31\u7cfb\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d1\u80b2\u6811\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u767e\u4e07\u7ea7\u5e8f\u5217\uff1b\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u5219\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u591a\u5e8f\u5217\u6bd4\u5bf9\u6216\u5b58\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u3001\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u9488\u5bf9\u4e3b\u6d41SARS-CoV-2\u8c31\u7cfb\u7684\u523a\u7a81\u86cb\u767d\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u54c8\u5e0c\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4f4e\u7ef4\u7d27\u51d1\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\u5f0f\u8c31\u7cfb\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u9879\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u53ca\u524d\u6cbf\u751f\u7269\u5e8f\u5217\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe86.4%\uff0c\u5d4c\u5165\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u6700\u591a\u964d\u4f4e99.81%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u54c8\u5e0c\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u75c5\u6bd2\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u6d4b\u3002"}}

Causal reasoning demands multihop composition and strict conjunctive control, and reliance on spurious lexical relations of the input could provide misleading results. We hypothesize that, due to their ability to project the input into a latent space, encoder and encoder decoder architectures are better suited for said multihop conjunctive reasoning versus decoder only models. To do this, we compare fine-tuned versions of all the aforementioned architectures with zero and few shot ICL in both natural language and non natural language scenarios. We find that ICL alone is insufficient for reliable causal reasoning, often overfocusing on irrelevant input features. In particular, decoder only models are noticeably brittle to distributional shifts, while finetuned encoder and encoder decoder models can generalize more robustly across our tests, including the non natural language split. Both architectures are only matched or surpassed by decoder only architectures at large scales. We conclude by noting that for cost effective, short horizon robust causal reasoning, encoder or encoder decoder architectures with targeted finetuning are preferable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ICL\uff09\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0ICL\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5c24\u5176decoder-only\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u654f\u611f\uff1b\u800c\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u7684encoder\u548cencoder-decoder\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0a\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6210\u672c\u654f\u611f\u3001\u77ed\u671f horizon\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u9700\u8981\u591a\u8df3\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0e\u4e25\u683c\u5408\u53d6\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709ICL\u65b9\u6cd5\u6613\u53d7\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\u865a\u5047\u8bcd\u6c47\u5173\u7cfb\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684encoder\u3001encoder-decoder\u548cdecoder-only\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u4e0e\u5c11\u6837\u672cICL\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e\u975e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "ICL\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0cdecoder-only\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8106\u5f31\uff1b\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684encoder\u4e0eencoder-decoder\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5404\u7c7b\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08\u542b\u975e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5212\u5206\uff09\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u5927\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u88abdecoder-only\u6a21\u578b\u8ffd\u5e73\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6210\u672c\u654f\u611f\u3001\u77ed\u671f\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63a8\u8350\u91c7\u7528\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\u7684encoder\u6216encoder-decoder\u67b6\u6784\u3002"}}

Frontier video models can enable generation of realistic observations and environment interactions in a scalable and general manner. However, the use of video models in robotics has been limited primarily to in-distribution evaluations, i.e., scenarios that are similar to ones used to train the policy or fine-tune the base video model. In this report, we demonstrate that video models can be used for the entire spectrum of policy evaluation use cases in robotics: from assessing nominal performance to out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, and probing physical and semantic safety. We introduce a generative evaluation system built upon a frontier video foundation model (Veo). The system is optimized to support robot action conditioning and multi-view consistency, while integrating generative image-editing and multi-view completion to synthesize realistic variations of real-world scenes along multiple axes of generalization. We demonstrate that the system preserves the base capabilities of the video model to enable accurate simulation of scenes that have been edited to include novel interaction objects, novel visual backgrounds, and novel distractor objects. This fidelity enables accurately predicting the relative performance of different policies in both nominal and OOD conditions, determining the relative impact of different axes of generalization on policy performance, and performing red teaming of policies to expose behaviors that violate physical or semantic safety constraints. We validate these capabilities through 1600+ real-world evaluations of eight Gemini Robotics policy checkpoints and five tasks for a bimanual manipulator.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u524d\u6cbf\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08Veo\uff09\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u540d\u4e49\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5916\uff08OOD\uff09\u6cdb\u5316\u53ca\u7269\u7406/\u8bed\u4e49\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u4e0e\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u8865\u5168\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u573a\u666f\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u57281600+\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9886\u57df\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u652f\u6301\u5168\u8c31\u7cfb\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08\u542bOOD\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\uff09\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8eVeo\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u52a8\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b\u96c6\u6210\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u4e0e\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u8865\u5168\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4ee5\u5408\u6210\u6db5\u76d6\u65b0\u4ea4\u4e92\u7269\u4f53\u3001\u65b0\u80cc\u666f\u3001\u65b0\u5e72\u6270\u7269\u7b49\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6a21\u62df\u7f16\u8f91\u540e\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u540d\u4e49\u4e0eOOD\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u5404\u6cdb\u5316\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u8fdb\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u7ea2\u961f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ee5\u66b4\u9732\u8fdd\u53cd\u7269\u7406\u6216\u8bed\u4e49\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\u7ecf1600+\u6b21\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8986\u76d68\u4e2aGemini Robotics\u7b56\u7565\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u4e0e5\u4e2a\u53cc\u81c2\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u524d\u6cbf\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u7ecf\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u540e\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5927\u3001\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u652f\u6491\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5168\u8c31\u7cfb\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728OOD\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u9762\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

In this paper, we argue that the i.i.d. setting can and should be reframed in terms of exchangeability, a strictly more general symmetry principle. We present the implications of this reframing, alongside two core arguments: (1) a conceptual argument, based on extending the dependency of experimental causal inference on exchangeability to causal discovery; and (2) an empirical argument, showing that many existing i.i.d. causal-discovery methods are predicated on exchangeability assumptions, and that the sole extensive widely-used real-world \"i.i.d.\" benchmark (the T\u00fcbingen dataset) consists mainly of exchangeable (and not i.i.d.) examples. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel synthetic dataset that enforces only the exchangeability assumption, without imposing the stronger i.i.d. assumption. We show that our exchangeable synthetic dataset mirrors the statistical structure of the real-world \"i.i.d.\" dataset more closely than all other i.i.d. synthetic datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate the predictive capability of this dataset by proposing a neural-network-based causal-discovery algorithm trained exclusively on our synthetic dataset, and which performs similarly to other state-of-the-art i.i.d. methods on the real-world benchmark.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\uff08i.i.d.\uff09\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u8303\u5f0f\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u66f4\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u53ef\u4ea4\u6362\u6027\uff08exchangeability\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bba\u8bc1\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u5408\u7406\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u6784\u5efa\u4ec5\u6ee1\u8db3\u53ef\u4ea4\u6362\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4e14\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1\u771f\u5b9e\u2018i.i.d.\u2019\u57fa\u51c6\uff08\u5982T\u00fcbingen\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff09\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ec5\u5728\u6b64\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u5f53\u524dSOTA i.i.d. \u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728i.i.d.\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e24\u79cd\u5272\u88c2\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0b\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u8bb8\u591a\u6240\u8c13\u2018i.i.d.\u2019\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982T\u00fcbingen\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff09\u5b9e\u9645\u4ec5\u6ee1\u8db3\u66f4\u5f31\u7684\u53ef\u4ea4\u6362\u6027\uff1b\u4f5c\u8005\u6307\u51fa\u53ef\u4ea4\u6362\u6027\u662f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4e5f\u5e94\u6210\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u8bba\u8bc1\u53ef\u4ea4\u6362\u6027\u4f18\u4e8ei.i.d.\u4f5c\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u5047\u8bbe\uff1b\u6784\u9020\u9996\u4e2a\u663e\u5f0f\u4ec5\u6ee1\u8db3\u53ef\u4ea4\u6362\u6027\u3001\u4e0d\u5f3a\u5236i.i.d.\u7684\u5408\u6210\u56e0\u679c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\u4e3b\u6d41i.i.d.\u65b9\u6cd5\u9690\u542b\u4f9d\u8d56\u53ef\u4ea4\u6362\u6027\uff1bT\u00fcbingen\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e3b\u4f53\u4e3a\u53ef\u4ea4\u6362\u800c\u975e\u4e25\u683ci.i.d.\uff1b\u6240\u63d0\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709i.i.d.\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1T\u00fcbingen\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\u5728T\u00fcbingen\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8eSOTA i.i.d.\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u4ea4\u6362\u6027\u662f\u6bd4i.i.d.\u66f4\u81ea\u7136\u3001\u66f4\u666e\u9002\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u73b0\u5b9e\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u5efa\u6a21\u524d\u63d0\uff1b\u4ee5\u53ef\u4ea4\u6362\u6027\u4e3a\u57fa\u77f3\u53ef\u63a8\u52a8\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7edf\u4e00\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

Yet, when extended to subjective and open-ended domains such as role play, existing reward models exhibit severe degradation, struggling to capture nuanced and persona-grounded human judgments. To address this gap, we introduce RoleRMBench, the first systematic benchmark for reward modeling in role-playing dialogue, covering seven fine-grained capabilities from narrative management to role consistency and engagement. Evaluation on RoleRMBench reveals large and consistent gaps between general-purpose reward models and human judgment, particularly in narrative and stylistic dimensions. We further propose RoleRM, a reward model trained with Continuous Implicit Preferences (CIP), which reformulates subjective evaluation as continuous consistent pairwise supervision under multiple structuring strategies. Comprehensive experiments show that RoleRM surpasses strong open- and closed-source reward models by over 24% on average, demonstrating substantial gains in narrative coherence and stylistic fidelity.

Utilising a pool of operators instead of a single operator to handle move operations within a neighbourhood remains promising, but an optimum or near optimum sequence of operators necessitates further investigation.

Although numerous works are done around this issue for single objective optimisation, multi-objective cases have not much been touched in this regard.

Long-LRM notably scales this paradigm to 32 input images at $950\\times540$ resolution, achieving 360\u00b0 scene-level reconstruction in a single forward pass. However, directly predicting millions of Gaussian parameters at once remains highly error-sensitive: small inaccuracies in positions or other attributes lead to noticeable blurring, particularly in fine structures such as text. In parallel, implicit representation methods such as LVSM and LaCT have demonstrated significantly higher rendering fidelity by compressing scene information into model weights rather than explicit Gaussians, and decoding RGB frames using the full transformer or TTT backbone. However, this computationally intensive decompression process for every rendered frame makes real-time rendering infeasible. These observations raise key questions: Is the deep, sequential \"decompression\" process necessary? Can we retain the benefits of implicit representations while enabling real-time performance? We address these questions with Long-LRM++, a model that adopts a semi-explicit scene representation combined with a lightweight decoder. Long-LRM++ matches the rendering quality of LaCT on DL3DV while achieving real-time 14 FPS rendering on an A100 GPU, overcoming the speed limitations of prior implicit methods. Our design also scales to 64 input views at the $950\\times540$ resolution, demonstrating strong generalization to increased input lengths. Additionally, Long-LRM++ delivers superior novel-view depth prediction on ScanNetv2 compared to direct depth rendering from Gaussians.

For such future deployments, safety requirements should be addressed, where the primary such are avoidance of vehicle collisions and substantial mitigating of harm when collisions are unavoidable.

In light of this, we investigate how Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) can be leveraged to improve safety in multi-vehicle-following scenarios involving emergency braking. Specifically, we investigate how DRL with vehicle-to-vehicle communication can be used to ethically select an emergency breaking profile in scenarios where overall, or collective, three-vehicle harm reduction or collision avoidance shall be obtained instead of single-vehicle such.

Although recent large language models (LLMs) show promise for data augmentation, an integrated framework that simultaneously achieves directional control of generation, domain alignment, and quality control has not yet been fully established. To address these challenges, we propose a Cluster-conditioned Interpolative and Extrapolative framework for Geometry-Aware and Domain-aligned data augmentation (CIEGAD), which systematically complements both in-distribution and out-of-distribution semantically uncovered regions. CIEGAD constructs domain profiles through cluster conditioning, allocates generation with a hierarchical frequency-geometric allocation integrating class frequency and geometric indicators, and finely controls generation directions via the coexistence of interpolative and extrapolative synthesis. It further performs quality control through geometry-constrained filtering combined with an LLM-as-a-Judge mechanism. Experiments on multiple classification tasks demonstrate that CIEGAD effectively extends the periphery of real-world data distributions while maintaining high alignment between generated and real-world data as well as semantic diversity. In particular, for long-tailed and multi-class classification tasks, CIEGAD consistently improves F1 and recall, validating the triple harmony of distributional consistency, diversity, and quality.

However, existing work often neglects to incorporate state-of-the-art robust teachers. Through extensive analysis, we find that stronger teachers do not necessarily yield more robust students-a phenomenon known as robust saturation. While typically attributed to capacity gaps, we show that such explanations are incomplete. Instead, we identify adversarial transferability-the fraction of student-crafted adversarial examples that remain effective against the teacher-as a key factor in successful robustness transfer. Based on this insight, we propose Sample-wise Adaptive Adversarial Distillation (SAAD), which reweights training examples by their measured transferability without incurring additional computational cost.

Namely, we seek to stabilize an equilateral polygonal formation on closed planar differentiable curves after a path sweep. The task of finding an inscribed regular polygon centered at the point of interest is solved via a randomized multi-start Newton-Like algorithm for which one is able to ascertain the existence of a minimizer. Then we design a continuous feedback law that guarantees convergence to, and sufficient sweeping of the curve, followed by convergence to the desired formation vertices while ensuring inter-agent avoidance. The proposed approach is validated through numerical simulations for different classes of curves and different rigid formations.

Using the Serbian language as a case, this study examines the structural, historical, and sociotechnical factors shaping language technology development for low resource languages in the AI age. Drawing on semi structured interviews with ten scholars and practitioners, including linguists, digital humanists, and AI developers, it traces challenges rooted in historical destruction of Serbian textual heritage, intensified by contemporary issues that drive reductive, engineering first approaches prioritizing functionality over linguistic nuance. These include superficial transliteration, reliance on English-trained models, data bias, and dataset curation lacking cultural specificity. To address these challenges, the study proposes Data Care, a framework grounded in CARE principles (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics), that reframes bias mitigation from a post hoc technical fix to an integral component of corpus design, annotation, and governance, and positions Data Care as a replicable model for building inclusive, sustainable, and culturally grounded language technologies in contexts where traditional LLM development reproduces existing power imbalances and cultural blind spots.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4ee5\u585e\u5c14\u7ef4\u4e9a\u8bed\u4e3a\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u5728AI\u65f6\u4ee3\u8bed\u8a00\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u3001\u5386\u53f2\u6027\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u6280\u672f\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eCARE\u539f\u5219\u7684'Data Care'\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u6587\u5316\u654f\u611f\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u65b9\u5f0f\u91cd\u6784\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u6cbb\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982\u585e\u5c14\u7ef4\u4e9a\u8bed\uff09\u4e2d\u56e0\u4f9d\u8d56\u82f1\u8bed\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6570\u636e\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6587\u5316\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5386\u53f2\u6587\u672c\u9057\u4ea7\u635f\u6bc1\u4e0e\u5f53\u4ee3\u5de5\u7a0b\u5316\u503e\u5411\u52a0\u5267\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6280\u672f\u5931\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e10\u4f4d\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u5bb6\u3001\u6570\u5b57\u4eba\u6587\u5b66\u8005\u548cAI\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7684\u534a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bbf\u8c08\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u5386\u53f2\u80cc\u666f\u3001\u6570\u636e\u504f\u89c1\u3001\u8f6c\u5199\u7b80\u5316\u53ca\u82f1\u8bed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8d28\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa'Data Care'\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5f71\u54cd\u585e\u5c14\u7ef4\u4e9a\u8bed\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u591a\u91cd\u6311\u6218\uff08\u5982\u6587\u672c\u9057\u4ea7\u7834\u574f\u3001\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6587\u5316\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u3001\u5de5\u7a0b\u4f18\u5148\u8303\u5f0f\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4ee5CARE\u539f\u5219\uff08\u96c6\u4f53\u53d7\u76ca\u3001\u63a7\u5236\u6743\u3001\u8d23\u4efb\u3001\u4f26\u7406\uff09\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u7684Data Care\u5b9e\u8df5\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "Data Care\u5c06\u504f\u89c1\u7f13\u89e3\u4ece\u4e8b\u540e\u6280\u672f\u4fee\u8865\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u8bed\u6599\u5efa\u8bbe\u4e0e\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u5185\u5728\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5728\u4f20\u7edfLLM\u5f00\u53d1\u6613\u590d\u5236\u6743\u529b\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u5bb9\u3001\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u3001\u6587\u5316\u624e\u6839\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

While forward reasoning approaches like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) have shown success in structured problem-solving, they frequently fail to systematically identify and recover omitted information. In this paper, we explore the potential of reverse thinking methodologies to enhance LLMs' performance on missing information detection tasks. Drawing inspiration from recent work on backward reasoning, we propose a novel framework that guides LLMs through reverse thinking to identify necessary conditions and pinpoint missing elements. Our approach transforms the challenging task of missing information identification into a more manageable backward reasoning problem, significantly improving model accuracy.

Unlike existing image editing datasets that focus on static appearance changes or contain only sparse, low-quality motion edits, MotionEdit provides high-fidelity image pairs depicting realistic motion transformations extracted and verified from continuous videos. This new task is not only scientifically challenging but also practically significant, powering downstream applications such as frame-controlled video synthesis and animation.\n  To evaluate model performance on the novel task, we introduce MotionEdit-Bench, a benchmark that challenges models on motion-centric edits and measures model performance with generative, discriminative, and preference-based metrics. Benchmark results reveal that motion editing remains highly challenging for existing state-of-the-art diffusion-based editing models. To address this gap, we propose MotionNFT (Motion-guided Negative-aware Fine Tuning), a post-training framework that computes motion alignment rewards based on how well the motion flow between input and model-edited images matches the ground-truth motion, guiding models toward accurate motion transformations.

Analytical models lose fidelity under these nonlinear and nonstationary effects, while standard data-driven methods such as deep neural networks and Gaussian processes cannot represent the diverse residual behaviors that arise across different operating conditions. We propose a regime-conditioned diffusion framework that models the full distribution of residual forces using a conditional diffusion process and a lightweight temporal encoder.

Regulations such as the European AI Act require identifying and mitigating biases against protected groups in data, with the ultimate goal of preventing unfair model outputs. However, practical guidance and operationalization are lacking. We propose a comprehensive data bias detection and mitigation pipeline comprising four components that address two data bias types, namely representation bias and (explicit) stereotypes for a configurable sensitive attribute. First, we leverage LLM-generated word lists created based on quality criteria to detect relevant group labels. Second, representation bias is quantified using the Demographic Representation Score. Third, we detect and mitigate stereotypes using sociolinguistically informed filtering. Finally, we compensate representation bias through Grammar- and Context-Aware Counterfactual Data Augmentation. We conduct a two-fold evaluation using the examples of gender, religion and age. First, the effectiveness of each individual component on data debiasing is evaluated through human validation and baseline comparison. The findings demonstrate that we successfully reduce representation bias and (explicit) stereotypes in a text dataset. Second, the effect of data debiasing on model bias reduction is evaluated by bias benchmarking of several models (0.6B-8B parameters), fine-tuned on the debiased text dataset. This evaluation reveals that LLMs fine-tuned on debiased data do not consistently show improved performance on bias benchmarks, exposing critical gaps in current evaluation methodologies and highlighting the need for targeted data manipulation to address manifested model bias.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u9488\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u8868\u5f81\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u7f13\u89e3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u751f\u6210\u8bcd\u8868\u7684\u654f\u611f\u7fa4\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u8868\u5f81\u5f97\u5206\u91cf\u5316\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u8fc7\u6ee4\u53bb\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u3001\u8bed\u6cd5\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u8865\u507f\u8868\u5f81\u504f\u5dee\uff1b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6d41\u7a0b\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u504f\u5dee\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "motivation": "\u6cd5\u89c4\uff08\u5982\u6b27\u76dfAI\u6cd5\u6848\uff09\u8981\u6c42\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u7f13\u89e3\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5bf9\u53d7\u4fdd\u62a4\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u56db\u6b65\u6570\u636e\u504f\u5dee\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u7f13\u89e3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a1\uff09\u5229\u7528LLM\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u654f\u611f\u7fa4\u4f53\u8bcd\u8868\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u76f8\u5173\u6807\u7b7e\uff1b2\uff09\u7528\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u8868\u5f81\u5f97\u5206\uff08Demographic Representation Score\uff09\u91cf\u5316\u8868\u5f81\u504f\u5dee\uff1b3\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u793e\u4f1a\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u8fc7\u6ee4\u65b9\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e76\u7f13\u89e3\u663e\u5f0f\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\uff1b4\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u6cd5\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u8865\u507f\u8868\u5f81\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u5728\u6027\u522b\u3001\u5b97\u6559\u3001\u5e74\u9f84\u4e09\u4e2a\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0a\u5f00\u5c55\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5404\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7ecf\u4eba\u5de5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u57fa\u7ebf\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\uff1b\u4f46\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u53bb\u504f\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c030.6B\u20138B\u53c2\u6570LLM\u540e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u504f\u5dee\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u672a\u5448\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u6539\u5584\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6d41\u7a0b\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u53bb\u504f\uff0c\u4f46\u6570\u636e\u53bb\u504f\u672a\u5fc5\u76f4\u63a5\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u504f\u5dee\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u64cd\u63a7\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u5df2\u663e\u73b0\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u5dee\u3002"}}

We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees, including state stability, bounded approximation errors, and universal approximation.

However, recent progress has primarily focused on low-level visual consistency across shots, neglecting how transitions are designed and how cinematographic language contributes to coherent narrative expression. This often leads to mere sequential shot changes without intentional film-editing patterns. To address this limitation, we propose ShotDirector, an efficient framework that integrates parameter-level camera control and hierarchical editing-pattern-aware prompting. Specifically, we adopt a camera control module that incorporates 6-DoF poses and intrinsic settings to enable precise camera information injection. In addition, a shot-aware mask mechanism is employed to introduce hierarchical prompts aware of professional editing patterns, allowing fine-grained control over shot content. Through this design, our framework effectively combines parameter-level conditions with high-level semantic guidance, achieving film-like controllable shot transitions. To facilitate training and evaluation, we construct ShotWeaver40K, a dataset that captures the priors of film-like editing patterns, and develop a set of evaluation metrics for controllable multi-shot video generation.

While recent generative models can synthesize useful data for individual tasks, they do not exploit the compositional structure of robotic domains and struggle to generalize to unseen task combinations. We propose a semantic compositional diffusion transformer that factorizes transitions into robot-, object-, obstacle-, and objective-specific components and learns their interactions through attention. Once trained on a limited subset of tasks, we show that our model can zero-shot generate high-quality transitions from which we can learn control policies for unseen task combinations. Then, we introduce an iterative self-improvement procedure in which synthetic data is validated via offline reinforcement learning and incorporated into subsequent training rounds.

Pure low-rank tensor completion, as a classical data recovery method, falls short in handling non-random missingness, both methodologically and theoretically. Hankel-structured tensor completion models provide a feasible approach for recovering multidimensional time series with non-random missing patterns. However, most Hankel-based multidimensional data recovery methods both suffer from unclear sources of Hankel tensor low-rankness and lack an exact recovery theory for non-random missing data. To address these issues, we propose the temporal isometric delay-embedding transform, which constructs a Hankel tensor whose low-rankness is naturally induced by the smoothness and periodicity of the underlying time series. Leveraging this property, we develop the \\textit{Low-Rank Tensor Completion with Temporal Isometric Delay-embedding Transform} (LRTC-TIDT) model, which characterizes the low-rank structure under the \\textit{Tensor Singular Value Decomposition} (t-SVD) framework. Once the prescribed non-random sampling conditions and mild incoherence assumptions are satisfied, the proposed LRTC-TIDT model achieves exact recovery, as confirmed by simulation experiments under various non-random missing patterns. Furthermore, LRTC-TIDT consistently outperforms existing tensor-based methods across multiple real-world tasks, including network flow reconstruction, urban traffic estimation, and temperature field prediction.

This advancement is also inseparable from the oversight automated by reliable verifiers. However, current outcome-based verifiers (OVs) are unable to inspect the unreliable intermediate steps in the long reasoning chains of thought (CoTs). Meanwhile, current process-based verifiers (PVs) have difficulties in reliably detecting errors in the complex long CoTs, limited by the scarcity of high-quality annotations due to the prohibitive costs of human annotations. Therefore, we propose the \\textbf{O}utcome-based \\textbf{P}rocess \\textbf{V}erifier (OPV), which verifies the rationale process of summarized outcomes from long CoTs to achieve both accurate and efficient verification and enable large-scale annotation. To empower the proposed verifier, we adopt an iterative active learning framework with expert annotations to progressively improve the verification capability of OPV with fewer annotation costs. Specifically, in each iteration, the most uncertain cases of the current best OPV are annotated and then subsequently used to train a new OPV through Rejection Fine-Tuning (RFT) and RLVR for the next round. Extensive experiments demonstrate OPV's superior performance and broad applicability. It achieves new state-of-the-art results on our held-out \\textsc{\\thisbench}, outperforming much larger open-source models such as Qwen3-Max-Preview with an F1 score of 83.1 compared to 76.3.

In this paper, we propose a novel interpretability framework to systematically analyze the internal mechanisms of VLMs, focusing on the functional roles of attention heads in multimodal reasoning. To this end, we introduce CogVision, a dataset that decomposes complex multimodal questions into step-by-step subquestions designed to simulate human reasoning through a chain-of-thought paradigm, with each subquestion associated with specific receptive or cognitive functions such as high-level visual reception and inference. Using a probing-based methodology, we identify attention heads that specialize in these functions and characterize them as functional heads. Our analysis across diverse VLM families reveals that these functional heads are universally sparse, vary in number and distribution across functions, and mediate interactions and hierarchical organization. Furthermore, intervention experiments demonstrate their critical role in multimodal reasoning: removing functional heads leads to performance degradation, while emphasizing them enhances accuracy.

We propose a reinforcement learning approach enabling a drone to navigate unknown three-dimensional tubes without any prior knowledge of their geometry, relying solely on local observations from LiDAR and a conditional visual detection of the tube center. In contrast, the Pure Pursuit algorithm, used as a deterministic baseline, benefits from explicit access to the centerline, creating an information asymmetry designed to assess the ability of RL to compensate for the absence of a geometric model. The agent is trained through a progressive Curriculum Learning strategy that gradually exposes it to increasingly curved geometries, where the tube center frequently disappears from the visual field. A turning-negotiation mechanism, based on the combination of direct visibility, directional memory, and LiDAR symmetry cues, proves essential for ensuring stable navigation under such partial observability conditions. Experiments show that the PPO policy acquires robust and generalizable behavior, consistently outperforming the deterministic controller despite its limited access to geometric information. Validation in a high-fidelity 3D environment further confirms the transferability of the learned behavior to a continuous physical dynamics.\n  The proposed approach thus provides a complete framework for autonomous navigation in unknown tubular environments and opens perspectives for industrial, underground, or medical applications where progressing through narrow and weakly perceptive conduits represents a central challenge.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08PPO\uff09\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5bfc\u822a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u4e09\u7ef4\u7ba1\u72b6\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4ec5\u4f9d\u9760LiDAR\u548c\u7ba1\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u8fdb\u884c\u7a33\u5b9a\u98de\u884c\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5148\u9a8c\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8f6c\u5411\u534f\u5546\u673a\u5236\u5e94\u5bf9\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7ebf\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u7eaf\u8ffd\u8e2a\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u72ed\u7a84\u3001\u5c01\u95ed\u7ba1\u72b6\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u56e0\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u58c1\u9762\u90bb\u8fd1\u53ca\u611f\u77e5\u53d7\u9650\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9762\u5411\u5de5\u4e1a\u3001\u5730\u4e0b\u6216\u533b\u7597\u7b49\u5f31\u611f\u77e5\u7a84\u901a\u9053\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528PPO\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8f93\u5165\u4e3aLiDAR\u5c40\u90e8\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0e\u6761\u4ef6\u5f0f\u7ba1\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u4ece\u76f4\u7ba1\u5230\u9ad8\u66f2\u7387\u7ba1\uff09\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u878d\u5408\u76f4\u63a5\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u3001\u65b9\u5411\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0eLiDAR\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u8f6c\u5411\u534f\u5546\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6d88\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u4ee5Pure Pursuit\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5177\u5907\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7ebf\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u57fa\u7ebf\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u51fa\u7684PPO\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8ePure Pursuit\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f3D\u73af\u5883\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u81f3\u8fde\u7eed\u7269\u7406\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9762\u5411\u672a\u77e5\u7ba1\u72b6\u73af\u5883\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u5b8c\u6574\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eRL\u53ef\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u4fe1\u606f\u53d7\u9650\u4e0b\u66ff\u4ee3\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5f31\u611f\u77e5\u7a84\u901a\u9053\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

FedDG methods aggregate the parameters of locally trained client models to form a global model that generalizes to unseen clients while preserving data privacy. While improving the generalization capability of the global model, many existing approaches in FedDG jeopardize privacy by sharing statistics of client data between themselves. Our solution addresses this problem by contributing new ways to perform local client training and model aggregation. To improve local client training, we enforce (domain) invariance across local models with the help of a novel technique, \\textbf{latent space inversion}, which enables better client privacy.

We present TRIDENT (Transcription and Routing Intelligence for Dispatcher-Empowered National Triage), a three-layer dispatcher-support architecture designed to structure emergency call inputs for human application of established triage protocols (the ESI for routine operations and START for mass casualty events), even when automatic speech recognition fails.\n  The system combines Caribbean-accent-tuned ASR, local entity extraction via large language models, and bio-acoustic distress detection to provide dispatchers with three complementary signals: transcription confidence, structured clinical entities, and vocal stress indicators. Our key insight is that low ASR confidence, rather than representing system failure, serves as a valuable queue prioritization signal -- particularly when combined with elevated vocal distress markers indicating a caller in crisis whose speech may have shifted toward basilectal registers. A complementary insight drives the entity extraction layer: trained responders and composed bystanders may report life-threatening emergencies without elevated vocal stress, requiring semantic analysis to capture clinical indicators that paralinguistic features miss.\n  We describe the architectural design, theoretical grounding in psycholinguistic research on stress-induced code-switching, and deployment considerations for offline operation during disaster scenarios.

However, their practical development is severely hindered by the substantial training overhead. We recognize two key issues that contribute to the overhead: (1) the quadratic computational burden from processing long-horizon historical observations as massive sequences of tokens, and (2) the exploration-efficiency trade-off in DAgger, i.e., a data aggregation process of collecting agent-explored trajectories. While more exploration yields effective error-recovery trajectories for handling test-time distribution shifts, it comes at the cost of longer trajectory lengths for both training and inference. To address these challenges, we propose Efficient-VLN, a training-efficient VLN model. Specifically, to mitigate the token processing burden, we design two efficient memory mechanisms: a progressive memory that dynamically allocates more tokens to recent observations, and a learnable recursive memory that utilizes the key-value cache of learnable tokens as the memory state.

Integrating these signals is challenging due to their fundamental frequency and informational disparities. In this work, we propose ImplicitRDP, a unified end-to-end visual-force diffusion policy that integrates visual planning and reactive force control within a single network. We introduce Structural Slow-Fast Learning, a mechanism utilizing causal attention to simultaneously process asynchronous visual and force tokens, allowing the policy to perform closed-loop adjustments at the force frequency while maintaining the temporal coherence of action chunks. Furthermore, to mitigate modality collapse where end-to-end models fail to adjust the weights across different modalities, we propose Virtual-target-based Representation Regularization. This auxiliary objective maps force feedback into the same space as the action, providing a stronger, physics-grounded learning signal than raw force prediction. Extensive experiments on contact-rich tasks demonstrate that ImplicitRDP significantly outperforms both vision-only and hierarchical baselines, achieving superior reactivity and success rates with a streamlined training pipeline.

Traditional approaches primarily rely on historical time series data to predict the future values. However, in practical scenarios, this is often insufficient for accurate predictions due to the limited information available. To address this challenge, multimodal time series forecasting methods which incorporate additional data modalities, mainly text data, alongside time series data have been explored. In this work, we introduce the Adaptive Information Routing (AIR) framework, a novel approach for multimodal time series forecasting. Unlike existing methods that treat text data on par with time series data as interchangeable auxiliary features for forecasting, AIR leverages text information to dynamically guide the time series model by controlling how and to what extent multivariate time series information should be combined. We also present a text-refinement pipeline that employs a large language model to convert raw text data into a form suitable for multimodal forecasting, and we introduce a benchmark that facilitates multimodal forecasting experiments based on this pipeline. Experiment results with the real world market data such as crude oil price and exchange rates demonstrate that AIR effectively modulates the behavior of the time series model using textual inputs, significantly enhancing forecasting accuracy in various time series forecasting tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4fe1\u606f\u8def\u7531\uff08AIR\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u52a8\u6001\u5f15\u5bfc\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5386\u53f2\u65f6\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u56e0\u4fe1\u606f\u6709\u9650\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f15\u5165\u6587\u672c\u7b49\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAIR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u63a7\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e0e\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6587\u672c\u7cbe\u70bc\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u914d\u5957\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u539f\u6cb9\u4ef7\u683c\u3001\u6c47\u7387\u7b49\u771f\u5b9e\u91d1\u878d\u5e02\u573a\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAIR\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\u8c03\u8282\u65f6\u5e8f\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u79cd\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "AIR\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u6587\u672c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u800c\u975e\u7b80\u5355\u8f85\u52a9\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

This advancement is also inseparable from the oversight automated by reliable verifiers. However, current outcome-based verifiers (OVs) are unable to inspect the unreliable intermediate steps in the long reasoning chains of thought (CoTs). Meanwhile, current process-based verifiers (PVs) have difficulties in reliably detecting errors in the complex long CoTs, limited by the scarcity of high-quality annotations due to the prohibitive costs of human annotations. Therefore, we propose the Outcome-based Process Verifier (OPV), which verifies the rationale process of summarized outcomes from long CoTs to achieve both accurate and efficient verification and enable large-scale annotation. To empower the proposed verifier, we adopt an iterative active learning framework with expert annotations to progressively improve the verification capability of OPV with fewer annotation costs. Specifically, in each iteration, the most uncertain cases of the current best OPV are annotated and then subsequently used to train a new OPV through Rejection Fine-Tuning (RFT) and RLVR for the next round. Extensive experiments demonstrate OPV's superior performance and broad applicability.

While collaborative perception mitigates the limitations of single-agent perception through information sharing, it encounters a fundamental communication-performance trade-off. Existing communication-efficient approaches typically assume MB-level data transmission per collaboration, which may fail due to practical network constraints. To address these issues, we propose InfoCom, an information-aware framework establishing the pioneering theoretical foundation for communication-efficient collaborative perception via extended Information Bottleneck principles. Departing from mainstream feature manipulation, InfoCom introduces a novel information purification paradigm that theoretically optimizes the extraction of minimal sufficient task-critical information under Information Bottleneck constraints. Its core innovations include: i) An Information-Aware Encoding condensing features into minimal messages while preserving perception-relevant information; ii) A Sparse Mask Generation identifying spatial cues with negligible communication cost; and iii) A Multi-Scale Decoding that progressively recovers perceptual information through mask-guided mechanisms rather than simple feature reconstruction. Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that InfoCom achieves near-lossless perception while reducing communication overhead from megabyte to kilobyte-scale, representing 440-fold and 90-fold reductions per agent compared to Where2comm and ERMVP, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faInfoCom\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u606f\u51c0\u5316\u8303\u5f0f\u5b9e\u73b0\u901a\u4fe1\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u534f\u540c\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\uff08\u8fbe440\u500d\uff09\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8fd1\u4e4e\u65e0\u635f\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u534f\u540c\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff08MB\u7ea7\uff09\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u9645\u7f51\u7edc\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b\u9700\u5728\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u5c55\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6InfoCom\uff0c\u5305\u542b\uff1ai) \u4fe1\u606f\u611f\u77e5\u7f16\u7801\uff08\u538b\u7f29\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u4efb\u52a1\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\uff1bii) \u7a00\u758f\u63a9\u7801\u751f\u6210\uff08\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u8bc6\u522b\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ebf\u7d22\uff09\uff1biii) \u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u89e3\u7801\uff08\u63a9\u7801\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e0b\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u611f\u77e5\u4fe1\u606f\u6062\u590d\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cInfoCom\u5c06\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u4eceMB\u7ea7\u964d\u81f3KB\u7ea7\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4Where2comm\u548cERMVP\u5206\u522b\u964d\u4f4e440\u500d\u548c90\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd1\u65e0\u635f\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "InfoCom\u9996\u6b21\u4e3a\u901a\u4fe1\u9ad8\u6548\u534f\u540c\u611f\u77e5\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5176\u4fe1\u606f\u51c0\u5316\u8303\u5f0f\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7279\u5f81\u64cd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8f66\u8f7d\u534f\u540c\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u6027\u3002"}}

Under review for IEEE TPAMI", "summary": "Multi-output Gaussian process (MGP) models have attracted significant attention for their flexibility and uncertainty-quantification capabilities, and have been widely adopted in multi-source transfer learning scenarios due to their ability to capture inter-task correlations. However, they still face several challenges in transfer learning. First, the input spaces of the source and target domains are often heterogeneous, which makes direct knowledge transfer difficult. Second, potential prior knowledge and physical information are typically ignored during heterogeneous transfer, hampering the utilization of domain-specific insights and leading to unstable mappings. Third, inappropriate information sharing among target and sources can easily lead to negative transfer. Traditional models fail to address these issues in a unified way. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a Double-Regularized Heterogeneous Gaussian Process framework (R^2-HGP). Specifically, a trainable prior probability mapping model is first proposed to align the heterogeneous input domains. The resulting aligned inputs are treated as latent variables, upon which a multi-source transfer GP model is constructed and the entire structure is integrated into a novel conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) based framework.

Massively multilingual models still underperform compared to language-specific adaptations, especially at smaller model scales. In this work, we investigate scaling as an efficient strategy for adapting pretrained models to new target languages. Through comprehensive scaling ablations with approximately FLOP-matched models, we test whether upscaling an English base model enables more effective and resource-efficient adaptation than standard continued pretraining. We find that, once exposed to sufficient target-language data, larger upscaled models can match or surpass the performance of smaller models continually pretrained on much more data, demonstrating the benefits of scaling for data efficiency. Scaling also helps preserve the base model's capabilities in English, thus reducing catastrophic forgetting. Finally, we explore whether such scaled, language-specific models can be merged to construct modular and flexible multilingual systems. We find that while merging remains less effective than joint multilingual training, upscaled merges perform better than smaller ones. We observe large performance differences across merging methods, suggesting potential for improvement through merging approaches specialized for language-level integration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5927\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u6765\u9ad8\u6548\u9002\u914d\u65b0\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4fdd\u7559\u539f\u59cb\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u5408\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4e2d\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u65f6\u4ecd\u900a\u4e8e\u5355\u8bed\u9002\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7FLOP\u5339\u914d\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u82f1\u8bed\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u8a00\u9002\u5e94\u4e0a\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff1b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7f29\u653e\u5bf9\u82f1\u8bed\u80fd\u529b\u4fdd\u6301\uff08\u7f13\u89e3\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff09\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u5c1d\u8bd5\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8db3\u591f\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u7528\u66f4\u591a\u6570\u636e\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u7f29\u653e\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4fdd\u7559\u82f1\u8bed\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5b9a\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u5408\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u53ca\u8054\u5408\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u7f29\u653e\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u6570\u636e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u9002\u914d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u80fd\u517c\u987e\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u8a00\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u4fdd\u6301\uff1b\u878d\u5408\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u9762\u5411\u8bed\u8a00\u7ea7\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u4e13\u7528\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Vision-language models such as CONCH offer rich semantic alignment and morphology-aware representations, while modern segmentation backbones like SegFormer preserve fine-grained spatial cues. However, combining these complementary strengths remains challenging, especially under weak supervision and without dense annotations. We propose a prototype learning framework for WSSS in histopathological images that integrates morphology-aware representations from CONCH, multi-scale structural cues from SegFormer, and text-guided semantic alignment to produce prototypes that are simultaneously semantically discriminative and spatially coherent. To effectively leverage these heterogeneous sources, we introduce text-guided prototype initialization that incorporates pathology descriptions to generate more complete and semantically accurate pseudo-masks. A structural distillation mechanism transfers spatial knowledge from SegFormer to preserve fine-grained morphological patterns and local tissue boundaries during prototype learning. Our approach produces high-quality pseudo masks without pixel-level annotations, improves localization completeness, and enhances semantic consistency across tissue types.

This study proposes the use of a recent kernel-based neural surrogate, KHRONOS. In this work, we blend sparse high-fidelity (HF) data with low-fidelity (LF) information to predict aerodynamic fields under varying constraints in computational resources. Unlike traditional approaches, KHRONOS is built upon variational principles, interpolation theory, and tensor decomposition. These elements provide a mathematical basis for heavy pruning compared to dense neural networks. Using the AirfRANS dataset as a high-fidelity benchmark and NeuralFoil to generate low-fidelity counterparts, this work compares the performance of KHRONOS with three contemporary model architectures: a multilayer perceptron (MLP), a graph neural network (GNN), and a physics-informed neural network (PINN). We consider varying levels of high-fidelity data availability (0%, 10%, and 30%) and increasingly complex geometry parameterizations. These are used to predict the surface pressure coefficient distribution over the airfoil. Results indicate that, whilst all models eventually achieve comparable predictive accuracy, KHRONOS excels in resource-constrained conditions. In this domain, KHRONOS consistently requires orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters and delivers much faster training and inference than contemporary dense neural networks at comparable accuracy. These findings highlight the potential of KHRONOS and similar architectures to balance accuracy and efficiency in multi-fidelity aerodynamic field prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6838\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578bKHRONOS\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u9ad8/\u4f4e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6c14\u52a8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4ee5\u66f4\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u66f4\u5feb\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u4e3b\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\uff08\u5982\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\uff09\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u591a\uff1b\u9700\u517c\u987e\u6c14\u52a8\u573a\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d8\u5206\u539f\u7406\u3001\u63d2\u503c\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5f20\u91cf\u5206\u89e3\u6784\u5efaKHRONOS\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u878d\u5408AirfRANS\uff08\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\uff09\u4e0eNeuralFoil\uff08\u4f4e\u4fdd\u771f\uff09\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6570\u636e\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff080%/10%/30%\uff09\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4MLP\u3001GNN\u3001PINN\u3002", "result": "KHRONOS\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u5c11\u6570\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u4e14\u8868\u9762\u538b\u529b\u7cfb\u6570\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "KHRONOS\u4e3a\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u6c14\u52a8\u573a\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6027\u4ef7\u6bd4\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6570\u5b66\u9a71\u52a8\u7a00\u758f\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u5de5\u7a0b\u4ee3\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

In many such settings, speakers of Indian languages frequently communicate using romanized text rather than native scripts, yet existing research rarely evaluates this orthographic variation using real-world data. We investigate how romanization impacts the reliability of LLMs in a critical domain: maternal and newborn healthcare triage. We benchmark leading LLMs on a real-world dataset of user-generated queries spanning five Indian languages and Nepali. Our results reveal consistent degradation in performance for romanized messages, with F1 scores trailing those of native scripts by 5-12 points. At our partner maternal health organization in India, this gap could cause nearly 2 million excess errors in triage. Crucially, this performance gap by scripts is not due to a failure in clinical reasoning. We demonstrate that LLMs often correctly infer the semantic intent of romanized queries. Nevertheless, their final classification outputs remain brittle in the presence of orthographic noise in romanized inputs. Our findings highlight a critical safety blind spot in LLM-based health systems: models that appear to understand romanized input may still fail to act on it reliably.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7f57\u9a6c\u5316\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u5370\u5ea6\u6bcd\u5a74\u5065\u5eb7\u5206\u8bca\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7f57\u9a6c\u5316\u8f93\u5165\u5bfc\u81f4F1\u5206\u6570\u4e0b\u964d5\u201312\u70b9\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u5927\u91cf\u6f5c\u5728\u8bef\u5224\uff0c\u95ee\u9898\u6839\u6e90\u5728\u4e8e\u6b63\u5b57\u6cd5\u566a\u58f0\u5bfc\u81f4\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "motivation": "\u5370\u5ea6\u4e34\u5e8a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7f57\u9a6c\u5316\u5370\u5ea6\u8bed\u8a00\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u6781\u5c11\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u8bc4\u4f30\u8be5\u6b63\u5b57\u6cd5\u53d8\u4f53\u5bf9LLM\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u6db5\u76d6\u4e94\u79cd\u5370\u5ea6\u8bed\u8a00\u53ca\u5c3c\u6cca\u5c14\u8bed\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u7528\u6237\u67e5\u8be2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4e3b\u6d41LLMs\u5728\u6bcd\u5e7c\u5065\u5eb7\u5206\u8bca\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u5206\u7c7b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u5206\u79bb\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "result": "\u7f57\u9a6c\u5316\u6587\u672c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eLLM\u6027\u80fd\uff08F1\u4e0b\u964d5\u201312\u70b9\uff09\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fd1200\u4e07\u989d\u5916\u5206\u8bca\u9519\u8bef\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u63a8\u65ad\u7f57\u9a6c\u5316\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u4f46\u6700\u7ec8\u5206\u7c7b\u4ecd\u56e0\u6b63\u5b57\u6cd5\u566a\u58f0\u800c\u8106\u5f31\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u5728\u533b\u7597\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5bf9\u7f57\u9a6c\u5316\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u2018\u770b\u4f3c\u7406\u89e3\u2019\u4e0d\u7b49\u4e8e\u2018\u53ef\u9760\u884c\u52a8\u2019\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u76f2\u533a\u3002"}}

General Scene Adaptation for VLN (GSA-VLN) shifts the focus from zero-shot generalization to continual, environment-specific adaptation, narrowing the gap between static benchmarks and real-world deployment. However, current GSA-VLN frameworks exclude user feedback, relying solely on unsupervised adaptation from repeated environmental exposure. In practice, user feedback offers natural and valuable supervision that can significantly enhance adaptation quality. We introduce a user-feedback-driven adaptation framework that extends GSA-VLN by systematically integrating human interactions into continual learning. Our approach converts user feedback-navigation instructions and corrective signals-into high-quality, environment-aligned training data, enabling efficient and realistic adaptation. A memory-bank warm-start mechanism further reuses previously acquired environmental knowledge, mitigating cold-start degradation and ensuring stable redeployment. Experiments on the GSA-R2R benchmark show that our method consistently surpasses strong baselines such as GR-DUET, improving navigation success and path efficiency.

While existing Safe Offline RL methods typically enforce soft expected-cost constraints, they do not guarantee forward invariance. Conversely, Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) provide rigorous safety guarantees but usually depend on expert-designed barrier functions or full knowledge of the system dynamics. We introduce Value-Guided Offline Control Barrier Functions (V-OCBF), a framework that learns a neural CBF entirely from offline demonstrations. Unlike prior approaches, V-OCBF does not assume access to the dynamics model; instead, it derives a recursive finite-difference barrier update, enabling model-free learning of a barrier that propagates safety information over time. Moreover, V-OCBF incorporates an expectile-based objective that avoids querying the barrier on out-of-distribution actions and restricts updates to the dataset-supported action set. The learned barrier is then used with a Quadratic Program (QP) formulation to synthesize real-time safe control. Across multiple case studies, V-OCBF yields substantially fewer safety violations than baseline methods while maintaining strong task performance, highlighting its scalability for offline synthesis of safety-critical controllers without online interaction or hand-engineered barriers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faV-OCBF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u7ebf\u793a\u8303\u6570\u636e\u5b66\u4e60\u795e\u7ecf\u63a7\u5236\u5c4f\u969c\u51fd\u6570\uff08CBF\uff09\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5c4f\u969c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u671f\u671b\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u76ee\u6807\u4e0eQP\u5b89\u5168\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5b89\u5168\u8fdd\u89c4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u6ee1\u8db3\u8f6f\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u524d\u5411\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff1b\u800c\u4f20\u7edfCBF\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6216\u7cbe\u786e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faValue-Guided Offline CBF\uff08V-OCBF\uff09\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u79bb\u7ebf\u6f14\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u795e\u7ecfCBF\uff1b2\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u9012\u5f52\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u5c4f\u969c\u66f4\u65b0\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b3\uff09\u5f15\u5165expectile-based\u76ee\u6807\u907f\u514dOOD\u52a8\u4f5c\u67e5\u8be2\u5e76\u9650\u5236\u66f4\u65b0\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u96c6\uff1b4\uff09\u5c06\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684CBF\u5d4c\u5165QP\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u5b89\u5168\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0cV-OCBF\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5b89\u5168\u8fdd\u89c4\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u6301\u5f3a\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u65e0\u5728\u7ebf\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u65e0\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5c4f\u969c\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "V-OCBF\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u5408\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u7406\u8bba\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4fdd\u969c\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Treatment selection for low to intermediate risk patients with severe aortic stenosis between surgical (SAVR) and transcatheter (TAVR) aortic valve replacement remains variable in clinical practice, driven by patient heterogeneity and institutional preferences. While existing models predict postprocedural risk, there is a lack of interpretable, individualized treatment recommendations that directly optimize long-term outcomes.\n  Methods. We introduce an interpretable prescriptive framework that integrates prognostic matching, counterfactual outcome modeling, and an Optimal Policy Tree (OPT) to recommend the treatment minimizing expected 5-year mortality. Using data from Hartford Hospital and St. Vincent's Hospital, we emulate randomization via prognostic matching and sample weighting and estimate counterfactual mortality under both SAVR and TAVR. The policy model, trained on these counterfactual predictions, partitions patients into clinically coherent subgroups and prescribes the treatment associated with lower estimated risk.\n  Findings. If the OPT prescriptions are applied, counterfactual evaluation showed an estimated reduction in 5-year mortality of 20.3\\% in Hartford and 13.8\\% in St. Vincent's relative to real-life prescriptions, showing promising generalizability to unseen data from a different institution.

A widely used approach is the ratio-of-densities method, which defines a time-indexed target path by reweighting probability-density trajectories from multiple models with positive, or in some cases, negative exponents. This construction, however, harbors a critical and previously unformalized failure mode: Marginal Path Collapse, where intermediate densities become non-normalizable even though endpoints remain valid. Collapse arises systematically when composing heterogeneous models trained on different noise schedules or datasets, including a common setting in molecular design where de-novo, conformer, and pocket-conditioned models must be combined for tasks such as flexible-pose scaffold decoration. We provide a novel and complete solution for the problem. First, we derive a simple path existence criterion that predicts exactly when collapse occurs from noise schedules and exponents alone. Second, we introduce Adaptive path Correction with Exponents (ACE), which extends Feynman-Kac steering to time-varying exponents and guarantees a valid probability path. On a synthetic 2D benchmark and on flexible-pose scaffold decoration, ACE eliminates collapse and enables high-guidance compositional generation, improving distributional and docking metrics over constant-exponent baselines and even specialized task-specific scaffold decoration models.

Token reduction, while extensively explored for video-only LLMs, is insufficient for the audio-visual domain, as these unimodal methods cannot leverage audio-visual cross-modal synergies. Furthermore, the distinct and dynamic information densities of audio and video render static budgets per modality suboptimal. How to perform token reduction on a joint audio-visual stream thus remains an unaddressed bottleneck. To fill this gap, we introduce EchoingPixels, a framework inspired by the coexistence and interaction of visuals and sound in real-world scenes. The core of our framework is the Cross-Modal Semantic Sieve (CS2), a module enabling early audio-visual interaction. Instead of compressing modalities independently, CS2 co-attends to the joint multimodal stream and reduces tokens from an entire combined pool of audio-visual tokens rather than using fixed budgets per modality. This single-pool approach allows it to adaptively allocate the token budget across both modalities and dynamically identify salient tokens in concert. To ensure this aggressive reduction preserves the vital temporal modeling capability, we co-design a Synchronization-Augmented RoPE (Sync-RoPE) to maintain critical temporal relationships for the sparsely selected tokens.

This article investigates these issues through the case of the BlueROV2, an open platform widely used for scientific experimentation. We propose a deep reinforcement learning approach based on the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, using an observation space that combines target-oriented navigation information, a virtual occupancy grid, and ray-casting along the boundaries of the operational area. The learned policy is compared against a reference deterministic kinematic planner, the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA), commonly employed as a robust baseline for obstacle avoidance. The evaluation is conducted in a realistic simulation environment and complemented by validation on a physical BlueROV2 supervised by a 3D digital twin of the test site, helping to reduce risks associated with real-world experimentation. The results show that the PPO policy consistently outperforms DWA in highly cluttered environments, notably thanks to better local adaptation and reduced collisions.

Federated unlearning has therefore emerged as a research frontier, aiming to remove a specific party's contribution from the learned model while preserving the utility of the remaining parties. However, most unlearning techniques focus on Horizontal Federated Learning (HFL), where data are partitioned by samples. In contrast, Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) allows organizations that possess complementary feature spaces to train a joint model without sharing raw data. The resulting feature-partitioned architecture renders HFL-oriented unlearning methods ineffective. In this paper, we propose REMISVFU, a plug-and-play representation misdirection framework that enables fast, client-level unlearning in splitVFL systems. When a deletion request arrives, the forgetting party collapses its encoder output to a randomly sampled anchor on the unit sphere, severing the statistical link between its features and the global model. To maintain utility for the remaining parties, the server jointly optimizes a retention loss and a forgetting loss, aligning their gradients via orthogonal projection to eliminate destructive interference.

These models can serve as backbones for region-of-interest (ROI) image analysis or patch-level feature extractors in whole-slide images (WSIs) based on multiple instance learning (MIL). Existing pathology foundation models (PFMs) are typically pre-trained on Hematoxylin-Eosin (H&E) stained pathology images. However, images with special stains, such as immunohistochemistry, are also frequently used in clinical practice. PFMs pre-trained mainly on H\\&E-stained images may be limited in clinical applications involving special stains. To address this issue, we propose StainNet, a specialized foundation model for special stains based on the vision transformer (ViT) architecture. StainNet adopts a self-distillation SSL approach and is trained on over 1.4 million patch images cropping from 20,231 publicly available special staining WSIs in the HISTAI database. To evaluate StainNet, we conduct experiments on an in-house slide-level liver malignancy classification task and two public ROI-level datasets to demonstrate its strong ability. We also perform few-ratio learning and retrieval evaluations, and compare StainNet with recently larger PFMs to further highlight its strengths.

Recent work has proposed to use chunked critics, which estimate the value of short action sequences (\"chunks\") rather than individual actions, speeding up value backup. However, extracting policies from chunked critics is challenging: policies must output the entire action chunk open-loop, which can be sub-optimal for environments that require policy reactivity and also challenging to model especially when the chunk length grows. Our key insight is to decouple the chunk length of the critic from that of the policy, allowing the policy to operate over shorter action chunks. We propose a novel algorithm that achieves this by optimizing the policy against a distilled critic for partial action chunks, constructed by optimistically backing up from the original chunked critic to approximate the maximum value achievable when a partial action chunk is extended to a complete one. This design retains the benefits of multi-step value propagation while sidestepping both the open-loop sub-optimality and the difficulty of learning action chunking policies for long action chunks. We evaluate our method on challenging, long-horizon offline goal-conditioned tasks and show that it reliably outperforms prior methods.

Yet the geometric behavior of these agentic loops (whether they converge, diverge, or exhibit more complex dynamics) remains poorly understood. This paper introduces a geometric framework for analyzing agentic trajectories in semantic embedding space, treating iterative transformations as discrete dynamical systems. We distinguish the artifact space, where linguistic transformations occur, from the embedding space, where geometric measurements are performed. Because cosine similarity is biased by embedding anisotropy, we introduce an isotonic calibration that eliminates systematic bias and aligns similarities with human semantic judgments while preserving high local stability. This enables rigorous measurement of trajectories, clusters and attractors. Through controlled experiments on singular agentic loops, we identify two fundamental regimes. A contractive rewriting loop converges toward a stable attractor with decreasing dispersion, while an exploratory summarize and negate loop produces unbounded divergence with no cluster formation. These regimes display qualitatively distinct geometric signatures of contraction and expansion.

To address this challenge, we propose EmerFlow, a novel LLM-empowered representation learning framework that generates distinctive embeddings for emerging items. It first enriches the raw features of emerging items through LLM reasoning, then aligns these representations with the embedding space of the existing recommendation model. Finally, new interactions are incorporated through meta-learning to refine the embeddings. This enables EmerFlow to learn expressive embeddings for emerging items from only limited interactions.

Existing imputation-based methods attempt to estimate missing views to restore data associations, but indiscriminate imputation often introduces noise and bias, especially when the available information is insufficient. Imputation-free methods avoid this risk by relying solely on observed data, but struggle under severe incompleteness due to the lack of cross-view complementarity. To address this issue, we propose Informativeness-based Selective imputation Multi-View Clustering (ISMVC). Our method evaluates the imputation-relevant informativeness of each missing position based on intra-view similarity and cross-view consistency, and selectively imputes only when sufficient support is available. Furthermore, we integrate this selection with a variational autoencoder equipped with a mixture-of-Gaussians prior to learn clustering-friendly latent representations. By performing distribution-level imputation, ISMVC not only stabilizes the aggregation of posterior distributions but also explicitly models imputation uncertainty, enabling robust fusion and preventing overconfident reconstructions. Compared with existing cautious imputation strategies that depend on training dynamics or model feedback, our method is lightweight, data-driven, and model-agnostic. It can be readily integrated into existing IMC models as a plug-in module.

Any4D directly generates per-pixel motion and geometry predictions for N frames, in contrast to prior work that typically focuses on either 2-view dense scene flow or sparse 3D point tracking. Moreover, unlike other recent methods for 4D reconstruction from monocular RGB videos, Any4D can process additional modalities and sensors such as RGB-D frames, IMU-based egomotion, and Radar Doppler measurements, when available. One of the key innovations that allows for such a flexible framework is a modular representation of a 4D scene; specifically, per-view 4D predictions are encoded using a variety of egocentric factors (depthmaps and camera intrinsics) represented in local camera coordinates, and allocentric factors (camera extrinsics and scene flow) represented in global world coordinates.

As research increasingly leverages audio-visual materials to analyze the display of emotions, the emergence of multimodal generative AI promises great advances. However, we lack evidence about the effectiveness of multimodal AI in emotion analysis. This paper addresses this gap by evaluating current multimodal large language models (mLLMs) in video-based analysis of emotional arousal in two complementary data sets of human-labeled video recordings. I find that under ideal circumstances, mLLMs' emotional arousal ratings are highly reliable and show little to know indication of demographic bias. However, in recordings of speakers in real-world parliamentary debates, mLLMs' arousal ratings fail to deliver on this promise with potential negative consequences for downstream statistical inferences. This study therefore underscores the need for continued, thorough evaluation of emerging generative AI methods in political analysis and contributes a suitable replicable framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08mLLMs\uff09\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u60c5\u7eea\u5524\u9192\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5728\u7406\u60f3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u65e0\u660e\u663e\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u8bae\u4f1a\u8fa9\u8bba\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u7edf\u8ba1\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u6301\u7eed\u4e25\u8c28\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u653f\u6cbb\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5173\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5728\u60c5\u7eea\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u800c\u653f\u6cbb\u4f20\u64ad\u7814\u7a76\u6b63\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u4f7f\u7528\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u6750\u6599\u5e76\u4f9d\u8d56\u65b0\u5174AI\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08mLLMs\uff09\u5bf9\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u60c5\u7eea\u5524\u9192\u5ea6\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u68c0\u9a8c\u5176\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u6f5c\u5728\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7406\u60f3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0cmLLMs\u7684\u60c5\u7eea\u5524\u9192\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u504f\u5dee\uff1b\u4f46\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u8bae\u4f1a\u8fa9\u8bba\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\uff0c\u5176\u8bc4\u5206\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u8bef\u5bfc\u4e0b\u6e38\u7edf\u8ba1\u63a8\u65ad\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u5bf9\u65b0\u5174\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u653f\u6cbb\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5f00\u5c55\u6301\u7eed\u3001\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u6b64\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

However, building agents for these tasks faces a critical bottleneck: the reliance on ever-expanding interaction history incurs substantial context overhead. Existing context management and compression techniques often fail to preserve vital semantic information, leading to degraded task performance. We propose AgentProg, a program-guided approach for agent context management that reframes the interaction history as a program with variables and control flow. By organizing information according to the structure of program, this structure provides a principled mechanism to determine which information should be retained and which can be discarded. We further integrate a global belief state mechanism inspired by Belief MDP framework to handle partial observability and adapt to unexpected environmental changes. Experiments on AndroidWorld and our extended long-horizon task suite demonstrate that AgentProg has achieved the state-of-the-art success rates on these benchmarks. More importantly, it maintains robust performance on long-horizon tasks while baseline methods experience catastrophic degradation.

Segmenting these filaments in biological images is a fundamental step for quantitative analysis. Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved the performance of filament segmentation. However, there is a big challenge in acquiring high quality pixel-level annotated dataset for filamentous structures, as the dense distribution and geometric properties of filaments making manual annotation extremely laborious and time-consuming.

Considering existing RL- based finetuning methods, entropy intervention turns out to be an effective way to benefit exploratory ability, thereby improving policy performance.

They ig- nore the entropy intervention during the RL sampling that can boost the performance of GRPO by improving the di- versity of responses. In this paper, we propose Selective- adversarial Entropy Intervention, namely SaEI, which en- hances policy entropy by distorting the visual input with the token-selective adversarial objective coming from the en- tropy of sampled responses. Specifically, we first propose entropy-guided adversarial sampling (EgAS) that formu- lates the entropy of sampled responses as an adversarial ob- jective. Then, the corresponding adversarial gradient can be used to attack the visual input for producing adversarial samples, allowing the policy model to explore a larger an- swer space during RL sampling. Then, we propose token- selective entropy computation (TsEC) to maximize the ef- fectiveness of adversarial attack in EgAS without distorting factual knowledge within VLMs. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets show that our proposed method can greatly improve policy exploration via entropy intervention, to boost reasoning capabilities.

Real-world scenarios involve diverse and coupled degradations, making it necessary to provide diffusion models with richer and more informative guidance. However, existing methods often assume known degradation severity and rely on CLIP text encoders that cannot capture numerical severity, limiting their generalization ability. To address this, we propose \\textbf{HD-CLIP} (\\textbf{H}ierarchical \\textbf{D}egradation CLIP), which decomposes a low-quality image into a semantic embedding and an ordinal degradation embedding that captures ordered relationships and allows interpolation across unseen levels.

We propose Corrective Sequential Planning Benchmark (CoSPlan) to evaluate VLMs in error-prone, vision-based sequential planning tasks across 4 domains: maze navigation, block rearrangement, image reconstruction,and object reorganization. CoSPlan assesses two key abilities: Error Detection (identifying non-optimal action) and Step Completion (correcting and completing action sequences to reach the goal). Despite using state-of-the-art reasoning techniques such as Chain-of-Thought and Scene Graphs, VLMs (e.g. Intern-VLM and Qwen2) struggle on CoSPlan, failing to leverage contextual cues to reach goals. Addressing this, we propose a novel training-free method, Scene Graph Incremental updates (SGI), which introduces intermediate reasoning steps between the initial and goal states. SGI helps VLMs reason about sequences, yielding an average performance gain of 5.2%.

Despite significant empirical advancements in backdoor research, the lack of rigorous theoretical analysis limits understanding of underlying mechanisms, constraining attack predictability and adaptability. Therefore, we provide a theoretical analysis targeting backdoor attacks, focusing on how sparse decision boundaries enable disproportionate model manipulation. Based on this finding, we derive a closed-form, ambiguous boundary region, wherein negligible relabeled samples induce substantial misclassification. Influence function analysis further quantifies significant parameter shifts caused by these margin samples, with minimal impact on clean accuracy, formally grounding why such low poison rates suffice for efficacious attacks. Leveraging these insights, we propose Eminence, an explainable and robust black-box backdoor framework with provable theoretical guarantees and inherent stealth properties.

Current protection methods are limited to passively degrading image quality, failing to achieve stable control. While Targeted Data Protection (TDP) offers a promising paradigm for active redirection toward user-specified target concepts, existing TDP attempts suffer from poor controllability due to snapshot-matching approaches that fail to account for complete learning dynamics. We introduce TAFAP (Trajectory Alignment via Fine-tuning with Adversarial Perturbations), the first method to successfully achieve effective TDP by controlling the entire training trajectory. Unlike snapshot-based methods whose protective influence is easily diluted as training progresses, TAFAP employs trajectory-matching inspired by dataset distillation to enforce persistent, verifiable transformations throughout fine-tuning. We validate our method through extensive experiments, demonstrating the first successful targeted transformation in diffusion models with simultaneous control over both identity and visual patterns. TAFAP significantly outperforms existing TDP attempts, achieving robust redirection toward target concepts while maintaining high image quality.

We address the core limitation of current motion generation methods - the combined lack of large-scale heterogeneous animal motion data and unified generative frameworks capable of jointly modeling arbitrary skeletal topologies and textual conditions. To this end, we introduce OmniZoo, a large-scale animal motion dataset spanning 140 species and 32,979 sequences, enriched with multimodal annotations. Building on OmniZoo, we propose a generalized autoregressive motion generation framework capable of producing text-driven motions for arbitrary skeletal topologies. Central to our model is a Topology-aware Skeleton Embedding Module that encodes geometric and structural properties of any skeleton into a shared token space, enabling seamless fusion with textual semantics.

In this work, we derive a unified operator-theoretoretic description of neural training dynamics directly from gradient descent. Starting from the exact evolution $\\dot e_t = -M(t)e_t$ in function space, we apply Kato perturbation theory to obtain a rigorous system of coupled mode ODEs and show that, after coarse-graining, these dynamics converge to a spectral transport--dissipation PDE \\[ \\partial_t g + \\partial_\u03bb(v g) = -\u03bbg + S, \\] where $v$ captures eigenbasis drift and $S$ encodes nonlocal spectral coupling.\n  We prove that neural training preserves functional regularity, forcing the drift to take an asymptotic power-law form $v(\u03bb,t)\\sim -c(t)\u03bb^b$. In the weak-coupling regime -- naturally induced by spectral locality and SGD noise -- the PDE admits self-similar solutions with a resolution frontier, polynomial amplitude growth, and power-law dissipation. This structure yields explicit scaling-law exponents, explains the geometry of double descent, and shows that the effective training time satisfies $\u03c4(t)=t^\u03b1L(t)$ for slowly varying $L$.\n  Finally, we show that NTK training and feature learning arise as two limits of the same PDE: $v\\equiv 0$ recovers lazy dynamics, while $v\\neq 0$ produces representation drift. Our results provide a unified spectral framework connecting operator geometry, optimization dynamics, and the universal scaling behavior of modern deep networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u7b97\u5b50\u7406\u8bba\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u8c31\u8f93\u8fd0-\u8017\u6563\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u6f02\u79fb\u3001\u6b63\u5219\u6027\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u6807\u5ea6\u5f8b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u91caNTK\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\u5904\u4e8e\u7c97\u7cd9\u3001\u6709\u9650\u6b63\u5219\u6027\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5176Jacobian\u7b97\u5b50\u8c31\u5448\u91cd\u5c3e\u5206\u5e03\u4e14\u57fa\u5e95\u53d1\u751f\u663e\u8457\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u5206\u6790\uff08\u5982NTK\uff09\u96be\u4ee5\u523b\u753b\u771f\u5b9e\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u666e\u9002\u7684\u7b97\u5b50\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6f14\u5316\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u8fd0\u7528Kato\u6270\u52a8\u7406\u8bba\u5bfc\u51fa\u8026\u5408\u6a21\u6001\u5e38\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7ec4\uff1b\u7ecf\u7c97\u7c92\u5316\u5904\u7406\u5f97\u5230\u8c31\u8f93\u8fd0-\u8017\u6563PDE\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u5f31\u8026\u5408\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0e\u81ea\u76f8\u4f3c\u89e3\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u6807\u5ea6\u5f8b\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u5f62\u5f0f\uff1b\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6781\u9650\u5206\u6790\u5173\u8054NTK\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4fdd\u6301\u51fd\u6570\u6b63\u5219\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6f02\u79fb\u901f\u5ea6\u6e10\u8fd1\u5448\u5e42\u5f8b\u5f62\u5f0f\uff1b\u5728\u5f31\u8026\u5408\u4e0bPDE\u5b58\u5728\u5177\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u524d\u6cbf\u4e0e\u5e42\u5f8b\u8017\u6563\u7684\u81ea\u76f8\u4f3c\u89e3\uff1b\u7ed9\u51fa\u53cc\u4e0b\u964d\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u6807\u5ea6\u5f8b\u6307\u6570\u53ca\u6709\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u03c4(t)=t^\u03b1L(t)\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u523b\u753b\uff1b\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u91caNTK\uff08v\u22610\uff09\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\uff08v\u22600\uff09\u4e3a\u540c\u4e00PDE\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u6781\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u8fde\u63a5\u7b97\u5b50\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\u666e\u9002\u6807\u5ea6\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u8c31\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u73b0\u4ee3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u672c\u8d28\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

This shift is driven by two parallel trends: the widespread individual adoption of LLMs by reviewers to manage workload (the \"Lazy Reviewer\" hypothesis) and the formal institutional deployment of AI-powered assessment systems by conferences like AAAI and Stanford's Agents4Science. This study investigates the robustness of these \"LLM-as-a-Judge\" systems (both illicit and sanctioned) to adversarial PDF manipulation. Unlike general jailbreaks, we focus on a distinct incentive: flipping \"Reject\" decisions to \"Accept,\" for which we develop a novel evaluation metric which we term as WAVS (Weighted Adversarial Vulnerability Score). We curated a dataset of 200 scientific papers and adapted 15 domain-specific attack strategies to this task, evaluating them across 13 Language Models, including GPT-5, Claude Haiku, and DeepSeek.

The information exchange enhances the pairwise self-attention within slices computed by the Transformer blocks, directly contributing to the attention maps for object localization. TranSamba achieves effective volumetric modeling with time complexity that scales linearly with the input volume depth and maintains constant memory usage for batch processing.

While deep learning models can express confidence in their predictions, they often suffer from poor calibration, a cognitive bias where expressed confidence does not reflect true competence. Do models truly know what they know? Drawing from human cognitive science, we propose a new framework for evaluating and leveraging AI metacognition. We introduce meta-d', a psychologically-grounded measure of metacognitive sensitivity, to characterise how reliably a model's confidence predicts its own accuracy. We then use this dynamic sensitivity score as context for a bandit-based arbiter that performs test-time model selection, learning which of several expert models to trust for a given task. Our experiments across multiple datasets and deep learning model combinations (including CNNs and VLMs) demonstrate that this metacognitive approach improves joint-inference accuracy over constituent models. This work provides a novel behavioural account of AI models, recasting ensemble selection as a problem of evaluating both short-term signals (confidence prediction scores) and medium-term traits (metacognitive sensitivity).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u7684AI\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5fc3\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u6307\u6807meta-d'\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u8be5\u6307\u6807\u6307\u5bfc\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u6574\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u8f93\u51fa\u9884\u6d4b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u5e38\u5b58\u5728\u6821\u51c6\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5373\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4e0d\u80fd\u771f\u5b9e\u53cd\u6620\u5176\u80fd\u529b\uff09\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u2018\u77e5\u9053\u81ea\u5df1\u77e5\u9053\u4ec0\u4e48\u2019\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fameta-d'\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u654f\u611f\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u81c2\u8d4c\u535a\u673a\uff08bandit\uff09\u7684\u4ef2\u88c1\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u4f9d\u636emeta-d'\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u5408\uff08CNN\u3001VLM\u7b49\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8054\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u9009\u62e9\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u77ed\u671f\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff09\u4e0e\u4e2d\u671f\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff09\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u884c\u4e3a\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Our problem differs significantly from existing studies on breathing rate estimation, which assume the number of people is known a priori.

This study introduces a novel Robust Hybrid Physics-ML framework employing Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for highly accurate, uncertainty-aware Jw prediction. The core innovation lies in training the GPR on the residual error between the detailed, non-linear FO physical model prediction (Jw_physical) and the experimental water flux (Jw_actual).

However, due to weak heuristics for auxiliary constructions, AI for geometry problem solving remains dominated by expert models such as AlphaGeometry 2, which rely heavily on large-scale data synthesis and search for both training and evaluation. In this work, we make the first attempt to build a medalist-level LLM agent for geometry and present InternGeometry. InternGeometry overcomes the heuristic limitations in geometry by iteratively proposing propositions and auxiliary constructions, verifying them with a symbolic engine, and reflecting on the engine's feedback to guide subsequent proposals. A dynamic memory mechanism enables InternGeometry to conduct more than two hundred interactions with the symbolic engine per problem. To further accelerate learning, we introduce Complexity-Boosting Reinforcement Learning (CBRL), which gradually increases the complexity of synthesized problems across training stages. Built on InternThinker-32B, InternGeometry solves 44 of 50 IMO geometry problems (2000-2024), exceeding the average gold medalist score (40.9), using only 13K training examples, just 0.004% of the data used by AlphaGeometry 2, demonstrating the potential of LLM agents on expert-level geometry tasks. InternGeometry can also propose novel auxiliary constructions for IMO problems that do not appear in human solutions.

However, existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with simultaneously modeling spatial relationships within video frames and understanding the causal dynamics of temporal evolution on complex and reasoning-intensive VideoQA task. In this work, we equip MLLM with a comprehensive and extensible Video Toolkit, to enhance MLLM's spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities and ensure the harmony between the quantity and diversity of tools. To better control the tool invocation sequence and avoid toolchain shortcut issues, we propose a Spatiotemporal Reasoning Framework (STAR) that strategically schedules temporal and spatial tools, thereby progressively localizing the key area in the video. Our STAR framework enhances GPT-4o using lightweight tools, achieving an 8.2% gain on VideoMME and 4.6% on LongVideoBench.

However, existing constraint satisfaction methods face efficiency-applicability trade-offs, with hard constraint methods suffering from either high computational complexity or restrictive assumptions on constraint structures. The Sampling Kaczmarz-Motzkin (SKM) method is a randomized iterative algorithm for solving large-scale linear inequality systems with favorable convergence properties, but its argmax operations introduce non-differentiability, posing challenges for neural network applications. This work proposes the Trainable Sampling Kaczmarz-Motzkin Network (T-SKM-Net) framework and, for the first time, systematically integrates SKM-type methods into neural network constraint satisfaction. The framework transforms mixed constraint problems into pure inequality problems through null space transformation, employs SKM for iterative solving, and maps solutions back to the original constraint space, efficiently handling both equality and inequality constraints. We provide theoretical proof of post-processing effectiveness in expectation and end-to-end trainability guarantees based on unbiased gradient estimators, demonstrating that despite non-differentiable operations, the framework supports standard backpropagation. On the DCOPF case118 benchmark, our method achieves 4.27ms/item GPU serial forward inference with 0.0025% max optimality gap with post-processing mode and 5.25ms/item with 0.0008% max optimality gap with joint training mode, delivering over 25$\\times$ speedup compared to the pandapower solver while maintaining zero constraint violations under given tolerance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u91c7\u6837Kaczmarz-Motzkin\u7f51\u7edc\uff08T-SKM-Net\uff09\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5c06SKM\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u878d\u5165\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u6362\u548c\u53ef\u5fae\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7ea6\u675f\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u5728DCOPF\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u901f\u4e14\u96f6\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u53cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u9002\u7528\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u786c\u7ea6\u675f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u9762\u4e34\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6216\u5bf9\u7ea6\u675f\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f3a\u5047\u8bbe\uff1b\u800c\u7ecf\u5178SKM\u7b97\u6cd5\u867d\u6536\u655b\u6027\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5176argmax\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0d\u53ef\u5fae\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5d4c\u5165\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faT-SKM-Net\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u7528\u96f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u6362\u5c06\u6df7\u5408\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u7b49\u5f0f+\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\uff09\u8f6c\u4e3a\u7eaf\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1b2\uff09\u5d4c\u5165SKM\u8fed\u4ee3\u6c42\u89e3\uff1b3\uff09\u6620\u5c04\u56de\u539f\u7ea6\u675f\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b4\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65e0\u504f\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u4fdd\u969c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728DCOPF case118\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u8fbe4.27ms/\u6837\u672c\uff08GPU\u4e32\u884c\uff09\u3001\u6700\u5927\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u95f4\u96990.0025%\uff1b\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e3a5.25ms/\u6837\u672c\u3001\u6700\u5927\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u95f4\u96990.0008%\uff1b\u76f8\u8f83pandapower\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u63d0\u901f\u8d8525\u500d\uff0c\u4e14\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u53cd\u7387\u4e3a\u96f6\uff08\u7ed9\u5b9a\u5bb9\u5dee\u5185\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "T-SKM-Net\u6210\u529f\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u6027\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u795e\u7ecf\u7ea6\u675f\u6c42\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

We present NormCode, a semiformal language for constructing plans of inferences, structured decompositions where each step operates in data isolation and receives only explicitly passed inputs, which eliminates crossstep contamination by design. NormCode enforces a strict separation between semantic operations (LLMdriven reasoning, nondeterministic) and syntactic operations (deterministic data restructuring), enabling precise cost and reliability tracing.

While methods that crop salient regions of an image offer a partial solution, we identify a critical limitation they introduce: \"Contextual Blindness\". This failure occurs due to structural disconnect between high-fidelity details (from the crop) and the broader global context (from the original image), even when all necessary visual information is present. We argue that this limitation stems not from a lack of information 'Quantity', but from a lack of 'Structural Diversity' in the model's input. To resolve this, we propose Visual Funnel, a training-free, two-step approach. Visual Funnel first performs Contextual Anchoring to identify the region of interest in a single forward pass. It then constructs an Entropy-Scaled Portfolio that preserves the hierarchical context - ranging from focal detail to broader surroundings - by dynamically determining crop sizes based on attention entropy and refining crop centers. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Visual Funnel significantly outperforms naive single-crop and unstructured multi-crop baselines. Our results further validate that simply adding more unstructured crops provides limited or even detrimental benefits, confirming that the hierarchical structure of our portfolio is key to resolving Contextual Blindness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faVisual Funnel\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4e24\u6b65\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u951a\u5b9a\u4e0e\u71b5\u7f29\u653e\u7ec4\u5408\uff09\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u4e2d\u7684'\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5931\u660e'\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u8f93\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u591a\u6837\u6027\u800c\u975e\u4fe1\u606f\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MLLMs\u867d\u5177\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u611f\u77e5\u56fe\u50cf\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ec6\u8282\uff1b\u88c1\u526a\u663e\u8457\u533a\u57df\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f15\u5165\u4e86'\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5931\u660e'\u95ee\u9898\u2014\u2014\u5373\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5272\u88c2\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684Visual Funnel\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b65Contextual Anchoring\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5174\u8da3\u533a\u57df\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6b65Entropy-Scaled Portfolio\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u71b5\u52a8\u6001\u786e\u5b9a\u88c1\u526a\u5c3a\u5bf8\u4e0e\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u7126\u70b9\u7ec6\u8282\u5230\u5468\u8fb9\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u56fe\u50cf\u7ec4\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u88c1\u526a\u548c\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u591a\u88c1\u526a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u589e\u52a0\u65e0\u5e8f\u88c1\u526a\u53cd\u800c\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u751a\u81f3\u6709\u5bb3\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u662f\u5173\u952e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89e3\u51b3MLLM\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u74f6\u9888\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5728\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5355\u7eaf\u589e\u52a0\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\uff1bVisual Funnel\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Within this paradigm, agent training is typically formulated as a zero-sum Markov game between a protagonist and an adversary to enhance policy robustness. However, the trainable nature of the adversary inevitably induces non-stationarity in the learning dynamics, leading to exacerbated training instability and convergence difficulties, particularly in high-dimensional complex environments. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Uncertainty-Aware Critic Ensemble for robust adversarial Reinforcement learning (UACER), which consists of two strategies: 1) Diversified critic ensemble: a diverse set of K critic networks is exploited in parallel to stabilize Q-value estimation rather than conventional single-critic architectures for both variance reduction and robustness enhancement. 2) Time-varying Decay Uncertainty (TDU) mechanism: advancing beyond simple linear combinations, we develop a variance-derived Q-value aggregation strategy that explicitly incorporates epistemic uncertainty to dynamically regulate the exploration-exploitation trade-off while simultaneously stabilizing the training process.

Traditional design methodologies that blend human expertise with specialized simulation tools scale poorly with the increasing system complexity. Recent studies adopt generative artificial intelligence to design plausible human-centric indoor layouts. However, they do not consider the underlying physics, making them unsuitable for the DC design that sets quantifiable operational objectives and strict physical constraints. To bridge the gap, we propose Phythesis, a novel framework that synergizes large language models (LLMs) and physics-guided evolutionary optimization to automate simulation-ready (SimReady) scene synthesis for energy-efficient DC design. Phythesis employs an iterative bi-level optimization architecture, where (i) the LLM-driven optimization level generates physically plausible three-dimensional layouts and self-criticizes them to refine the scene topology, and (ii) the physics-informed optimization level identifies the optimal asset parameters and selects the best asset combination. Experiments on three generation scales show that Phythesis achieves 57.3% generation success rate increase and 11.5% power usage effectiveness (PUE) improvement, compared with the vanilla LLM-based solution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPhythesis\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9762\u5411\u80fd\u6548\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u5c31\u7eea\uff08SimReady\uff09\u4e09\u7ef4\u573a\u666f\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u590d\u6742\u6027\u589e\u957f\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7269\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5bf9\u91cf\u5316\u8fd0\u884c\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u4e25\u683c\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u5c42\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u4e0a\u5c42\u7531LLM\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5e76\u81ea\u6279\u8bc4\u4e09\u7ef4\u5e03\u5c40\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u4e0b\u5c42\u4e3a\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u641c\u7d22\u6700\u4f18\u8bbe\u5907\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u7ec4\u5408\u3002\u6574\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u878d\u5408LLM\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u4eff\u771f\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u751f\u6210\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u7eafLLM\u65b9\u6848\uff0cPhythesis\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u534757.3%\uff0cPUE\u964d\u4f4e11.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "Phythesis\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u80fd\u6548\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

The core technical challenge of LVMR stems from the computational infeasibility of processing entire lengthy videos in a single pass. This limitation has established a 'Search-then-Refine' approach, where candidates are rapidly narrowed down, and only those portions are analyzed, as the dominant paradigm for LVMR. However, existing approaches to this paradigm face severe limitations. Conventional supervised learning suffers from limited scalability and poor generalization, despite substantial resource consumption. Yet, existing zero-shot methods also fail, facing a dual challenge: (1) their heuristic strategies cause a 'search' phase candidate explosion, and (2) the 'refine' phase, which is vulnerable to semantic discrepancy, requires high-cost VLMs for verification, incurring significant computational overhead. We propose \\textbf{P}oint-\\textbf{to}-\\textbf{S}pan (P2S), a novel training-free framework to overcome this challenge of inefficient 'search' and costly 'refine' phases. P2S overcomes these challenges with two key innovations: an 'Adaptive Span Generator' to prevent the search phase candidate explosion, and 'Query Decomposition' to refine candidates without relying on high-cost VLM verification.

To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive Replay Buffer (ARB), a novel approach that dynamically prioritizes data sampling based on a lightweight metric we call 'on-policyness'. Unlike prior methods that rely on complex learning procedures or fixed ratios, ARB is designed to be learning-free and simple to implement, seamlessly integrating into existing O2O RL algorithms. It assesses how closely collected trajectories align with the current policy's behavior and assigns a proportional sampling weight to each transition within that trajectory. This strategy effectively leverages offline data for initial stability while progressively focusing learning on the most relevant, high-rewarding online experiences.

However, its performance heavily relies on dense, high-quality input imagery, an assumption that is often violated in real-world applications, where data is typically sparse and motion-blurred. These two issues create a vicious cycle: sparse views ignore the multi-view constraints necessary to resolve motion blur, while motion blur erases high-frequency details crucial for aligning the limited views. Thus, reconstruction often fails catastrophically, with fragmented views and a low-frequency bias. To break this cycle, we introduce CoherentGS, a novel framework for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from sparse and blurry images. Our key insight is to address these compound degradations using a dual-prior strategy. Specifically, we combine two pre-trained generative models: a specialized deblurring network for restoring sharp details and providing photometric guidance, and a diffusion model that offers geometric priors to fill in unobserved regions of the scene. This dual-prior strategy is supported by several key techniques, including a consistency-guided camera exploration module that adaptively guides the generative process, and a depth regularization loss that ensures geometric plausibility.

To bridge the gap between static storage and dynamic reasoning, we propose $\\textbf{ReMe}$ ($\\textit{Remember Me, Refine Me}$), a comprehensive framework for experience-driven agent evolution. ReMe innovates across the memory lifecycle via three mechanisms: 1) $\\textit{multi-faceted distillation}$, which extracts fine-grained experiences by recognizing success patterns, analyzing failure triggers and generating comparative insights; 2) $\\textit{context-adaptive reuse}$, which tailors historical insights to new contexts via scenario-aware indexing; and 3) $\\textit{utility-based refinement}$, which autonomously adds valid memories and prunes outdated ones to maintain a compact, high-quality experience pool. Extensive experiments on BFCL-V3 and AppWorld demonstrate that ReMe establishes a new state-of-the-art in agent memory system. Crucially, we observe a significant memory-scaling effect: Qwen3-8B equipped with ReMe outperforms larger, memoryless Qwen3-14B, suggesting that self-evolving memory provides a computation-efficient pathway for lifelong learning.

Existing inference-time mitigation methods typically manipulate classifier-free guidance (CFG) or perturb prompt embeddings; however, they often struggle to reduce memorization without compromising alignment with the conditioning prompt. We introduce CAPTAIN, a training-free framework that mitigates memorization by directly modifying latent features during denoising. CAPTAIN first applies frequency-based noise initialization to reduce the tendency to replicate memorized patterns early in the denoising process. It then identifies the optimal denoising timesteps for feature injection and localizes memorized regions. Finally, CAPTAIN injects semantically aligned features from non-memorized reference images into localized latent regions, suppressing memorization while preserving prompt fidelity and visual quality. Our experiments show that CAPTAIN achieves substantial reductions in memorization compared to CFG-based baselines while maintaining strong alignment with the intended prompt.", "AI": {"tldr": "CAPTAIN\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7f13\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u4fee\u6539\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u9891\u57df\u566a\u58f0\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u3001\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bb0\u5fc6\u533a\u57df\u3001\u6ce8\u5165\u975e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7279\u5f81\uff09\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u590d\u73b0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u610f\u4e2d\u590d\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u7248\u6743\u98ce\u9669\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u8c03\u6574CFG\u6216\u6270\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u5d4c\u5165\uff09\u5e38\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u964d\u4f4e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u4e0e\u4fdd\u6301\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "method": "CAPTAIN\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u9891\u7387\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4ee5\u6291\u5236\u65e9\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u5f0f\u590d\u73b0\uff1b2\uff09\u8bc6\u522b\u6700\u4f18\u53bb\u566a\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u5e76\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u533a\u57df\uff1b3\uff09\u5411\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c40\u90e8\u533a\u57df\u6ce8\u5165\u6765\u81ea\u975e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCAPTAIN\u76f8\u6bd4CFG\u57fa\u7ebf\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u6301\u4e86\u5f3a\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "CAPTAIN\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u590d\u73b0\u3002"}}

To address this gap, we construct a Radar-LiDAR scene flow dataset based on a public real-world automotive dataset. We propose an effective preprocessing strategy for radar denoising and scene flow label generation, deriving more reliable flow ground truth for radar points out of the object boundaries. Additionally, we introduce RaLiFlow, the first joint scene flow learning framework for 4D radar and LiDAR, which achieves effective radar-LiDAR fusion through a novel Dynamic-aware Bidirectional Cross-modal Fusion (DBCF) module and a carefully designed set of loss functions. The DBCF module integrates dynamic cues from radar into the local cross-attention mechanism, enabling the propagation of contextual information across modalities. Meanwhile, the proposed loss functions mitigate the adverse effects of unreliable radar data during training and enhance the instance-level consistency in scene flow predictions from both modalities, particularly for dynamic foreground areas. Extensive experiments on the repurposed scene flow dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms existing LiDAR-based and radar-based single-modal methods by a significant margin.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e4D\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u96f7\u8fbe\u4e0eLiDAR\u8054\u5408\u573a\u666f\u6d41\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6846\u67b6RaLiFlow\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u96f7\u8fbe-LiDAR\u573a\u666f\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff08DBCF\uff09\u548c\u5b9a\u5236\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u573a\u666f\u6d41\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0eLiDAR\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u800c4D\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u96f7\u8fbe\uff08\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u5168\u5929\u5019\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u53ef\u6d4b\u901f\uff09\u4e0eLiDAR\u7684\u878d\u5408\u5c1a\u672a\u63a2\u7d22\uff1b\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e13\u7528\u96f7\u8fbe-LiDAR\u573a\u666f\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u96f7\u8fbe\u6570\u636e\u672c\u8eab\u5b58\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u5927\u3001\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u9996\u4e2aRadar-LiDAR\u573a\u666f\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u96f7\u8fbe\u53bb\u566a\u4e0e\u573a\u666f\u6d41\u6807\u7b7e\u751f\u6210\u7684\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1RaLiFlow\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u4e3aDynamic-aware Bidirectional Cross-modal Fusion\uff08DBCF\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5c06\u96f7\u8fbe\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5165\u5c40\u90e8\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4ee5\u6291\u5236\u96f7\u8fbe\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cd\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u81ea\u5efa\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRaLiFlow\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u6a21\u6001\uff08\u7eafLiDAR\u6216\u7eaf\u96f7\u8fbe\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u96f7\u8fbe\u4e0eLiDAR\u878d\u5408\u7528\u4e8e\u573a\u666f\u6d41\u4f30\u8ba1\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\uff1bDBCF\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u5b9a\u5236\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u878d\u5408\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff1b\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u96f7\u8fbe-LiDAR\u573a\u666f\u6d41\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u65b9\u6cd5\u7a7a\u767d\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose the variational mode-seeking loss (VML), which, when minimized during each reverse diffusion step, guides the generated sample towards the MAP estimate. VML arises from a novel perspective of minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the diffusion posterior $p(\\mathbf{x}_0|\\mathbf{x}_t)$ and the measurement posterior $p(\\mathbf{x}_0|\\mathbf{y})$, where $\\mathbf{y}$ denotes the measurement. Importantly, for linear inverse problems, VML can be analytically derived and need not be approximated.

Prior corrective approaches, such as Self-RAG, CRAG, and Adaptive-$k$, typically address this by \\textit{adding} more context or pruning existing lists.

We propose \\textbf{SEAL-RAG}, a training-free controller that adopts a \\textbf{``replace, don't expand''} strategy to fight context dilution under a fixed retrieval depth $k$. SEAL executes a (\\textbf{S}earch $\\rightarrow$ \\textbf{E}xtract $\\rightarrow$ \\textbf{A}ssess $\\rightarrow$ \\textbf{L}oop) cycle: it performs on-the-fly, entity-anchored extraction to build a live \\textit{gap specification} (missing entities/relations), triggers targeted micro-queries, and uses \\textit{entity-first ranking} to actively swap out distractors for gap-closing evidence. We evaluate SEAL-RAG against faithful re-implementations of Basic RAG, CRAG, Self-RAG, and Adaptive-$k$ in a shared environment on \\textbf{HotpotQA} and \\textbf{2WikiMultiHopQA}. On HotpotQA ($k=3$), SEAL improves answer correctness by \\textbf{+3--13 pp} and evidence precision by \\textbf{+12--18 pp} over Self-RAG.

This work aims to answer a fundamental question: How does diversity of values shape the collective behavior of AI communities? Using naturalistic value elicitation grounded in the prevalent Schwartz's Theory of Basic Human Values, we constructed multi-agent simulations where communities with varying numbers of agents engaged in open-ended interactions and constitution formation. The results show that value diversity enhances value stability, fosters emergent behaviors, and brings more creative principles developed by the agents themselves without external guidance. However, these effects also show diminishing returns: extreme heterogeneity induces instability.

In minimally invasive procedures, where visual input is the sole intraoperative modality, establishing precise pixel-level correspondences between endoscopic frames is critical for 3D reconstruction, camera tracking, and scene interpretation. However, the surgical domain presents distinct challenges: weak perspective cues, non-Lambertian tissue reflections, and complex, deformable anatomy degrade the performance of conventional computer vision techniques. While Deep Learning models have shown strong performance in natural scenes, their features are not inherently suited for fine-grained matching in surgical images and require targeted adaptation to meet the demands of this domain. This research presents a novel Deep Learning pipeline for establishing feature correspondences in endoscopic image pairs, alongside a self-supervised optimization framework for model training. The proposed methodology leverages a novel-view synthesis pipeline to generate ground-truth inlier correspondences, subsequently utilized for mining triplets within a contrastive learning paradigm. Through this self-supervised approach, we augment the DINOv2 backbone with an additional Transformer layer, specifically optimized to produce embeddings that facilitate direct matching through cosine similarity thresholding. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our pipeline surpasses state-of-the-art methodologies on the SCARED datasets improved matching precision and lower epipolar error compared to the related work.

In this work, we propose \\textbf{STA-Attention}, a framework that utilizes Top-K Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose the KV cache into interpretable ``semantic atoms.'' Unlike standard $L_1$-regularized SAEs, our Top-K approach eliminates shrinkage bias, preserving the precise dot-product geometry required for attention. Our analysis uncovers a fundamental \\textbf{Key-Value Asymmetry}: while Key vectors serve as highly sparse routers dominated by a ``Semantic Elbow,'' deep Value vectors carry dense content payloads requiring a larger budget. Based on this structure, we introduce a Dual-Budget Strategy that selectively preserves the most informative semantic components while filtering representational noise.

Reasoning can greatly improve language model capabilities and safety, but it also makes them less interactive: given a new input, a model must stop thinking before it can respond. Real-world use cases such as voice-based or embedded assistants require an LLM agent to respond and adapt to additional information in real time, which is incompatible with sequential interactions. In contrast, humans can listen, think, and act asynchronously: we begin thinking about the problem while reading it and continue thinking while formulating the answer. In this work, we augment LLMs capable of reasoning to operate in a similar way without additional training. Our method uses the properties of rotary embeddings to enable LLMs built for sequential interactions to simultaneously think, listen, and generate outputs. We evaluate our approach on math, commonsense, and safety reasoning and find that it can generate accurate thinking-augmented answers in real time, reducing time to first non-thinking token from minutes to <= 5s. and the overall real-time delays by 6-11x.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u589e\u5f3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u8fb9\u2018\u542c\u2019\u8fb9\u2018\u60f3\u2019\u8fb9\u2018\u7b54\u2019\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u54cd\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5177\u5907\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684LLM\u91c7\u7528\u4e32\u884c\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u5148\u601d\u8003\u518d\u56de\u7b54\uff09\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u8bed\u97f3\u52a9\u624b\u3001\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u8bbe\u5907\u7b49\u9700\u5b9e\u65f6\u54cd\u5e94\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\uff1b\u800c\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u5f02\u6b65\u5e76\u884c\u5730\u542c\u3001\u60f3\u3001\u8bf4\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u8ba9LLM\u6a21\u62df\u8fd9\u4e00\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u65cb\u8f6c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\uff08rotary embeddings\uff09\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u5df2\u5177\u5907\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406-\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u8026\u6539\u9020\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u63a5\u6536\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6301\u7eed\u601d\u8003\u5e76\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u5e38\u8bc6\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\uff1a\u9996\u975e\u601d\u8003token\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4ece\u5206\u949f\u7ea7\u964d\u81f3\u22645\u79d2\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u5b9e\u65f6\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e6\u201311\u500d\uff0c\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347LLM\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u901a\u7528\u3001\u514d\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9700\u6c42\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9e3f\u6c9f\u3002"}}

By incorporating intermediate exit branches into the architecture, they provide less computation for simpler samples, which is particularly beneficial for resource-constrained devices where energy consumption is crucial. However, designing early-exit networks is a challenging and time-consuming process due to the need to balance efficiency and performance. Recent works have utilized Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to design more efficient early-exit networks, aiming to reduce average latency while improving model accuracy by determining the best positions and number of exit branches in the architecture. Another important factor affecting the efficiency and accuracy of early-exit networks is the depth and types of layers in the exit branches. In this paper, we use hardware-aware NAS to strengthen exit branches, considering both accuracy and efficiency during optimization. Our performance evaluation on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN datasets demonstrates that our proposed framework, which considers varying depths and layers for exit branches along with adaptive threshold tuning, designs early-exit networks that achieve higher accuracy with the same or lower average number of MACs compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u786c\u4ef6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\u641c\u7d22\uff08NAS\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u65e9\u671f\u9000\u51fa\u7f51\u7edc\uff08early-exit networks\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u9000\u51fa\u5206\u652f\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5c42\u7c7b\u578b\uff09\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9608\u503c\u8c03\u4f18\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\uff08MACs\uff09\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u9000\u51fa\u7f51\u7edc\u5341\u5206\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9700\u6743\u8861\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b\u73b0\u6709NAS\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u5145\u5206\u8003\u8651\u9000\u51fa\u5206\u652f\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec6\u8282\u53ca\u786c\u4ef6\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u786c\u4ef6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\u641c\u7d22\uff08hardware-aware NAS\uff09\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u9000\u51fa\u5206\u652f\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u6570\u91cf\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u5c42\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9608\u503c\u8c03\u4f18\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-10\u3001CIFAR-100\u548cSVHN\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u6216\u66f4\u4f4e\u5e73\u5747MACs\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bd4\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9000\u51fa\u5206\u652f\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u5c42\u7c7b\u578b\uff09\u4e0e\u786c\u4ef6\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5316\u5bf9\u65e9\u671f\u9000\u51fa\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u80fd\u6548\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u534f\u540c\u63d0\u5347\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

Towards Label-Noise Resistant Information Bottleneck Learning", "comment": "Accepted by the Main Technical Track of the 40th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-2026)", "summary": "The Information Bottleneck (IB) principle facilitates effective representation learning by preserving label-relevant information while compressing irrelevant information. However, its strong reliance on accurate labels makes it inherently vulnerable to label noise, prevalent in real-world scenarios, resulting in significant performance degradation and overfitting. To address this issue, we propose LaT-IB, a novel Label-Noise ResistanT Information Bottleneck method which introduces a \"Minimal-Sufficient-Clean\" (MSC) criterion. Instantiated as a mutual information regularizer to retain task-relevant information while discarding noise, MSC addresses standard IB's vulnerability to noisy label supervision. To achieve this, LaT-IB employs a noise-aware latent disentanglement that decomposes the latent representation into components aligned with to the clean label space and the noise space. Theoretically, we first derive mutual information bounds for each component of our objective including prediction, compression, and disentanglement, and moreover prove that optimizing it encourages representations invariant to input noise and separates clean and noisy label information. Furthermore, we design a three-phase training framework: Warmup, Knowledge Injection and Robust Training, to progressively guide the model toward noise-resistant representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LaT-IB achieves superior robustness and efficiency under label noise, significantly enhancing robustness and applicability in real-world scenarios with label noise.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLaT-IB\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165Minimal-Sufficient-Clean\uff08MSC\uff09\u51c6\u5219\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u89e3\u8026\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\uff08IB\uff09\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6297\u566a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\uff08IB\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u51c6\u786e\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u4e0e\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u6297\u566a\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLaT-IB\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u542bMinimal-Sufficient-Clean\uff08MSC\uff09\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u51c6\u5219\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u89e3\u8026\uff08\u5206\u79bb\u6e05\u6d01\u6807\u7b7e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u566a\u58f0\u7a7a\u95f4\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caWarmup\u3001Knowledge Injection\u3001Robust Training\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u5e76\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u5404\u76ee\u6807\u9879\u7684\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4fc3\u4f7f\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u4e0d\u53d8\u4e14\u5206\u79bb\u6e05\u6d01\u4e0e\u566a\u58f0\u6807\u7b7e\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "LaT-IB\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u589e\u5f3aIB\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u542b\u566a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LaT-IB\u901a\u8fc7MSC\u51c6\u5219\u4e0e\u89e3\u8026\u5efa\u6a21\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3IB\u5bf9\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u5171\u540c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5176\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

We first study how the intrinsic properties of point-wise functions influence training and performance. Building on these findings, we conduct a large-scale search for a more effective function design. Through this exploration, we introduce $\\mathrm{Derf}(x) = \\mathrm{erf}(\u03b1x + s)$, where $\\mathrm{erf}(x)$ is the rescaled Gaussian cumulative distribution function, and identify it as the most performant design. Derf outperforms LayerNorm, RMSNorm, and DyT across a wide range of domains, including vision (image recognition and generation), speech representation, and DNA sequence modeling.

However, millions use LLMs for personal advice on high-stakes topics like finance and health, where harms are context-dependent rather than universal. While frameworks like the OECD's AI classification recognize the need to assess individual risks, user-welfare safety evaluations remain underdeveloped. We argue that developing such evaluations is non-trivial due to fundamental questions about accounting for user context in evaluation design. In this exploratory study, we evaluated advice on finance and health from GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro across user profiles of varying vulnerability. First, we demonstrate that evaluators must have access to rich user context: identical LLM responses were rated significantly safer by context-blind evaluators than by those aware of user circumstances, with safety scores for high-vulnerability users dropping from safe (5/7) to somewhat unsafe (3/7). One might assume this gap could be addressed by creating realistic user prompts containing key contextual information. However, our second study challenges this: we rerun the evaluation on prompts containing context users report they would disclose, finding no significant improvement. Our work establishes that effective user-welfare safety evaluation requires evaluators to assess responses against diverse user profiles, as realistic user context disclosure alone proves insufficient, particularly for vulnerable populations. By demonstrating a methodology for context-aware evaluation, this study provides both a starting point for such assessments and foundational evidence that evaluating individual welfare demands approaches distinct from existing universal-risk frameworks.

However, LiDAR-based point cloud acquisition is often affected by various disturbances, resulting in a large number of noise points that degrade the accuracy of subsequent point cloud object detection and recognition. Moreover, existing point cloud denoising methods typically sacrifice computational efficiency in pursuit of higher denoising accuracy, or, conversely, improve processing speed at the expense of preserving object boundaries and fine structural details, making it difficult to simultaneously achieve high denoising accuracy, strong edge preservation, and real-time performance. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an adaptive dual-weight gravitational-based point cloud denoising method. First, an octree is employed to perform spatial partitioning of the global point cloud, enabling parallel acceleration. Then, within each leaf node, adaptive voxel-based occupancy statistics and k-nearest neighbor (kNN) density estimation are applied to rapidly remove clearly isolated and low-density noise points, thereby reducing the effective candidate set. Finally, a gravitational scoring function that combines density weights with adaptive distance weights is constructed to finely distinguish noise points from object points. Experiments conducted on the Stanford 3D Scanning Repository, the Canadian Adverse Driving Conditions (CADC) dataset, and in-house FMCW LiDAR point clouds acquired in our laboratory demonstrate that, compared with existing methods, the proposed approach achieves consistent improvements in F1, PSNR, and Chamfer Distance (CD) across various noise conditions while reducing the single-frame processing time, thereby validating its high accuracy, robustness, and real-time performance in multi-noise scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53cc\u6743\u91cd\u5f15\u529b\u70b9\u4e91\u53bb\u566a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u516b\u53c9\u6811\u7a7a\u95f4\u5212\u5206\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f53\u7d20\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0ekNN\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u878d\u5408\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8ddd\u79bb\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u5f3a\u8fb9\u7f18\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd1\u5b9e\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u70b9\u4e91\u53bb\u566a\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u5f3a\u8fb9\u7f18\u4fdd\u6301\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\uff1bLiDAR\u91c7\u96c6\u6613\u53d7\u5e72\u6270\u5bfc\u81f4\u566a\u58f0\u591a\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u540e\u7eed\u68c0\u6d4b\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u516b\u53c9\u6811\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u5c40\u7a7a\u95f4\u5212\u5206\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5e76\u884c\u52a0\u901f\uff1b\u5728\u53f6\u8282\u70b9\u5185\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f53\u7d20\u5360\u636e\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0ekNN\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5feb\u901f\u5254\u9664\u5b64\u7acb\u4f4e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u566a\u58f0\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u878d\u5408\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6743\u91cd\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8ddd\u79bb\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u7cbe\u7ec6\u533a\u5206\u566a\u58f0\u70b9\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u5728Stanford 3D\u3001CADC\u53ca\u81ea\u7814FMCW LiDAR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cF1\u3001PSNR\u548cChamfer Distance\u6307\u6807\u5747\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5355\u5e27\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u53bb\u566a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u7c7b\u578b\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e0e\u4e09\u7ef4\u91cd\u5efa\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

A Progressive Investigation", "comment": "Code is released at https://github.com/Ivan-Tang-3D/3DGen-R1", "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL), earlier proven to be effective in large language and multi-modal models, has been successfully extended to enhance 2D image generation recently. However, applying RL to 3D generation remains largely unexplored due to the higher spatial complexity of 3D objects, which require globally consistent geometry and fine-grained local textures. This makes 3D generation significantly sensitive to reward designs and RL algorithms. To address these challenges, we conduct the first systematic study of RL for text-to-3D autoregressive generation across several dimensions. (1) Reward designs: We evaluate reward dimensions and model choices, showing that alignment with human preference is crucial, and that general multi-modal models provide robust signal for 3D attributes. (2) RL algorithms: We study GRPO variants, highlighting the effectiveness of token-level optimization, and further investigate the scaling of training data and iterations. (3) Text-to-3D Benchmarks: Since existing benchmarks fail to measure implicit reasoning abilities in 3D generation models, we introduce MME-3DR. (4) Advanced RL paradigms: Motivated by the natural hierarchy of 3D generation, we propose Hi-GRPO, which optimizes the global-to-local hierarchical 3D generation through dedicated reward ensembles. Based on these insights, we develop AR3D-R1, the first RL-enhanced text-to-3D model, expert from coarse shape to texture refinement. We hope this study provides insights into RL-driven reasoning for 3D generation.

However, many medical VLMs rely solely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which optimizes next-token prediction without evaluating answer quality. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) can incorporate task-specific feedback, and its combination with explicit intermediate reasoning (\"thinking\") has demonstrated substantial gains on verifiable math and coding tasks. To investigate the effects of RL and thinking in a CXR VLM, we perform large-scale SFT on CXR data to build an updated RadVLM based on Qwen3-VL, followed by a cold-start SFT stage that equips the model with basic thinking ability. We then apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with clinically grounded, task-specific rewards for report generation and visual grounding, and run matched RL experiments on both domain-specific and general-domain Qwen3-VL variants, with and without thinking. Across these settings, we find that while strong SFT remains crucial for high base performance, RL provides additional gains on both tasks, whereas explicit thinking does not appear to further improve results.

Existing research primarily focuses on video-level classification, leaving the practically crucial task of temporal localisation, identifying when hateful segments occur, largely unaddressed. This challenge is even more noticeable under weak supervision, where only video-level labels are available, and static fusion or classification-based architectures struggle to capture cross-modal and temporal dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose MultiHateLoc, the first framework designed for weakly-supervised multimodal hate localisation. MultiHateLoc incorporates (1) modality-aware temporal encoders to model heterogeneous sequential patterns, including a tailored text-based preprocessing module for feature enhancement; (2) dynamic cross-modal fusion to adaptively emphasise the most informative modality at each moment and a cross-modal contrastive alignment strategy to enhance multimodal feature consistency; (3) a modality-aware MIL objective to identify discriminative segments under video-level supervision. Despite relying solely on coarse labels, MultiHateLoc produces fine-grained, interpretable frame-level predictions. Experiments on HateMM and MultiHateClip show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the localisation task.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMultiHateLoc\uff0c\u9996\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ec7\u6068\u5185\u5bb9\u65f6\u5e8f\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u65f6\u5e8f\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5728\u4ec5\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u7ea7\u6807\u7b7e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e27\u7ea7\u4ec7\u6068\u7247\u6bb5\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u7ea7\u4ec7\u6068\u8bed\u97f3\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5173\u952e\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff08\u5373\u8bc6\u522b\u4ec7\u6068\u5185\u5bb9\u53d1\u751f\u65f6\u523b\uff09\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u89c6\u9891\u7ea7\u5f31\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u9759\u6001\u878d\u5408\u6216\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMultiHateLoc\u6846\u67b6\uff1a(1) \u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u65f6\u5e8f\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08\u542b\u6587\u672c\u9884\u5904\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\uff09\uff1b(2) \u52a8\u6001\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\uff1b(3) \u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MIL\uff09\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4ee5\u89c6\u9891\u7ea7\u6807\u7b7e\u76d1\u7763\u5e27\u7ea7\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "result": "\u5728HateMM\u548cMultiHateClip\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cMultiHateLoc\u5728\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u65f6\u5e8f\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53ef\u8f93\u51fa\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5e27\u7ea7\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "MultiHateLoc\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ec7\u6068\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u5b9a\u4f4d\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u77ed\u89c6\u9891\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

The first contribution addresses constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) under the average-cost criterion through the Average-Constrained Policy Optimization (ACPO) algorithm. ACPO integrates sensitivity analysis with trust-region updates to ensure stable constraint handling, achieving state-of-the-art empirical performance with theoretical guarantees. Constrained RL is then extended to finite-horizon settings via e-COP, the first policy optimization method for episodic CMDPs. Built on an episodic policy difference lemma, e-COP offers provable performance, simplicity, and scalability in safety-critical environments. The thesis then investigates reinforcement learning from human preferences. warmPref-PS introduces a posterior sampling strategy for linear bandits that integrates offline preference data from heterogeneous raters into online learning. Explicit modeling of rater competence yields substantial regret reduction and more efficient data collection for RLHF. The PSPL algorithm further advances preference-based RL by jointly sampling reward models and transition dynamics from pairwise trajectory comparisons, providing Bayesian simple-regret guarantees and robust empirical identification of optimal policies. The final contribution applies these methods to large-scale model alignment. A multi-objective constrained optimization view yields MOPO, an iterative algorithm with closed-form updates that scales to multi-billion-parameter language models and remains robust across alignment settings.

A significant domain gap causes advanced models to fail in wild terrains due to two key issues: lack of large-scale vectorized datasets and structural weakness in prevailing methods. Models such as SAM-Road employ a node-centric paradigm that reasons at sparse endpoints, making them fragile to occlusions and ambiguous junctions in off-road scenes, leading to topological errors.This work addresses these limitations in two complementary ways. First, we release WildRoad, a gloabal off-road road network dataset constructed efficiently with a dedicated interactive annotation tool tailored for road-network labeling. Second, we introduce MaGRoad (Mask-aware Geodesic Road network extractor), a path-centric framework that aggregates multi-scale visual evidence along candidate paths to infer connectivity robustly.Extensive experiments show that MaGRoad achieves state-of-the-art performance on our challenging WildRoad benchmark while generalizing well to urban datasets. A streamlined pipeline also yields roughly 2.5x faster inference, improving practical applicability.

While quantization techniques have successfully reduced resource requirements in standard deep learning models, their application to probabilistic models remains largely unexplored. We introduce a systematic multi-level quantization framework for Stochastic Variational Inference based BNNs that distinguishes between three quantization strategies: Variational Parameter Quantization (VPQ), Sampled Parameter Quantization (SPQ), and Joint Quantization (JQ). Our logarithmic quantization for variance parameters, and specialized activation functions to preserve the distributional structure are essential for calibrated uncertainty estimation. Through comprehensive experiments on Dirty-MNIST, we demonstrate that BNNs can be quantized down to 4-bit precision while maintaining both classification accuracy and uncertainty disentanglement. At 4 bits, Joint Quantization achieves up to 8x memory reduction compared to floating-point implementations with minimal degradation in epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty estimation.

General-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) shows promise but lacks domain-specific reliability. We evaluated the performance of CA-GPT, a novel large model deployed on an AI-OCT system, against that of the general-purpose ChatGPT-5 and junior physicians for OCT-guided PCI planning and assessment.\n  Methods: In this single-center analysis of 96 patients who underwent OCT-guided PCI, the procedural decisions generated by the CA-GPT, ChatGPT-5, and junior physicians were compared with an expert-derived procedural record. Agreement was assessed using ten pre-specified metrics across pre-PCI and post-PCI phases.\n  Results: For pre-PCI planning, CA-GPT demonstrated significantly higher median agreement scores (5[IQR 3.75-5]) compared to both ChatGPT-5 (3[2-4], P<0.001) and junior physicians (4[3-4], P<0.001). CA-GPT significantly outperformed ChatGPT-5 across all individual pre-PCI metrics and showed superior performance to junior physicians in stent diameter (90.3% vs. 72.2%, P<0.05) and length selection (80.6% vs. 52.8%, P<0.01). In post-PCI assessment, CA-GPT maintained excellent overall agreement (5[4.75-5]), significantly higher than both ChatGPT-5 (4[4-5], P<0.001) and junior physicians (5[4-5], P<0.05). Subgroup analysis confirmed CA-GPT's robust performance advantage in complex scenarios.\n  Conclusion: The CA-GPT-based AI-OCT system achieved superior decision-making agreement versus a general-purpose large language model and junior physicians across both PCI planning and assessment phases.

We propose TransLocNet, a cross-modal attention framework that fuses LiDAR geometry with aerial semantic context. LiDAR scans are projected into a bird's-eye-view representation and aligned with aerial features through bidirectional attention, followed by a likelihood map decoder that outputs spatial probability distributions over position and orientation.

The methodology integrates machine learning techniques with qualitative insights from migration experts. This approach aims at improving the predictive capacity of data-driven models through the inclusion of a human-assessed covariate, an innovation that addresses challenges posed by sudden shifts in migration patterns and limitations in traditional datasets. The proposed methodology responds directly to the forecasting needs outlined in the EU Pact on Migration and Asylum, supporting the Asylum and Migration Management Regulation (AMMR). It is designed to provide policy-relevant forecasts that inform strategic decisions, early warning systems, and solidarity mechanisms among EU Member States. By joining data-driven modeling with expert judgment, this work aligns with existing academic recommendations and introduces a novel operational tool tailored for EU migration governance.

Recently, Neural Collapse (NC) has been proposed as an emergent geometric property of deep neural networks (DNNs), providing valuable insights for TTA. In this work, we extend NC to the sample-wise level and discover a novel phenomenon termed Sample-wise Alignment Collapse (NC3+), demonstrating that a sample's feature embedding, obtained by a trained model, aligns closely with the corresponding classifier weight. Building on NC3+, we identify that the performance degradation stems from sample-wise misalignment in adaptation which exacerbates under larger distribution shifts. This indicates the necessity of realigning the feature embeddings with their corresponding classifier weights. However, the misalignment makes pseudo-labels unreliable under domain shifts. To address this challenge, we propose NCTTA, a novel feature-classifier alignment method with hybrid targets to mitigate the impact of unreliable pseudo-labels, which blends geometric proximity with predictive confidence. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of NCTTA in enhancing robustness to domain shifts.

We introduce token-sample complexity: the rate at which attention computed on $n$ tokens converges to its infinite-token limit. We estimate finite-$n$ convergence bounds at two levels: pointwise uniform convergence of the attention map, and convergence of moments for the transformed token distribution. For compactly supported (and more generally sub-Gaussian) distributions, our first result shows that the attention map converges uniformly on a ball of radius $R$ at rate $C(R)/\\sqrt{n}$, where $C(R)$ grows exponentially with $R$. For large $R$, this estimate loses practical value, and our second result addresses this issue by establishing convergence rates for the moments of the transformed distribution (the token output of the attention layer). In this case, the rate is $C'(R)/n^\u03b2$ with $\u03b2<\\tfrac{1}{2}$, and $C'(R)$ depends polynomially on the size of the support of the distribution. The exponent $\u03b2$ depends on the attention geometry and the spectral properties of the tokens distribution.

In realistic scenarios, variations across individuals, devices, environments, and time introduce significant distributional shifts for the same activities. Recent efforts attempt to solve this challenge by applying or adapting existing out-of-distribution (OOD) algorithms, but only in certain distribution shift scenarios (e.g., cross-device or cross-position), lacking comprehensive insights on the effectiveness of these algorithms. For instance, is OOD necessary to HAR? Which OOD algorithm performs the best? In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing HAROOD, a comprehensive benchmark for HAR in OOD settings. We define 4 OOD scenarios: cross-person, cross-position, cross-dataset, and cross-time, and build a testbed covering 6 datasets, 16 comparative methods (implemented with CNN-based and Transformer-based architectures), and two model selection protocols. Then, we conduct extensive experiments and present several findings for future research, e.g., no single method consistently outperforms others, highlighting substantial opportunity for advancement. Our codebase is highly modular and easy to extend for new datasets, algorithms, comparisons, and analysis, with the hope to facilitate the research in OOD-based HAR.

Explaining outliers is crucial for understanding the underlying factors that contribute to their detection, validating their significance, and identifying potential biases or errors. Effective explanations provide actionable insights, facilitating preventive measures to avoid similar outliers in the future. Counterfactual explanations clarify why specific data points are classified as outliers by identifying minimal changes required to alter their prediction. Although valuable, most existing counterfactual explanation methods overlook the unique challenges posed by outlier detection, and fail to target classical, widely adopted outlier detection algorithms. Local Outlier Factor (LOF) is one the most popular unsupervised outlier detection methods, quantifying outlierness through relative local density. Despite LOF's widespread use across diverse applications, it lacks interpretability. To address this limitation, we introduce Density-based Counterfactuals for Outliers (DCFO), a novel method specifically designed to generate counterfactual explanations for LOF. DCFO partitions the data space into regions where LOF behaves smoothly, enabling efficient gradient-based optimisation.

Existing human-in-the-loop approaches typically assume users begin with a clear, stable concept understanding to be able to provide high-quality supervision. In reality, users often start with a vague idea and must iteratively refine it through \"concept deliberation\", a practice we uncovered through structured interviews with content moderation experts. We operationalize the common strategies in deliberation used by real content moderators into a human-in-the-loop framework called \"Agile Deliberation\" that explicitly supports evolving and subjective concepts. The system supports users in defining the concept for themselves by exposing them to borderline cases. The system does this with two deliberation stages: (1) concept scoping, which decomposes the initial concept into a structured hierarchy of sub-concepts, and (2) concept iteration, which surfaces semantically borderline examples for user reflection and feedback to iteratively align an image classifier with the user's evolving intent. Since concept deliberation is inherently subjective and interactive, we painstakingly evaluate the framework through 18 user sessions, each 1.5h long, rather than standard benchmarking datasets. We find that Agile Deliberation achieves 7.5% higher F1 scores than automated decomposition baselines and more than 3% higher than manual deliberation, while participants reported clearer conceptual understanding and lower cognitive effort.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a'Agile Deliberation'\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7528\u6237\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u4e3b\u89c2\u4e14\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff08\u5982\u5185\u5bb9\u5ba1\u6838\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\uff08\u6982\u5ff5\u754c\u5b9a\u4e0e\u6982\u5ff5\u8fed\u4ee3\uff09\u9010\u6b65\u5398\u6e05\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347F1\u5206\u6570\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u8ba4\u77e5\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u7684\u7528\u6237\uff08\u5982\u5185\u5bb9\u5ba1\u6838\u5458\uff09\u5f80\u5f80\u4ece\u6a21\u7cca\u6982\u5ff5\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u590d\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u2018\u6982\u5ff5\u5546\u8bae\u2019\u6765\u660e\u786e\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u5047\u8bbe\u7528\u6237\u5df2\u6709\u6e05\u6670\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u5ba1\u6838\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u8bbf\u8c08\u63d0\u70bc\u51fa\u6982\u5ff5\u5546\u8bae\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6784\u5efaAgile Deliberation\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4e3a\u6982\u5ff5\u754c\u5b9a\uff08\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5206\u89e3\u521d\u59cb\u6982\u5ff5\uff09\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u4e3a\u6982\u5ff5\u8fed\u4ee3\uff08\u5448\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u8fb9\u754c\u6837\u4f8b\u4f9b\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\u4ee5\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff1b\u91c7\u752818\u573a\u6bcf\u573a1.5\u5c0f\u65f6\u7684\u7528\u6237\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6807\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u89e3\u57fa\u7ebfF1\u63d0\u53477.5%\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4eba\u5de5\u5546\u8bae\u63d0\u5347\u8d853%\uff1b\u7528\u6237\u62a5\u544a\u6982\u5ff5\u7406\u89e3\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8377\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u652f\u6301\u4e3b\u89c2\u3001\u6f14\u5316\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u6846\u67b6\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\uff0cAgile Deliberation\u4e3a\u5185\u5bb9\u5ba1\u6838\u7b49\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u8d34\u5408\u5b9e\u9645\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u7c7b\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

The separate-transform framework employs distinct transforms for intra-frame and inter-frame compression to yield impressive rate-distortion (R-D) performance but causes evident error propagation, while the unified-transform framework eliminates error propagation via shared transforms but is inferior in ME/MC in shared latent domains. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose a novel unifiedtransform framework with dual-domain progressive temporal alignment and quality-conditioned mixture-of-expert (QCMoE) to enable quality-consistent and error-propagation-free streaming for learned video compression. Specifically, we propose dualdomain progressive temporal alignment for ME/MC that leverages coarse pixel-domain alignment and refined latent-domain alignment to significantly enhance temporal context modeling in a coarse-to-fine fashion. The coarse pixel-domain alignment efficiently handles simple motion patterns with optical flow estimated from a single reference frame, while the refined latent-domain alignment develops a Flow-Guided Deformable Transformer (FGDT) over latents from multiple reference frames to achieve long-term motion refinement (LTMR) for complex motion patterns. Furthermore, we design a QCMoE module for continuous bit-rate adaptation that dynamically assigns different experts to adjust quantization steps per pixel based on target quality and content rather than relies on a single quantization step. QCMoE allows continuous and consistent rate control with appealing R-D performance. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves competitive R-D performance compared with the state-of-the-arts, while successfully eliminating error propagation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7edf\u4e00\u53d8\u6362\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53cc\u57df\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u65f6\u5e8f\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u6761\u4ef6\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\uff08QCMoE\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u3001\u8d28\u91cf\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6d41\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u89c6\u9891\u538b\u7f29\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u89c6\u9891\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u8865\u507f\uff08ME/MC\uff09\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u65f6\u5e8f\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u51c6\u4e0e\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u5206\u79bb\u53d8\u6362\u6846\u67b6R-D\u6027\u80fd\u597d\u4f46\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u4e25\u91cd\uff1b\u7edf\u4e00\u53d8\u6362\u6846\u67b6\u65e0\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u4f46ME/MC\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u57df\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u65f6\u5e8f\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08\u50cf\u7d20\u57df\u7c97\u5bf9\u9f50 + \u6f5c\u5728\u57df\u7cbe\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u542bFlow-Guided Deformable Transformer\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u5e27\u957f\u65f6\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ec6\u5316\uff09\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u6761\u4ef6\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\uff08QCMoE\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u6309\u76ee\u6807\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u5185\u5bb9\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u914d\u4e13\u5bb6\u4ee5\u9010\u50cf\u7d20\u8c03\u6574\u91cf\u5316\u6b65\u957f\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u65e0\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u7387\u5931\u771f\uff08R-D\uff09\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u7edf\u4e00\u53d8\u6362\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u57df\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0eQCMoE\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u517c\u987e\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6ME/MC\u4e0e\u65e0\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u8fde\u7eed\u7801\u7387\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u6d41\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u538b\u7f29\u3002"}}

While effective, the data structures and principles that enable this crucial capability remain poorly understood. We propose that compositional generalization fundamentally requires decomposing high-level concepts into basic, low-level concepts that can be recombined across similar contexts, similar to how humans draw analogies between concepts. For example, someone who has never seen a peacock eating rice can envision this scene by relating it to their previous observations of a chicken eating rice.\n  In this work, we formalize these intuitive processes using principles of causal modularity and minimal changes. We introduce a hierarchical data-generating process that naturally encodes different levels of concepts and their interaction mechanisms.

Most recent deep learning-based SFF methods typically operate in two stages: first, they extract focus volumes (a per pixel representation of focus likelihood across the focal stack) using heavy feature encoders; then, they estimate depth via a simple one-step aggregation technique that often introduces artifacts and amplifies noise in the depth map. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid framework. Our method computes multi-scale focus volumes traditionally using handcrafted Directional Dilated Laplacian (DDL) kernels, which capture long-range and directional focus variations to form robust focus volumes. These focus volumes are then fed into a lightweight, multi-scale GRU-based depth extraction module that iteratively refines an initial depth estimate at a lower resolution for computational efficiency. Finally, a learned convex upsampling module within our recurrent network reconstructs high-resolution depth maps while preserving fine scene details and sharp boundaries. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and traditional methods, achieving superior accuracy and generalization across diverse focal conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u7684Shape-from-Focus\uff08SFF\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u65b9\u5411\u81a8\u80c0\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\uff08DDL\uff09\u6838\u4e0e\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6GRU\u6df1\u5ea6\u63d0\u53d6\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u51f8\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u7ec6\u8282\u4fdd\u6301\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60SFF\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u5148\u7528\u91cd\u578b\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u63d0\u53d6\u7126\u70b9\u4f53\u79ef\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u805a\u5408\u4f30\u8ba1\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u6613\u5f15\u5165\u4f2a\u5f71\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684Directional Dilated Laplacian\uff08DDL\uff09\u6838\u63d0\u53d6\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7126\u70b9\u4f53\u79ef\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6GRU\u6a21\u5757\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u521d\u59cb\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1b\u5d4c\u5165\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u51f8\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u6a21\u5757\u91cd\u5efa\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u66f4\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8de8\u7126\u8ddd\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u517c\u987e\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u7126\u70b9\u4f53\u79ef\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u91cd\u5efa\u4e09\u65b9\u9762\u534f\u540c\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86SFF\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Proposal selection depends on assessing the relative strength among submitted proposals; however, traditional human scoring often suffers from weak inter-proposal correlations and is subject to reviewer bias and inconsistency. A pairwise preference-based approach is logically superior, providing a more rigorous and internally consistent basis for ranking, but its quadratic workload makes it impractical for human reviewers. We address this limitation using LLMs. Leveraging the uniquely well-curated proposals and publication records from three beamlines at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), we show that the LLM rankings correlate strongly with the human rankings (Spearman $\u03c1\\simeq 0.2-0.8$, improving to $\\geq 0.5$ after 10\\% outlier removal). Moreover, LLM performance is no worse than that of human reviewers in identifying proposals with high publication potential, while costing over two orders of magnitude less.

While methods like sparse autoencoders (SAEs) show remarkable empirical success, they often lack theoretical guarantees, risking subjective insights. Our primary objective is to establish a principled foundation for interpretable generative models. We demonstrate that the principle of causal minimality -- favoring the simplest causal explanation -- can endow the latent representations of diffusion vision and autoregressive language models with clear causal interpretation and robust, component-wise identifiable control. We introduce a novel theoretical framework for hierarchical selection models, where higher-level concepts emerge from the constrained composition of lower-level variables, better capturing the complex dependencies in data generation. Under theoretically derived minimality conditions (manifesting as sparsity or compression constraints), we show that learned representations can be equivalent to the true latent variables of the data-generating process. Empirically, applying these constraints to leading generative models allows us to extract their innate hierarchical concept graphs, offering fresh insights into their internal knowledge organization.

While prior research has mainly focused on improving decoders, the encoder's limited ability to extract meaningful features for unseen classes remains a key bottleneck. In this work, we introduce \\textit{Take a Peek} (TaP), a simple yet effective method that enhances encoder adaptability for both FSS and cross-domain FSS (CD-FSS). TaP leverages Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the encoder on the support set with minimal computational overhead, enabling fast adaptation to novel classes while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Our method is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing FSS pipelines. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks--including COCO $20^i$, Pascal $5^i$, and cross-domain datasets such as DeepGlobe, ISIC, and Chest X-ray--demonstrate that TaP consistently improves segmentation performance across diverse models and shot settings. Notably, TaP delivers significant gains in complex multi-class scenarios, highlighting its practical effectiveness in realistic settings.

The resulting operator, Green's-function Spherical Neural Operator (GSNO) with a novel spectral learning method, can adapt to anisotropic, constraint-rich systems while retaining spectral efficiency. To exploit GSNO, we develop GSHNet, a hierarchical architecture that combines multi-scale spectral modeling with spherical up-down sampling, enhancing global feature representation.

Humans, in comparison, perceive complex scenes efficiently by dynamically scanning and focusing on salient regions in a sequential \"blink-like\" process. Motivated by this strategy, we first investigate whether MLLMs exhibit similar behavior. Our pilot analysis reveals that MLLMs naturally attend to different visual regions across layers and that selectively allocating more computation to salient tokens can enhance visual perception. Building on this insight, we propose Blink, a dynamic visual token resolution framework that emulates the human-inspired process within a single forward pass. Specifically, Blink includes two modules: saliency-guided scanning and dynamic token resolution. It first estimates the saliency of visual tokens in each layer based on the attention map, and extends important tokens through a plug-and-play token super-resolution (TokenSR) module. In the next layer, it drops the extended tokens when they lose focus. This dynamic mechanism balances broad exploration and fine-grained focus, thereby enhancing visual perception adaptively and efficiently. Extensive experiments validate Blink, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing visual perception and multimodal understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faBlink\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u2018\u7728\u773c\u5f0f\u2019\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u52a8\u6001\u626b\u63cf\u548c\u805a\u7126\u663e\u8457\u533a\u57df\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5236\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76MLLMs\u662f\u5426\u5177\u5907\u7c7b\u4f3c\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u6709\u9650\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBlink\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u663e\u8457\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u626b\u63cf\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6807\u8bb0\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u4f30\u8ba1\u5404\u5c42\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u663e\u8457\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff08TokenSR\uff09\u6269\u5c55\u91cd\u8981\u6807\u8bb0\uff1b\u5728\u540e\u7eed\u5c42\u4e2d\u4e22\u5f03\u5931\u53bb\u5173\u6ce8\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6807\u8bb0\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86Blink\u5728\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Blink\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u5e73\u8861\u5e7f\u57df\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u805a\u7126\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86MLLMs\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Specifically, most existing GNNs mainly rely on the message passing strategy between neighbor nodes, where the expressivity is limited by the 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) test. Although a number of k-WL-based GNNs have been proposed to overcome this limitation, their computational cost increases rapidly with k, significantly restricting the practical applicability. Moreover, since the k-WL models mainly operate on node tuples, these k-WL-based GNNs cannot retain fine-grained node- or edge-level semantics required by attribution methods (e.g., Integrated Gradients), leading to the less interpretable problem. To overcome the above shortcomings, in this paper, we propose a novel Line Graph Aggregation Network (LGAN), that constructs a line graph from the induced subgraph centered at each node to perform the higher-order aggregation. We theoretically prove that the LGAN not only possesses the greater expressive power than the 2-WL under injective aggregation assumptions, but also has lower time complexity. Empirical evaluations on benchmarks demonstrate that the LGAN outperforms state-of-the-art k-WL-based GNNs, while offering better interpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u7ebf\u56fe\u805a\u5408\u7f51\u7edc\uff08LGAN\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u4ee5\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5b50\u56fe\u7684\u7ebf\u56fe\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u9636\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u7684GNN\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e1-WL\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff1bk-WL\u7c7bGNN\u867d\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5f52\u56e0\uff08\u5982Integrated Gradients\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLine Graph Aggregation Network\uff08LGAN\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8282\u70b9\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5b50\u56fe\u6784\u9020\u7ebf\u56fe\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u56fe\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u9636\u4fe1\u606f\u805a\u5408\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u5f3a\u4e8e2-WL\u4e14\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLGAN\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684k-WL\u7c7bGNN\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u5907\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LGAN\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u9636\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

To address this, we present a spatial representation method for grounding objects, namely GETok, that integrates a specialized vocabulary of learnable tokens into MLLMs. GETok first uses grid tokens to partition the image plane into structured spatial anchors, and then exploits offset tokens to enable precise and iterative refinement of localization predictions. By embedding spatial relationships directly into tokens, GETok significantly advances MLLMs in native 2D space reasoning without modifying the autoregressive architecture.

However, robust ISLR is fundamentally constrained by data scarcity and the long-tail distribution of sign vocabulary, where gathering sufficient examples for thousands of unique signs is prohibitively expensive. Standard classification approaches struggle under these conditions, often overfitting to frequent classes while failing to generalize to rare ones. To address this bottleneck, we propose a Few-Shot Prototypical Network framework adapted for a skeleton based encoder. Unlike traditional classifiers that learn fixed decision boundaries, our approach utilizes episodic training to learn a semantic metric space where signs are classified based on their proximity to dynamic class prototypes. We integrate a Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN) with a novel Multi-Scale Temporal Aggregation (MSTA) module to capture both rapid and fluid motion dynamics. Experimental results on the WLASL dataset demonstrate the superiority of this metric learning paradigm: our model achieves 43.75% Top-1 and 77.10% Top-5 accuracy on the test set. Crucially, this outperforms a standard classification baseline sharing the identical backbone architecture by over 13%, proving that the prototypical training strategy effectively outperforms in a data scarce situation where standard classification fails.

To address these limitations, we propose Concept Bottleneck Sparse Autoencoders (CB-SAE) - a novel post-hoc framework that prunes low-utility neurons and augments the latent space with a lightweight concept bottleneck aligned to a user-defined concept set.

In this work, we reveal a critical insight: well-crafted feature extraction inherently encodes degradation-carrying information, and a symmetric U-Net architecture is sufficient to unleash these cues effectively. By aligning feature scales across encoder-decoder and enabling streamlined cross-scale propagation, our symmetric design preserves intrinsic degradation signals robustly, rendering simple additive fusion in skip connections sufficient for state-of-the-art performance. Our primary baseline, SymUNet, is built on this symmetric U-Net and achieves better results across benchmark datasets than existing approaches while reducing computational cost. We further propose a semantic enhanced variant, SE-SymUNet, which integrates direct semantic injection from frozen CLIP features via simple cross-attention to explicitly amplify degradation priors.

Existing approaches often require large-scale player trajectories, train separate models for different player types, or provide no direct mapping between interpretable behavioral parameters and the learned policy, limiting their scalability and controllability. We define player behavior in an N-dimensional continuous space and uniformly sample target behavior vectors from a region that encompasses the subset representing real human styles. During training, each agent receives both its current and target behavior vectors as input, and the reward is based on the normalized reduction in distance between them. This allows the policy to learn how actions influence behavioral statistics, enabling smooth control over attributes such as aggressiveness, mobility, and cooperativeness. A single PPO-based multi-agent policy can reproduce new or unseen play styles without retraining. Experiments conducted in a custom multi-player Unity game show that the proposed framework produces significantly greater behavioral diversity than a win-only baseline and reliably matches specified behavior vectors across diverse targets. The method offers a scalable solution for automated playtesting, game balancing, human-like behavior simulation, and replacing disconnected players in online games.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u7c7b\u6e38\u620f\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728N\u7ef4\u8fde\u7eed\u884c\u4e3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u91c7\u6837\u76ee\u6807\u884c\u4e3a\u5411\u91cf\u5e76\u4ee5\u8ddd\u79bb\u7f29\u51cf\u4e3a\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u73a9\u5bb6\u884c\u4e3a\uff08\u5982\u653b\u51fb\u6027\u3001\u673a\u52a8\u6027\u3001\u5408\u4f5c\u6027\uff09\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\uff1b\u5355\u4e2aPPO\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7b56\u7565\u5373\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u81f3\u672a\u89c1\u884c\u4e3a\u98ce\u683c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u8f68\u8ff9\u3001\u9700\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u73a9\u5bb6\u7c7b\u578b\u5355\u72ec\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6216\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u884c\u4e3a\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49N\u7ef4\u8fde\u7eed\u884c\u4e3a\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\u8986\u76d6\u771f\u5b9e\u4eba\u7c7b\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u884c\u4e3a\u5411\u91cf\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u6bcf\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u540c\u65f6\u8f93\u5165\u5f53\u524d\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u884c\u4e3a\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5956\u52b1\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8c\u8005\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u51cf\u5c11\u91cf\uff1b\u91c7\u7528PPO\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49Unity\u591a\u4eba\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u884c\u4e3a\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u5339\u914d\u591a\u79cd\u6307\u5b9a\u884c\u4e3a\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u4e14\u5355\u7b56\u7565\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u5373\u53ef\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u6216\u672a\u89c1\u98ce\u683c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6e38\u620f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001\u5e73\u8861\u6027\u8c03\u8bd5\u3001\u7c7b\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u62df\u53ca\u5728\u7ebf\u6e38\u620f\u65ad\u8fde\u73a9\u5bb6\u66ff\u4ee3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u9ad8\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, most existing SOD methods assume low-noise visual conditions, overlooking the degradation of segmentation accuracy caused by weather-induced noise in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a SOD framework tailored for diverse weather conditions, encompassing a specific encoder and a replaceable decoder. To enable handling of varying weather noises, we introduce a one-hot vector as a noise indicator to represent different weather types and design a Noise Indicator Fusion Module (NIFM). The NIFM takes both semantic features and the noise indicator as dual inputs and is inserted between consecutive stages of the encoder to embed weather-aware priors via adaptive feature modulation. Critically, the proposed specific encoder retains compatibility with mainstream SOD decoders. Extensive experiments are conducted on the WXSOD dataset under varying training data scales (100%, 50%, 30% of the full training set), three encoder and seven decoder configurations. Results show that the proposed SOD framework (particularly the NIFM-enhanced specific encoder) improves segmentation accuracy under complex weather conditions compared to a vanilla encoder.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u591a\u53d8\u5929\u6c14\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u663e\u8457\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08SOD\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u6307\u793a\u7b26\uff08one-hot\u5411\u91cf\uff09\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6307\u793a\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff08NIFM\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u5929\u6c14\u611f\u77e5\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u5929\u6c14\u4e0b\u7684\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u4e3b\u6d41\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u663e\u8457\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u5047\u8bbe\u4f4e\u566a\u58f0\u89c6\u89c9\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5929\u6c14\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5305\u542b\u4e13\u7528\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u53ef\u66ff\u6362\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684SOD\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u566a\u58f0\u6307\u793a\u7b26\uff08one-hot\u5411\u91cf\uff09\u8868\u5f81\u4e0d\u540c\u5929\u6c14\u7c7b\u578b\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u566a\u58f0\u6307\u793a\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff08NIFM\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u566a\u58f0\u6307\u793a\u7b26\u53cc\u8f93\u5165\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u63d2\u5165\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5404\u9636\u6bb5\u95f4\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7279\u5f81\u8c03\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728WXSOD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c4\u6a21\uff08100%\u300150%\u300130%\uff09\u53ca\u591a\u79cd\u7f16\u7801\u5668/\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0b\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662fNIFM\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u4e13\u7528\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff09\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5929\u6c14\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u666e\u901a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "NIFM\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u5929\u6c14\u566a\u58f0\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u517c\u987e\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2SOD\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Leser"], "title": "Bayesian Symbolic Regression via Posterior Sampling", "comment": null, "summary": "Symbolic regression is a powerful tool for discovering governing equations directly from data, but its sensitivity to noise hinders its broader application. This paper introduces a Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) framework for Bayesian symbolic regression that approximates the posterior distribution over symbolic expressions, enhancing robustness and enabling uncertainty quantification for symbolic regression in the presence of noise. Differing from traditional genetic programming approaches, the SMC-based algorithm combines probabilistic selection, adaptive tempering, and the use of normalized marginal likelihood to efficiently explore the search space of symbolic expressions, yielding parsimonious expressions with improved generalization. When compared to standard genetic programming baselines, the proposed method better deals with challenging, noisy benchmark datasets. The reduced tendency to overfit and enhanced ability to discover accurate and interpretable equations paves the way for more robust symbolic regression in scientific discovery and engineering design applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e8f\u8d2f\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\uff08SMC\uff09\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b26\u53f7\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u9057\u4f20\u7f16\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0e\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e8f\u8d2f\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\uff08SMC\uff09\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u6982\u7387\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9000\u706b\u548c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u8fb9\u7f18\u4f3c\u7136\uff0c\u5728\u7b26\u53f7\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u542b\u566a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u9057\u4f20\u7f16\u7a0b\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u503e\u5411\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5730\u53d1\u73b0\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0e\u5de5\u7a0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

While large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising path to bridge this gap, existing methods often rely on costly, domain-specific training, and there is a lack of benchmarks to evaluate the practical utility of VLM-generated text in a zero-shot retrieval context. To address this research gap, we introduce the Remote Sensing Rich Text (RSRT) dataset, a new benchmark featuring multiple structured captions per image. Based on this dataset, we propose a fully training-free, text-only retrieval reference called TRSLLaVA. Our methodology reformulates cross-modal retrieval as a text-to-text (T2T) matching problem, leveraging rich text descriptions as queries against a database of VLM-generated captions within a unified textual embedding space. This approach completely bypasses model training or fine-tuning. Experiments on the RSITMD and RSICD benchmarks show our training-free method is highly competitive with state-of-the-art supervised models. For instance, on RSITMD, our method achieves a mean Recall of 42.62\\%, nearly doubling the 23.86\\% of the standard zero-shot CLIP baseline and surpassing several top supervised models. This validates that high-quality semantic representation through structured text provides a powerful and cost-effective paradigm for remote sensing image retrieval.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u6587\u672c\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5TRSLLaVA\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u591a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6807\u6ce8\u7684RSRT\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u5728\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u8bed\u4e49\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u8bed\u4e49\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaRemote Sensing Rich Text (RSRT)\u591a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u5b8c\u5168\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u9a71\u52a8\u7684TRSLLaVA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u5230\u6587\u672c\uff08T2T\uff09\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5339\u914d\u4eba\u5de5\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0eVLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002", "result": "\u5728RSITMD\u548cRSICD\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cTRSLLaVA\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u68c0\u7d22\u5e73\u5747\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u8fbe42.62%\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u6807\u51c6CLIP\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0823.86%\uff09\u7684\u4e24\u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u8d85\u8d8a\u591a\u4e2a\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u5f3a\u5927\u4e14\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, in many scientific and engineering domains, clean data are often unavailable: instead, we only observe measurements corrupted through a noisy, ill-conditioned channel. A generative model for the original data thus requires solving an inverse problem at the level of distributions. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to this task based on Stochastic Interpolants: we iteratively update a transport map between corrupted and clean data samples using only access to the corrupted dataset as well as black box access to the corruption channel. Under appropriate conditions, this iterative procedure converges towards a self-consistent transport map that effectively inverts the corruption channel, thus enabling a generative model for the clean data. We refer to the resulting method as the self-consistent stochastic interpolant (SCSI). It (i) is computationally efficient compared to variational alternatives, (ii) highly flexible, handling arbitrary nonlinear forward models with only black-box access, and (iii) enjoys theoretical guarantees. We demonstrate superior performance on inverse problems in natural image processing and scientific reconstruction, and establish convergence guarantees of the scheme under appropriate assumptions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u81ea\u6d3d\u968f\u673a\u63d2\u503c\uff08SCSI\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u4ec5\u6709\u88ab\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u75c5\u6001\u4fe1\u9053\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u65f6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u539f\u59cb\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u63d2\u503c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u66f4\u65b0\u4f20\u8f93\u6620\u5c04\u6765\u53cd\u6f14\u6c61\u67d3\u4fe1\u9053\uff0c\u5728\u4ec5\u8bbf\u95ee\u6c61\u67d3\u6570\u636e\u548c\u9ed1\u7bb1\u6c61\u67d3\u4fe1\u9053\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u5177\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u969c\u7684\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0e\u5de5\u7a0b\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u800c\u53ea\u80fd\u83b7\u53d6\u7ecf\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u75c5\u6001\u4fe1\u9053\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5c42\u9762\u6c42\u89e3\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u4ee5\u6784\u5efa\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u63d2\u503c\uff08Stochastic Interpolants\uff09\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u8fed\u4ee3\u66f4\u65b0\u4f20\u8f93\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u6c61\u67d3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u5bf9\u6c61\u67d3\u4fe1\u9053\u7684\u9ed1\u7bb1\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u6536\u655b\u5230\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u53cd\u6f14\u6c61\u67d3\u4fe1\u9053\u7684\u81ea\u6d3d\u4f20\u8f93\u6620\u5c04\u3002", "result": "SCSI\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u4e8e\u53d8\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u524d\u5411\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u4ec5\u9700\u9ed1\u7bb1\u8bbf\u95ee\uff09\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u7406\u8bba\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u548c\u79d1\u5b66\u91cd\u5efa\u7b49\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "SCSI\u4e3a\u5e26\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u75c5\u6001\u89c2\u6d4b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u53ef\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u4f20\u8f93\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0e\u5de5\u7a0b\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Understanding videos in challenging conditions like occlusion, camouflage, or rapid movement often depends more on motion dynamics than static appearance. TCAM autonomously observes a video, identifies multiple motion activities, and spatially grounds each natural language description to its corresponding trajectory through a motion-field attention mechanism. Our key insight is that motion patterns, when aligned with contrastive vision-language representations, provide powerful semantic signals for recognizing and describing actions. Through unified training that combines global video-text alignment with fine-grained spatial correspondence, TCAM enables query-free discovery of multiple motion expressions via multi-head cross-attention.

Discrete diffusion language models (DLMs) have been proposed as an alternative to autoregressive language models (ALMs). However, their scaling behavior has not yet been fully explored, with prior work suggesting that they require more data and compute to match the performance of ALMs.\n  We study the scaling behavior of DLMs on different noise types by smoothly interpolating between masked and uniform diffusion while paying close attention to crucial hyperparameters such as batch size and learning rate. Our experiments reveal that the scaling behavior of DLMs strongly depends on the noise type and is considerably different from ALMs. While all noise types converge to similar loss values in compute-bound scaling, we find that uniform diffusion requires more parameters and less data for compute-efficient training compared to masked diffusion, making them a promising candidate in data-bound settings. We scale our uniform diffusion model up to 10B parameters trained for $10^{22}$ FLOPs, confirming the predicted scaling behavior and making it the largest publicly known uniform diffusion model to date.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08DLMs\uff09\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u566a\u58f0\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0b\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5747\u5300\u6269\u6563\u6bd4\u63a9\u7801\u6269\u6563\u66f4\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u51fa\u76ee\u524d\u6700\u5927\u7684\u516c\u5f00\u5747\u5300\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0810B\u53c2\u6570\u300110^22 FLOPs\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08DLMs\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08ALMs\uff09\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5176\u7f29\u653e\u89c4\u5f8b\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\uff1b\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660eDLMs\u9700\u66f4\u591a\u6570\u636e\u548c\u7b97\u529b\u624d\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230ALMs\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u7f29\u653e\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u63a9\u7801\u6269\u6563\u4e0e\u5747\u5300\u6269\u6563\u4e4b\u95f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u63d2\u503c\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u566a\u58f0\u7c7b\u578b\u7684DLMs\u7f29\u653e\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u4e25\u683c\u63a7\u5236\u6279\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0DLMs\u7f29\u653e\u884c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u566a\u58f0\u7c7b\u578b\uff1a\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u53d7\u9650\u4e0b\u6240\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u7c7b\u578b\u6536\u655b\u81f3\u76f8\u4f3c\u635f\u5931\uff1b\u4f46\u5728\u6570\u636e\u53d7\u9650\u4e0b\uff0c\u5747\u5300\u6269\u6563\u6240\u9700\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u591a\u3001\u6570\u636e\u66f4\u5c11\uff0c\u66f4\u5177\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u6700\u7ec8\u5c06\u5747\u5300\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u81f310B\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u8017\u80fd10^22 FLOPs\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5747\u5300\u6269\u6563\u662f\u6570\u636e\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u66f4\u5177\u6f5c\u529b\u7684DLM\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5176\u7f29\u653e\u89c4\u5f8b\u663e\u8457\u533a\u522b\u4e8eALMs\uff0c\u4e14\u672c\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u8fc4\u4eca\u6700\u5927\u516c\u5f00\u5747\u5300\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

However, their strong performance relies on large training datasets, which are costly or risky to obtain, especially when adapting to new domains. Transfer learning is the natural way to adapt pretrained discrete diffusion models, but current methods require fine-tuning large diffusion models, which is computationally expensive and often impractical. Building on ratio-based transfer learning for continuous diffusion, we provide Guided Transfer Learning for discrete diffusion models (GTL). This enables sampling from a target distribution without modifying the pretrained denoiser. The same guidance formulation applies to both discrete-time diffusion and continuous-time score-based discrete diffusion, yielding a unified treatment. Guided discrete diffusion often requires many forward passes of the guidance network, which becomes impractical for large vocabularies and long sequences. To address this, we further present an efficient guided sampler that concentrates evaluations on planner-selected positions and top candidate tokens, thus lowering sampling time and computation. This makes guided language modeling practical at scale for large vocabularies and long sequences. We evaluate GTL on sequential data, including synthetic Markov chains and language modeling, and provide empirical analyses of its behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aGTL\uff08Guided Transfer Learning\uff09\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bcd\u6c47\u548c\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u6027\u80fd\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f46\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8de8\u57df\u9002\u914d\u65f6\u83b7\u53d6\u6570\u636e\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6216\u5b58\u5728\u98ce\u9669\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u8fc1\u79fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\u4e14\u4e0d\u5b9e\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u6269\u6563\u7684\u6bd4\u7387\u5f0f\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u601d\u60f3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\uff08\u542b\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u6570\u6269\u6563\uff09\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5f15\u5bfc\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6GTL\uff1b\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9ad8\u6548\u5f15\u5bfc\u91c7\u6837\u5668\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u89c4\u5212\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u5019\u9009\u8bcd\u4e0a\u96c6\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86GTL\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff1b\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u91c7\u6837\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\uff0c\u4f7f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bcd\u6c47\u548c\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u53d8\u5f97\u53ef\u884c\u3002", "conclusion": "GTL\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u514d\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u901a\u7528\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

While vision language models (VLMs) have significantly advanced this task, achieving reliable, high-quality parsing in real-world scenarios remains challenging. Common practice often selects the top-performing model on standard benchmarks. However, these benchmarks may carry dataset-specific biases, leading to inconsistent model rankings and limited correlation with real-world performance. Moreover, benchmark metrics typically provide only overall scores, which can obscure distinct error patterns in output. This raises a key challenge: how can we reliably and comprehensively assess document parsing quality in the wild? We address this problem with DOCR-Inspector, which formalizes document parsing assessment as fine-grained error detection and analysis. Leveraging VLM-as-a-Judge, DOCR-Inspector analyzes a document image and its parsed output, identifies all errors, assigns them to one of 28 predefined types, and produces a comprehensive quality assessment. To enable this capability, we construct DOCRcase-200K for training and propose the Chain-of-Checklist reasoning paradigm to enable the hierarchical structure of parsing quality assessment. For empirical validation, we introduce DOCRcaseBench, a set of 882 real-world document parsing cases with manual annotations. On this benchmark, DOCR-Inspector-7B outperforms commercial models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, as well as leading open-source models. Further experiments demonstrate that its quality assessments provide valuable guidance for parsing results refinement, making DOCR-Inspector both a practical evaluator and a driver for advancing document parsing systems at scale.

Beyond their interpretability benefits, counterfactuals can also be leveraged for model reconstruction, where a surrogate model is trained to replicate the behavior of a target model. In this work, we demonstrate that model reconstruction can be significantly improved by recognizing that counterfactuals, which typically lie close to the decision boundary, can serve as informative though less representative samples for both classes. This is particularly beneficial in settings with limited access to labeled data. We propose a method that integrates original data samples with counterfactuals to approximate class prototypes using the Wasserstein barycenter, thereby preserving the underlying distributional structure of each class. This approach enhances the quality of the surrogate model and mitigates the issue of decision boundary shift, which commonly arises when counterfactuals are naively treated as ordinary training instances.

While recent deep learning-based trackers achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on challenging benchmarks, their reliance on per-frame GPU inference poses a major barrier to deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, where compute, power, and connectivity are limited. We introduce K-Track (Kalman-enhanced Tracking), a general-purpose, tracker-agnostic acceleration framework designed to bridge this deployment gap. K-Track reduces inference cost by combining sparse deep learning keyframe updates with lightweight Kalman filtering for intermediate frame prediction, using principled Bayesian uncertainty propagation to maintain temporal coherence. This hybrid strategy enables 5-10X speedup while retaining over 85% of the original trackers' accuracy. We evaluate K-Track across multiple state-of-the-art point trackers and demonstrate real-time performance on edge platforms such as the NVIDIA Jetson Nano and RTX Titan. By preserving accuracy while dramatically lowering computational requirements, K-Track provides a practical path toward deploying high-quality point tracking in real-world, resource-limited settings, closing the gap between modern tracking algorithms and deployable vision systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "K-Track\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u52a0\u901f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7a00\u758f\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0e\u8f7b\u91cf\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u630185%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b05\u201310\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u70b9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u70b9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5668\u867d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u4f9d\u8d56\u9010\u5e27GPU\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u529f\u8017\u548c\u8fde\u63a5\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faK-Track\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5728\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u8fd0\u884c\u5b8c\u6574\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5668\uff0c\u4e2d\u95f4\u5e27\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u662ftracker-agnostic\u7684\u901a\u7528\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aSOTA\u70b9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5668\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b05\u201310\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u4e14\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4fdd\u6301\u8d8585%\uff1b\u5728NVIDIA Jetson Nano\u548cRTX Titan\u7b49\u8fb9\u7f18\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "K-Track\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u8fb9\u7f18\u90e8\u7f72\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u9ad8\u8d28\u7684\u70b9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The method exploits nocturnal homogenization periods -- when hot oil is circulated through a non-irradiated field -- to isolate hydraulic and thermal-loss effects. A differentiable conjugate heat-transfer model is discretized and embedded into an end-to-end learning pipeline optimized using historical plant data from the 50 MW Andasol 3 solar field.\n  The model accurately reconstructs loop temperatures (RMSE $<2^\\circ$C) and produces physically meaningful estimates of loop imbalances and receiver heat losses.

In this paper, we introduce TriDF, a comprehensive benchmark for interpretable DeepFake detection. TriDF contains high-quality forgeries from advanced synthesis models, covering 16 DeepFake types across image, video, and audio modalities. The benchmark evaluates three key aspects: Perception, which measures the ability of a model to identify fine-grained manipulation artifacts using human-annotated evidence; Detection, which assesses classification performance across diverse forgery families and generators; and Hallucination, which quantifies the reliability of model-generated explanations. Experiments on state-of-the-art multimodal large language models show that accurate perception is essential for reliable detection, but hallucination can severely disrupt decision-making, revealing the interdependence of these three aspects.

However, with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), full retraining to recover pruning-induced performance degradation is often prohibitive and classical approaches such as global magnitude pruning are suboptimal on Transformer architectures. State-of-the-art methods hence solve a layer-wise mask selection problem, the problem of finding a pruning mask which minimizes the per-layer pruning error on a small set of calibration data. Exactly solving this problem to optimality using Integer Programming (IP) solvers is computationally infeasible due to its combinatorial nature and the size of the search space, and existing approaches therefore rely on approximations or heuristics. In this work, we demonstrate that the mask selection problem can be made drastically more tractable at LLM scale. To that end, we decouple the rows by enforcing equal sparsity levels per row. This allows us to derive optimal 1-swaps (exchanging one kept and one pruned weight) that can be computed efficiently using the Gram matrix of the calibration data. Using these observations, we propose a tractable and simple 1-swap algorithm that warm starts from any pruning mask, runs efficiently on GPUs at LLM scale, and is essentially hyperparameter-free. We demonstrate that our approach reduces per-layer pruning error by up to 60% over Wanda (Sun et al., 2023) and consistently improves perplexity and zero-shot accuracy across state-of-the-art GPT architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u76841-swap\u526a\u679d\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u884c\u7ea7\u7b49\u7a00\u758f\u7ea6\u675f\u548cGram\u77e9\u9635\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f18\u6743\u91cd\u4ea4\u6362\uff0c\u5728LLM\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u9010\u5c42\u526a\u679d\u8bef\u5dee\uff08\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe60%\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u51e0\u4e4e\u65e0\u9700\u8c03\u53c2\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u5168\u5c40\u5e45\u5ea6\u526a\u679d\uff09\u5728Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff1b\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6574\u6570\u89c4\u5212\u7cbe\u786e\u6c42\u89e3\u5c42\u5185\u63a9\u7801\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6216\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u884c\u7ea7\u7b49\u7a00\u758f\u7ea6\u675f\u76841-swap\u526a\u679d\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a\u5148\u5bf9\u6bcf\u884c\u5f3a\u5236\u7edf\u4e00\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u4ee5\u89e3\u8026\u4f18\u5316\uff1b\u518d\u5229\u7528\u6821\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u7684Gram\u77e9\u9635\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f18\u5355\u6b21\u6743\u91cd\u4ea4\u6362\uff08\u5373\u4e00\u4e2a\u4fdd\u7559\u6743\u4e0e\u4e00\u4e2a\u526a\u9664\u6743\u4e92\u6362\uff09\uff1b\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ece\u4efb\u610f\u521d\u59cb\u63a9\u7801\u70ed\u542f\u52a8\uff0c\u652f\u6301GPU\u9ad8\u6548\u5e76\u884c\u6267\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdbGPT\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4Wanda\uff082023\uff09\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u9010\u5c42\u526a\u679d\u8bef\u5dee\u6700\u9ad8\u964d\u4f4e60%\uff0c\u5e76\u4e00\u81f4\u6539\u5584\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u7b80\u5316\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u4f7f\u5c42\u5185\u63a9\u7801\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\u5728LLM\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u53d8\u5f97\u5207\u5b9e\u53ef\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u9ad8\u6548\u526a\u679d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u2014\u2014\u517c\u987e\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u6613\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

While traditional rule-based systems can react to these commands, they often struggle in dynamic environments, and end-to-end methods face challenges in complying with explicit navigation commands. To address this, we present NaviHydra, a controllable navigation-guided end-to-end model distilled from an existing rule-based simulator. Our framework accepts high-level navigation commands as control signals, generating trajectories that align with specified intentions. We utilize a Bird's Eye View (BEV) based trajectory gathering method to enhance the trajectory feature extraction.

While current models excel at capturing an object's surface geometry and appearance, they largely neglect its internal physical properties. This omission is critical, as properties like volumetric density are fundamental for predicting an object's center of mass, stability, and interaction dynamics in applications ranging from robotic manipulation to physical simulation. The primary bottleneck has been the absence of large-scale, real-world data. To bridge this gap, we introduce XDen-1K, the first large-scale, multi-modal dataset designed for real-world physical property estimation, with a particular focus on volumetric density. The core of this dataset consists of 1,000 real-world objects across 148 categories, for which we provide comprehensive multi-modal data, including a high-resolution 3D geometric model with part-level annotations and a corresponding set of real-world biplanar X-ray scans. Building upon this data, we introduce a novel optimization framework that recovers a high-fidelity volumetric density field of each object from its sparse X-ray views. To demonstrate its practical value, we add X-ray images as a conditioning signal to an existing segmentation network and perform volumetric segmentation. Furthermore, we conduct experiments on downstream robotics tasks. The results show that leveraging the dataset can effectively improve the accuracy of center-of-mass estimation and the success rate of robotic manipulation.

However, these approaches often introduce high latency, elevated energy consumption, and deployment risks related to connectivity, cost, and data governance; factors that conflict with the practical constraints of real-world robotics, where compute is limited and on-device inference is frequently required. We introduce Geo6DPose, a lightweight, fully local, and training-free pipeline for zero-shot 6D pose estimation that trades model scale for geometric reliability. Our method combines foundation model visual features with a geometric filtering strategy: Similarity maps are computed between onboarded template DINO descriptors and scene patches, and mutual correspondences are established by projecting scene patch centers to 3D and template descriptors to the object model coordinate system. Final poses are recovered via correspondence-driven RANSAC and ranked using a weighted geometric alignment metric that jointly accounts for reprojection consistency and spatial support, improving robustness to noise, clutter, and partial visibility. Geo6DPose achieves sub-second inference on a single commodity GPU while matching the average recall of significantly larger zero-shot baselines (53.7 AR, 1.08 FPS).

Currently, efficient SMLM requires non-overlapping emitting fluorophores, leading to long acquisition times that hinders live-cell imaging. Recent deep-learning approaches can handle denser emissions, but they rely on variants of non-maximum suppression (NMS) layers, which are unfortunately non-differentiable and may discard true positives with their local fusion strategy. In this presentation, we reformulate the SMLM training objective as a set-matching problem, deriving an optimal-transport loss that eliminates the need for NMS during inference and enables end-to-end training.

While prior work has largely focused on pixel-level uncertainty, landmark-based segmentation offers inherent topological guarantees yet remains underexplored from an uncertainty perspective. In this work, we study uncertainty estimation for anatomical landmark-based segmentation on chest X-rays. Inspired by hybrid neural network architectures that combine standard image convolutional encoders with graph-based generative decoders, and leveraging their variational latent space, we derive two complementary measures: (i) latent uncertainty, captured directly from the learned distribution parameters, and (ii) predictive uncertainty, obtained by generating multiple stochastic output predictions from latent samples. Through controlled corruption experiments we show that both uncertainty measures increase with perturbation severity, reflecting both global and local degradation. We demonstrate that these uncertainty signals can identify unreliable predictions by comparing with manual ground-truth, and support out-of-distribution detection on the CheXmask dataset. More importantly, we release CheXmask-U (huggingface.co/datasets/mcosarinsky/CheXmask-U), a large scale dataset of 657,566 chest X-ray landmark segmentations with per-node uncertainty estimates, enabling researchers to account for spatial variations in segmentation quality when using these anatomical masks. Our findings establish uncertainty estimation as a promising direction to enhance robustness and safe deployment of landmark-based anatomical segmentation methods in chest X-ray.

In many real-world scenarios, such as acquiring data from public repositories or sharing across institutions, data is naturally organized into discrete datasets that vary in relevance, quality, and utility. Selecting which repositories or institutions to search for useful datasets, and which datasets to incorporate into model training are therefore critical decisions, yet most existing methods select individual samples and treat all data as equally relevant, ignoring differences between datasets and their sources. In this work, we formalize the task of dataset selection: selecting entire datasets from a large, heterogeneous pool to improve downstream performance under resource constraints. We propose Dataset Selection via Hierarchies (DaSH), a dataset selection method that models utility at both dataset and group (e.g., collections, institutions) levels, enabling efficient generalization from limited observations. Across two public benchmarks (Digit-Five and DomainNet), DaSH outperforms state-of-the-art data selection baselines by up to 26.2% in accuracy, while requiring significantly fewer exploration steps. Ablations show DaSH is robust to low-resource settings and lack of relevant datasets, making it suitable for scalable and adaptive dataset selection in practical multi-source learning workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aDaSH\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u7ec4\uff08\u5982\u673a\u6784\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5408\uff09\u4e24\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\u4e0a\u5efa\u6a21\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u4e0b\u4ece\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u6c60\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ca\u5176\u6765\u6e90\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3001\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u5929\u7136\u6309\u6765\u6e90\u5206\u7ec4\u6210\u79bb\u6563\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDataset Selection via Hierarchies (DaSH)\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u5c42\u7684\u7ec4\uff08\u5982\u673a\u6784\u6216\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5408\uff09\u4e24\u4e2a\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5efa\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u89c2\u6d4b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u591a\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "result": "\u5728Digit-Five\u548cDomainNet\u4e24\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cDaSH\u76f8\u6bd4SOTA\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u57fa\u7ebf\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534726.2%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u6240\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u6b65\u9aa4\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\uff1b\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4ecd\u5177\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DaSH\u4e3a\u591a\u6e90\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7ea7\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6837\u672c\u7ea7\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7f3a\u9677\u3002"}}

However, we find that current VLMs struggle to understand fine-grained 3D spatial relationships which is a fundamental requirement for systems interacting with the physical world. To address this issue, we propose SpaceDrive, a spatial-aware VLM-based driving framework that treats spatial information as explicit positional encodings (PEs) instead of textual digit tokens, enabling joint reasoning over semantic and spatial representations. SpaceDrive employs a universal positional encoder to all 3D coordinates derived from multi-view depth estimation, historical ego-states, and text prompts. These 3D PEs are first superimposed to augment the corresponding 2D visual tokens. Meanwhile, they serve as a task-agnostic coordinate representation, replacing the digit-wise numerical tokens as both inputs and outputs for the VLM. This mechanism enables the model to better index specific visual semantics in spatial reasoning and directly regress trajectory coordinates rather than generating digit-by-digit, thereby enhancing planning accuracy. Extensive experiments validate that SpaceDrive achieves state-of-the-art open-loop performance on the nuScenes dataset and the second-best Driving Score of 78.02 on the Bench2Drive closed-loop benchmark over existing VLM-based methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSpaceDrive\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u9a71\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c063D\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u663e\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\uff08PEs\uff09\u800c\u975e\u6570\u5b57\u6587\u672c\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u63d0\u5347VLM\u5bf9\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea63D\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eVLM\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u76843D\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSpaceDrive\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u901a\u7528\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u3001\u5386\u53f2\u81ea\u8f66\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u76843D\u5750\u6807\u7edf\u4e00\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a3D\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\uff08PEs\uff09\uff1b\u8fd9\u4e9bPEs\u65e2\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a2D\u89c6\u89c9token\uff0c\u53c8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5750\u6807\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u6570\u5b57token\u4f5c\u4e3aVLM\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u8054\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u53ca\u8f68\u8ff9\u5750\u6807\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u56de\u5f52\u3002", "result": "\u5728nuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u5f00\u73af\u6027\u80fdSOTA\uff0c\u5728Bench2Drive\u95ed\u73af\u57fa\u51c6\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f9778.02\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u5f97\u5206\uff0c\u4f4d\u5c45VLM\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b2c\u4e8c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a213D\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u4e3a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u8865VLM\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Standard NFs consist of a forward process and a reverse process: the forward process maps data to noise, while the reverse process generates samples by inverting it. Typical NF forward transformations are constrained by explicit invertibility, ensuring that the reverse process can serve as their exact analytic inverse. Recent developments in TARFlow and its variants have revitalized NF methods by combining Transformers and autoregressive flows, but have also exposed causal decoding as a major bottleneck. In this work, we introduce Bidirectional Normalizing Flow ($\\textbf{BiFlow}$), a framework that removes the need for an exact analytic inverse. BiFlow learns a reverse model that approximates the underlying noise-to-data inverse mapping, enabling more flexible loss functions and architectures. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that BiFlow, compared to its causal decoding counterpart, improves generation quality while accelerating sampling by up to two orders of magnitude. BiFlow yields state-of-the-art results among NF-based methods and competitive performance among single-evaluation (\"1-NFE\") methods.

However, existing methods either rely on simple frame-by-frame monocular models, leading to temporal inconsistencies and inaccuracies, or use computationally demanding temporal modeling, unsuitable for real-time applications. These limitations significantly restrict general applicability and performance in practical settings. To address this, we propose VeloDepth, an efficient and robust online video depth estimation pipeline that effectively leverages spatiotemporal priors from previous depth predictions and performs deep feature propagation. Our method introduces a novel Propagation Module that refines and propagates depth features and predictions using flow-based warping coupled with learned residual corrections. In addition, our design structurally enforces temporal consistency, resulting in stable depth predictions across consecutive frames with improved efficiency. Comprehensive zero-shot evaluation on multiple benchmarks demonstrates the state-of-the-art temporal consistency and competitive accuracy of VeloDepth, alongside its significantly faster inference compared to existing video-based depth estimators. VeloDepth thus provides a practical, efficient, and accurate solution for real-time depth estimation suitable for diverse perception tasks.

However, these models typically treat understanding and generation separately, limiting the mutual benefits that could arise from interactive feedback between tasks. In this work, we reveal that motion assessment and refinement tasks act as crucial bridges to enable bidirectional knowledge flow between understanding and generation. Leveraging this insight, we propose Interleaved Reasoning for Motion Generation (IRMoGen), a novel paradigm that tightly couples motion generation with assessment and refinement through iterative text-motion dialogue. To realize this, we introduce IRG-MotionLLM, the first model that seamlessly interleaves motion generation, assessment, and refinement to improve generation performance. IRG-MotionLLM is developed progressively with a novel three-stage training scheme, initializing and subsequently enhancing native IRMoGen capabilities. To facilitate this development, we construct an automated data engine to synthesize interleaved reasoning annotations from existing text-motion datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that: (i) Assessment and refinement tasks significantly improve text-motion alignment; (ii) Interleaving motion generation, assessment, and refinement steps yields consistent performance gains across training stages; and (iii) IRG-MotionLLM clearly outperforms the baseline model and achieves advanced performance on standard text-to-motion generation benchmarks. Cross-evaluator testing further validates its effectiveness.

However, CFD is computationally expensive, time-consuming, and difficult to integrate into large-scale clinical workflows. These limitations restrict the availability of labeled hemodynamic data for training AI models and hinder broad adoption of non-invasive, physiology based CAD assessment. To address these challenges, we develop an end to end pipeline that automates coronary geometry extraction from coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA), streamlines simulation data generation, and enables efficient learning of coronary blood pressure distributions. The pipeline reduces the manual burden associated with traditional CFD workflows while producing consistent training data. We further introduce a diffusion-based regression model designed to predict coronary blood pressure directly from CCTA derived features, bypassing the need for slow CFD computation during inference.

Existing approaches often rely on random or static patch selection, leading to the inclusion of redundant or non-informative regions that degrade performance. To address this, we propose a Graph Laplacian Attention-Based Transformer (GLAT) integrated with an Iterative Refinement Module (IRM) to enhance both feature learning and spatial consistency. The IRM iteratively refines patch selection by leveraging a pretrained ResNet50 for local feature extraction and a foundation model in no-gradient mode for importance scoring, ensuring only the most relevant tissue regions are preserved. The GLAT models tissue-level connectivity by constructing a graph where patches serve as nodes, ensuring spatial consistency through graph Laplacian constraints and refining feature representations via a learnable filtering mechanism that enhances discriminative histological structures. Additionally, a convex aggregation mechanism dynamically adjusts patch importance to generate a robust WSI-level representation.

When domain generalization (DG) encounters noise, noisy labels further exacerbate the emergence of spurious features in deep layers, i.e. spurious feature enlargement, leading to a degradation in the performance of existing algorithms. This paper, starting from domain generalization, explores how to make existing methods rework when meeting noise. We find that the latent features inside the model have certain discriminative capabilities, and different latent features focus on different parts of the image. Based on these observations, we propose the Self-Ensemble Post Learning approach (SEPL) to diversify features which can be leveraged. Specifically, SEPL consists of two parts: feature probing training and prediction ensemble inference. It leverages intermediate feature representations within the model architecture, training multiple probing classifiers to fully exploit the capabilities of pre-trained models, while the final predictions are obtained through the integration of outputs from these diverse classification heads. Considering the presence of noisy labels, we employ semi-supervised algorithms to train probing classifiers. Given that different probing classifiers focus on different areas, we integrate their predictions using a crowdsourcing inference approach.

Existing approaches typically rely on explicitly constructing feature correspondences between the query image and either the object model or template images. In this work, we propose PoseGAM, a geometry-aware multi-view framework that directly predicts object pose from a query image and multiple template images, eliminating the need for explicit matching. Built upon recent multi-view-based foundation model architectures, the method integrates object geometry information through two complementary mechanisms: explicit point-based geometry and learned features from geometry representation networks. In addition, we construct a large-scale synthetic dataset containing more than 190k objects under diverse environmental conditions to enhance robustness and generalization.

The scarcity of large-scale, naturally captured 4D mesh datasets further limits the ability to train generalizable video-to-4D models from scratch in a purely data-driven manner. Meanwhile, advances in image-to-3D generation, supported by extensive datasets, offer powerful prior models that can be leveraged. To better utilize these priors while minimizing reliance on 4D supervision, we introduce SWiT-4D, a Sliding-Window Transformer for lossless, parameter-free temporal 4D mesh generation. SWiT-4D integrates seamlessly with any Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based image-to-3D generator, adding spatial-temporal modeling across video frames while preserving the original single-image forward process, enabling 4D mesh reconstruction from videos of arbitrary length. To recover global translation, we further introduce an optimization-based trajectory module tailored for static-camera monocular videos. SWiT-4D demonstrates strong data efficiency: with only a single short (<10s) video for fine-tuning, it achieves high-fidelity geometry and stable temporal consistency, indicating practical deployability under extremely limited 4D supervision. Comprehensive experiments on both in-domain zoo-test sets and challenging out-of-domain benchmarks (C4D, Objaverse, and in-the-wild videos) show that SWiT-4D consistently outperforms existing baselines in temporal smoothness.

Yet there is still no comprehensive benchmark that holistically assesses the progress toward this goal. In this work, we introduce MMSI-Video-Bench, a fully human-annotated benchmark for video-based spatial intelligence in MLLMs. It operationalizes a four-level framework, Perception, Planning, Prediction, and Cross-Video Reasoning, through 1,106 questions grounded in 1,278 clips from 25 datasets and in-house videos. Each item is carefully designed and reviewed by 3DV experts with explanatory rationales to ensure precise, unambiguous grounding. Leveraging its diverse data sources and holistic task coverage, MMSI-Video-Bench also supports three domain-oriented sub-benchmarks (Indoor Scene Perception Bench, Robot Bench and Grounding Bench) for targeted capability assessment. We evaluate 25 strong open-source and proprietary MLLMs, revealing a striking human--AI gap: many models perform near chance, and the best reasoning model lags humans by nearly 60%. We further find that spatially fine-tuned models still fail to generalize effectively on our benchmark. Fine-grained error analysis exposes systematic failures in geometric reasoning, motion grounding, long-horizon prediction, and cross-video correspondence. We also show that typical frame-sampling strategies transfer poorly to our reasoning-intensive benchmark, and that neither 3D spatial cues nor chain-of-thought prompting yields meaningful gains.

To assess the potential of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in this domain, we propose a systematic benchmark framework MiSI-Bench. This framework features over 163,000 question-answer pairs and 587,000 images derived from approximately 4,000 molecular structures, covering nine complementary tasks that evaluate abilities ranging from elementary spatial transformations to complex relational identifications. Experimental results reveal that current state-of-the-art VLMs perform significantly below human level on this benchmark. However, a fine-tuned 7B model demonstrates substantial potential, even surpassing humans in spatial transformation tasks, while its poor performance in scientifically-grounded tasks like hydrogen bond recognition underscores the necessity of integrating explicit domain knowledge for progress toward scientific AGI.

We formalize this gap as Category-Agnostic Motion Capture (CAMoCap): given a monocular video and an arbitrary rigged 3D asset as a prompt, the goal is to reconstruct a rotation-based animation such as BVH that directly drives the specific asset. We present MoCapAnything, a reference-guided, factorized framework that first predicts 3D joint trajectories and then recovers asset-specific rotations via constraint-aware inverse kinematics. The system contains three learnable modules and a lightweight IK stage: (1) a Reference Prompt Encoder that extracts per-joint queries from the asset's skeleton, mesh, and rendered images; (2) a Video Feature Extractor that computes dense visual descriptors and reconstructs a coarse 4D deforming mesh to bridge the gap between video and joint space; and (3) a Unified Motion Decoder that fuses these cues to produce temporally coherent trajectories. We also curate Truebones Zoo with 1038 motion clips, each providing a standardized skeleton-mesh-render triad. Experiments on both in-domain benchmarks and in-the-wild videos show that MoCapAnything delivers high-quality skeletal animations and exhibits meaningful cross-species retargeting across heterogeneous rigs, enabling scalable, prompt-driven 3D motion capture for arbitrary assets.

However, state-of-the-art models still struggle on recent motion benchmarks, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale, fine-grained motion datasets.

To address this challenge, we introduce FoundationMotion, a fully automated data curation pipeline that constructs large-scale motion datasets. Our approach first detects and tracks objects in videos to extract their trajectories, then leverages these trajectories and video frames with Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate fine-grained captions and diverse question-answer pairs about motion and spatial reasoning. Using datasets produced by this pipeline, we fine-tune open-source models including NVILA-Video-15B and Qwen2.5-7B, achieving substantial improvements in motion understanding without compromising performance on other tasks. Notably, our models outperform strong closed-source baselines like Gemini-2.5 Flash and large open-source models such as Qwen2.5-VL-72B across diverse motion understanding datasets and benchmarks. FoundationMotion thus provides a scalable solution for curating fine-grained motion datasets that enable effective fine-tuning of diverse models to enhance motion understanding and spatial reasoning capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFoundationMotion\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6574\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u8f68\u8ff9\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8fd0\u52a8\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6700\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFoundationMotion\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6570\u636e\u6574\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e76\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7269\u4f53\u4ee5\u63d0\u53d6\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u751f\u6210\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8fd0\u52a8\u63cf\u8ff0\u53ca\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u7528\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5fae\u8c03\u5f00\u6e90\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982NVILA-Video-15B\u3001Qwen2.5-7B\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8fd0\u52a8\u7406\u89e3\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f3a\u95ed\u6e90\u57fa\u7ebf\uff08\u5982Gemini-2.5 Flash\uff09\u548c\u5927\u578b\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982Qwen2.5-VL-72B\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u672a\u635f\u5bb3\u5176\u4ed6\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "FoundationMotion\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8fd0\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u5e7f\u6cdb\u652f\u6301\u5404\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

We introduce BabyVLM-V2, a developmentally grounded framework for infant-inspired vision-language modeling that extensively improves upon BabyVLM-V1 through a longitudinal, multifaceted pretraining set, a versatile model, and, most importantly, DevCV Toolbox for cognitive evaluation. The pretraining set maximizes coverage while minimizing curation of a longitudinal, infant-centric audiovisual corpus, yielding video-utterance, image-utterance, and multi-turn conversational data that mirror infant experiences. DevCV Toolbox adapts all vision-related measures of the recently released NIH Baby Toolbox into a benchmark suite of ten multimodal tasks, covering spatial reasoning, memory, and vocabulary understanding aligned with early children's capabilities. Experimental results show that a compact model pretrained from scratch can achieve competitive performance on DevCV Toolbox, outperforming GPT-4o on some tasks.

We address this problem by mapping Gaussian Splatting using 3D Morphable Models to generate person-specific avatars.

Therefore, these fragmented approaches are trained on disjoint slices of available 3D/4D data. We introduce OmniView, a unified framework that generalizes across a wide range of 4D consistency tasks. Our method separately represents space, time, and view conditions, enabling flexible combinations of these inputs. For example, OmniView can synthesize novel views from static, dynamic, and multiview inputs, extrapolate trajectories forward and backward in time, and create videos from text or image prompts with full camera control. OmniView is competitive with task-specific models across diverse benchmarks and metrics, improving image quality scores among camera-conditioned diffusion models by up to 33\\% in multiview NVS LLFF dataset, 60\\% in dynamic NVS Neural 3D Video benchmark, 20\\% in static camera control on RE-10K, and reducing camera trajectory errors by 4x in text-conditioned video generation. With strong generalizability in one model, OmniView demonstrates the feasibility of a generalist 4D video model.

Existing multimodal models exploring the potential of reasoning with images are brittle and do not scale. They rely on calling specialist tools, costly generation of images, or handcrafted reasoning data to switch between text and image thoughts. Instead, we offer a simpler alternative -- Mull-Tokens -- modality-agnostic latent tokens pre-trained to hold intermediate information in either image or text modalities to let the model think free-form towards the correct answer. We investigate best practices to train Mull-Tokens inspired by latent reasoning frameworks. We first train Mull-Tokens using supervision from interleaved text-image traces, and then fine-tune without any supervision by only using the final answers. Across four challenging spatial reasoning benchmarks involving tasks such as solving puzzles and taking different perspectives, we demonstrate that Mull-Tokens improve upon several baselines utilizing text-only reasoning or interleaved image-text reasoning, achieving a +3% average improvement and up to +16% on a puzzle solving reasoning-heavy split compared to our strongest baseline.

Instead of autoregressively generating tokens as in classical VLMs, VL-JEPA predicts continuous embeddings of the target texts. By learning in an abstract representation space, the model focuses on task-relevant semantics while abstracting away surface-level linguistic variability. In a strictly controlled comparison against standard token-space VLM training with the same vision encoder and training data, VL-JEPA achieves stronger performance while having 50% fewer trainable parameters. At inference time, a lightweight text decoder is invoked only when needed to translate VL-JEPA predicted embeddings into text. We show that VL-JEPA natively supports selective decoding that reduces the number of decoding operations by 2.85x while maintaining similar performance compared to non-adaptive uniform decoding. Beyond generation, the VL-JEPA's embedding space naturally supports open-vocabulary classification, text-to-video retrieval, and discriminative VQA without any architecture modification. On eight video classification and eight video retrieval datasets, the average performance VL-JEPA surpasses that of CLIP, SigLIP2, and Perception Encoder.

However, existing methods lack fine-grained temporal control over subject appearance and disappearance, which are essential for applications such as compositional video synthesis, storyboarding, and controllable animation. We propose AlcheMinT, a unified framework that introduces explicit timestamps conditioning for subject-driven video generation. Our approach introduces a novel positional encoding mechanism that unlocks the encoding of temporal intervals, associated in our case with subject identities, while seamlessly integrating with the pretrained video generation model positional embeddings. Additionally, we incorporate subject-descriptive text tokens to strengthen binding between visual identity and video captions, mitigating ambiguity during generation. Through token-wise concatenation, AlcheMinT avoids any additional cross-attention modules and incurs negligible parameter overhead. We establish a benchmark evaluating multiple subject identity preservation, video fidelity, and temporal adherence. Experimental results demonstrate that AlcheMinT achieves visual quality matching state-of-the-art video personalization methods, while, for the first time, enabling precise temporal control over multi-subject generation within videos.

Existing referring video segmentation datasets often focus on salient objects and use language expressions rich in static attributes, potentially allowing the target object to be identified in a single frame. Such datasets underemphasize the role of motion in both videos and languages. To explore the feasibility of using motion expressions and motion reasoning clues for pixel-level video understanding, we introduce MeViS, a dataset containing 33,072 human-annotated motion expressions in both text and audio, covering 8,171 objects in 2,006 videos of complex scenarios. We benchmark 15 existing methods across 4 tasks supported by MeViS, including 6 referring video object segmentation (RVOS) methods, 3 audio-guided video object segmentation (AVOS) methods, 2 referring multi-object tracking (RMOT) methods, and 4 video captioning methods for the newly introduced referring motion expression generation (RMEG) task. The results demonstrate weaknesses and limitations of existing methods in addressing motion expression-guided video understanding. We further analyze the challenges and propose an approach LMPM++ for RVOS/AVOS/RMOT that achieves new state-of-the-art results.

Flex employs a small set of learnable scene tokens to jointly encode information from all image tokens across different cameras and timesteps. By design, our approach is geometry-agnostic, learning a compact scene representation directly from data without relying on the explicit 3D inductive biases, such as Bird-Eye-View (BEV), occupancy or tri-plane representations, which are common in prior work. This holistic encoding strategy aggressively compresses the visual input for the downstream Large Language Model (LLM) based policy model. Evaluated on a large-scale proprietary dataset of 20,000 driving hours, our Flex achieves 2.2x greater inference throughput while improving driving performance by a large margin compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we show that these compact scene tokens develop an emergent capability for scene decomposition without any explicit supervision.

However, existing methods often fail to explicitly model degradation types and struggle to adapt their restoration behavior to complex or mixed degradations. To address these issues, we propose ClusIR, a Cluster-Guided Image Restoration framework that explicitly models degradation semantics through learnable clustering and propagates cluster-aware cues across spatial and frequency domains for adaptive restoration. Specifically, ClusIR comprises two key components: a Probabilistic Cluster-Guided Routing Mechanism (PCGRM) and a Degradation-Aware Frequency Modulation Module (DAFMM). The proposed PCGRM disentangles degradation recognition from expert activation, enabling discriminative degradation perception and stable expert routing.

NFMs directly map monocular visual input to control actions and ignore mid-level vision modules (tracking, depth estimation, etc) entirely. While the assumption that vision capabilities will emerge implicitly is compelling, it requires large amounts of pixel-to-action supervision that are difficult to obtain. The challenge is especially pronounced in dynamic and unstructured settings, where robust navigation requires precise geometric and dynamic understanding, while the depth-scale ambiguity in monocular views further limits accurate spatial reasoning. In this paper, we show that relying on monocular vision and ignoring mid-level vision priors is inefficient.\n  We present StereoWalker, which augments NFMs with stereo inputs and explicit mid-level vision such as depth estimation and dense pixel tracking. Our intuition is straightforward: stereo inputs resolve the depth-scale ambiguity, and modern mid-level vision models provide reliable geometric and motion structure in dynamic scenes. We also curate a large stereo navigation dataset with automatic action annotation from Internet stereo videos to support training of StereoWalker and to facilitate future research. Through our experiments, we find that mid-level vision enables StereoWalker to achieve a comparable performance as the state-of-the-art using only 1.5% of the training data, and surpasses the state-of-the-art using the full data.

Due to the lack of sufficient open-set de-occlusion and pose estimation priors, existing methods struggle to simultaneously produce high-quality geometry and accurate poses under severe occlusion and open-set settings. To address these issues, we first decouple the de-occlusion model from 3D object generation, and enhance it by leveraging image datasets and collected de-occlusion datasets for much more diverse open-set occlusion patterns. Then, we propose a unified pose estimation model that integrates global and local mechanisms for both self-attention and cross-attention to improve accuracy.

Despite rapid progress, the field still lacks a unified way to assess whether generated worlds preserve geometry, obey physics, or support reliable control. We introduce WorldLens, a full-spectrum benchmark evaluating how well a model builds, understands, and behaves within its generated world. It spans five aspects -- Generation, Reconstruction, Action-Following, Downstream Task, and Human Preference -- jointly covering visual realism, geometric consistency, physical plausibility, and functional reliability. Across these dimensions, no existing world model excels universally: those with strong textures often violate physics, while geometry-stable ones lack behavioral fidelity. To align objective metrics with human judgment, we further construct WorldLens-26K, a large-scale dataset of human-annotated videos with numerical scores and textual rationales, and develop WorldLens-Agent, an evaluation model distilled from these annotations to enable scalable, explainable scoring. Together, the benchmark, dataset, and agent form a unified ecosystem for measuring world fidelity -- standardizing how future models are judged not only by how real they look, but by how real they behave.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86WorldLens\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u751f\u6210\u3001\u91cd\u5efa\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u8ddf\u968f\u3001\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u4e94\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86WorldLens-26K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cWorldLens-Agent\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u7edf\u4e00\u8861\u91cf\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u89c9\u903c\u771f\u76844D\u9a7e\u9a76\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\u4e0e\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0a\u5e38\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faWorldLens\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u751f\u6210\u3001\u91cd\u5efa\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u8ddf\u968f\u3001\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u4e94\u65b9\u9762\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u542b26K\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u89c6\u9891\u7684WorldLens-26K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684WorldLens-Agent\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff08\u5982\u7eb9\u7406\u5f3a\u8005\u5e38\u8fdd\u7269\u7406\uff0c\u51e0\u4f55\u7a33\u8005\u7f3a\u884c\u4e3a\u4fdd\u771f\uff09\uff1bWorldLens-Agent\u80fd\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ba2\u89c2\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "conclusion": "WorldLens\u53ca\u5176\u914d\u5957\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u6210\u7edf\u4e00\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ece\u2018\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u771f\u5b9e\u2019\u8f6c\u5411\u2018\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u771f\u5b9e\u2019\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8861\u91cf\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}
